## Property Characteristics (Target Profile)

### Must Have:
- [ ] Existing dwelling or structure suitable for demolition
- [ ] Freehold tenure (no complex leasehold issues)
- [ ] Clear title (no ransom strips or access issues)
- [ ] Plot size sufficient for 3-4 bed detached/semi-detached house (typically 200-400 sqm)
- [ ] Residential planning zone (C3 use class or allocatable)
- [ ] Road access (existing or createable)
- [ ] Located in built-up areas (not isolated rural)

### Positive Signals:
- [ ] Poor condition building (signals motivated seller + justifies demolition)
- [ ] Low EPC rating (D, E, F, G) - improvement too costly, rebuild makes sense
- [ ] Long hold period (20+ years) - non-core asset, potential motivation
- [ ] Corporate/estate ownership (easier negotiation than emotional homeowner)
- [ ] Previous planning approvals in area (demonstrates planning viability)
- [ ] Expired planning permission on site (shows planning history positive)
- [ ] Similar recent approvals nearby (de-risks planning strategy)

### Acquisition Price Targets by Area:
- **Bromley/Greenwich/Bexley:** £150k - £250k (lower value areas)
- **Croydon/Lewisham:** £150k - £250k
- **Hillingdon/Hounslow/Ealing:** £180k - £280k (Hillingdon reference case area)
- **Outer London (Havering/Barking/Enfield):** £100k - £200k (potentially better value)

---

## Planning Strategy

### Approach:
**Full Planning Application** (not Permitted Development)

### Justification Angles:
1. **Improvement over existing:** Replace poor quality dwelling with high-quality new build
2. **Energy efficiency:** New build meets current Building Regs (Part L), existing cannot economically
3. **Design quality:** Better design, landscaping, amenity space
4. **Compliance:** Modern building meets all current standards (fire safety, accessibility, insulation)
5. **Precedent:** Reference Hillingdon case and similar local approvals

### Planning Risks to Avoid:
- ❌ Conservation Areas with strict design controls
- ❌ Listed buildings or curtilage
- ❌ Green Belt (unless previously developed)
- ❌ Article 4 directions blocking demolition
- ❌ TPOs covering >30% of plot (limits buildable area)
- ❌ Flood Zone 3
- ❌ No recent similar approvals (indicates planning resistance)

1. **"Run down homes" (646 sites)** is the most directly relevant preset - targets low-EPC single homes perfect for demolish/rebuild
2. **"Unsold homes with poor EPC" (12,379 sites)** is massive but needs heavy filtering - indicates motivated sellers
3. **Class ZA (162 sites)** offers alternative PD route for commercial-to-residential rebuild
4. **Zero results** on care homes and nutrient neutrality farmland suggest these strategies won't work in target LPAs
5. **Strong results** (500+ sites) across multiple presets indicate healthy market with many options

### Multi-LLM Generation Strategy:
**4-6 divergent approaches** will be independently generated by:
- Gemini (2 approaches)
- Codex (2 approaches)
- Grok (1-2 approaches)
- Claude (1-2 approaches)

Each LLM will generate unique SearchLand filter combinations targeting:
- Different price points (£100k-£300k acquisition)
- Different property conditions (EPC-based, derelict, stalled planning)
- Different ownership signals (corporate, long hold, motivated)
- Different geographic focus (outer vs inner boroughs)
- Different preset combinations (may start from "Run down homes", "Unsold homes with poor EPC", "Class ZA", or build custom from scratch)

## Risk Factors

### Acquisition Risks:
- Properties at target price point (£100k-£300k) in London are rare
- Motivated sellers may have hidden issues (structural, contamination)
- Corporate portfolios may have strategic value (not actually for sale)

### Planning Risks:
- Local resistance to demolition (character, heritage concerns)
- Trend toward retrofit/refurb over demolition (climate policies)
- Longer decision times (12-18 months typical)
- Section 106 obligations eating into profit
- CIL (Community Infrastructure Levy) costs

### Build Cost Risks:
- Inflation in construction costs (2024-2025 volatile)
- £2,000-£2,500/sqm may be optimistic for quality new build
- Utility connections (can add £20k-£50k if not on site)
- Abnormal costs (contamination, piling, drainage)

### Market Risks:
- GDV assumptions based on current market (could fall)
- Outer London boroughs may have weaker demand
- Oversupply of new build in some areas
- Longer sales period (9-12 months) ties up capital

---

## Mitigation Strategies

### De-Risk Planning:
- Focus on LPAs with positive demolition/rebuild precedents
- Target plots with previous approvals (even if expired)
- Pre-application advice before acquisition (£2k-£5k)
- Site in areas with housing need/allocations

### De-Risk Build Costs:
- Get QS estimates on target properties before committing
- Build in 20% contingency
- Use proven contractors with fixed-price contracts
- Modular/modern methods of construction for cost certainty

### De-Risk Acquisition:
- Full structural survey before exchange
- Environmental desktop study (contamination check)
- Title checks with solicitor (access, covenants, restrictions)
- Negotiate subject-to-planning clauses (or option agreements)

## Key Questions for Multi-LLM System

1. **What acquisition price point is realistic in each LPA?**
2. **What property conditions signal motivated sellers AND demolition viability?**
3. **Which ownership types are best targets? (Corporate, estate, long-hold private)**
4. **Should we focus on C3 residential only, or include commercial-to-resi (Class ZA)?**
5. **What's the optimal plot size range? (Too small = constrained, too large = expensive)**
6. **Which LPAs have the best planning track record for demolish/rebuild?**
7. **Are there stalled planning permission properties we can revive?**
8. **What EPC thresholds indicate "too costly to refurb, rebuild better"?**

## 🔬 TESTING LOG (2024-12-17)

### Original Strategy: Demolish/Rebuild Arbitrage

**Objective:** Find poor condition homes to demolish and rebuild for £500k-£1m profit

### Test 1: Run Down Homes (Preset)

**Screenshot Reference:** Run down homes preset showing 646 results

**Base Preset Filters:**
```
+ Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
+ EPC rating: is one of [G, E, F, D]
+ Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
+ Ownership type: isn't one of [Corporate, Council, Housing Association, Company]
+ Developed area percentage: is less than [30]
+ Title area (acres): is between [0.494] and [1.013]
+ Number of addresses: is equal to [1]
+ Property classification: contains all [Detached]
```

**Result:** 646 opportunities found ✅

**Metrics shown:**
- Plot area (avg): 2624 / m²
- Developed area (avg): 270 / m²
- With residential planning: 37.0%

---

### Test 2: Run Down Homes + Motivated Seller Signals

**Objective:** Narrow 646 to most motivated sellers

| Additional Filter | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| + Sales listing status: Available | **0 results** ❌ |
| + Building on title is derelict: Yes | **0 results** ❌ |
| + Building on title is inactive: Yes | **0 results** ❌ |
| + Latest sold date: <1995-01-01 | **0 results** ❌ |

**Conclusion:** Adding ANY motivated seller signal to the preset returns zero. The base preset already excludes most properties with these data fields populated.

---

### PIVOT: Time-Based Arbitrage Strategy

**Rationale:** Static "motivated seller" filters don't work. Pivot to time-based arbitrage where events trigger motivation.

---

### Test 3: Recent Planning Apps (Last 30 Days)

**Screenshot Reference:** Recent Planning Apps filter showing 272 results

**Objective:** Find owners with fresh planning approvals who don't know market value

**Base Filter:**
```
+ Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
+ Last application submitted: is after [2024-11-17]
+ Proposal: contains [dwelling]
+ Proposal: contains [residential]  
+ Proposal: contains [flats]
+ Title area (acres): is greater than or equal to [0.25]
+ Title area (acres): is less than or equal to [2]
```

**Result:** 272 opportunities found ✅

**Metrics shown:**
- Plot area (avg): 2928 / m²
- Developed area (avg): 853 / m²
- With residential planning: 97.4%

---

### Test 4: Recent Planning Apps + Unaware Owner Signals

**Screenshot Reference:** Refined filter showing 0 results

**Objective:** Narrow to owners who don't yet know their planning approval value

**Additional Filters:**
```
+ Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
+ Latest sold date: is before [2015-01-01]
+ Sales listing currently on the market: is [false]
+ Number of addresses: is equal to [1]
```

**Result:** 0 opportunities found ❌

**Metrics shown:**
- Plot area (avg): Unknown
- Developed area (avg): Unknown
- With residential planning: 0.0%

**Conclusion:** The "unaware owner" concept doesn't work via SearchLand. Properties with recent planning apps in London are mostly owned by developers/investors (recent purchases, already marketing).

---

### Next Tests Queued (Arbitrage Strategies)

| # | Preset | Baseline Count | Arbitrage Mechanism |
|---|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Emerging Sites Without Planning** | 53 sites | Site allocated but owner unaware |
| 2 | HMO Expired Licenses | 331 sites | License expired = compliance pressure |
| 3 | Commercial Expiring Leases | 153 sites | Lease ending = void period pressure |

---

## 📝 KEY LEARNINGS SO FAR

### What Doesn't Work in 17 London LPAs:
1. ❌ "Run down homes" + motivated seller filters = 0 results
2. ❌ "Recent planning apps" + unaware owner filters = 0 results
3. ❌ Day-0 planning consent arbitrage (not filterable in SearchLand)

### What Might Work:
1. ⏳ Allocation arbitrage (sites allocated but no planning app yet)
2. ⏳ Licensing arbitrage (HMO licenses expired)
3. ⏳ Lease expiry arbitrage (commercial leases ending soon)

### SearchLand Limitations Discovered:
- No "Planning status" filter (Approved/Refused/Pending)
- No "Approved in last X days" filter
- No real-time alerts or delta monitoring
- Data completeness varies significantly by field

### Filter Sensitivity:
- Base presets: 100s-1000s of results
- +1-2 filters: Significant narrowing
- +3-4 filters: Often returns 0 (too restrictive)

---

## 🔄 REVISED STRATEGY

**Original:** Demolish/rebuild arbitrage (find run-down homes)  
**Pivot:** Time-based arbitrage (allocation, licensing, lease expiry)

**Next Step:** Test "Emerging Sites Without Planning" preset

---

**Status:** Testing in Progress  
**Current Focus:** Arbitrage opportunities (time-based triggers)
