# SearchLand Filter Projects Index

**Purpose:** Track all filter creation projects for learning and reference  
**System Version:** 3.1 (Divergent + 86 Preset Analysis as of 2025-11-19)

---

## System Evolution Note

**v3.1 (2025-11-19+):** Projects now use Divergent Hypothesis Testing + 86 Preset Insights
- 4-6 competing approaches tested in parallel
- Enriched knowledge: 16 motivation signals, 35 strategies, 12 pattern categories
- Empirical validation (SearchLand results decide)
- Universal learnings captured in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
- 6-stage workflow: Requirements → Divergent Generation → Validity → Testing → Site Validation → Deep Research

**v3.0 (2025-11-19):** Initial divergent methodology  
**v2.x (2025-01-19):** Multi-iteration consensus (archived)

## Active Projects

### 1. MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v8 (2025-11-20) 🚀 IN PROGRESS - v8.0 (Full Context Fix)

**Requirements:**
- £2M profit from £200k capital (10x ROI)
- 8-storey mixed-use development opportunities (Class E + C3)
- Reference planning application provided

**Status:** Stage 0 - Independent Generation (Running)

**System Version:** v8.0
- ✅ Full context inclusion fix (ALL reference materials via `cat`)
- ✅ 4 real LLM CLIs: Gemini, Codex, Grok, Claude
- ✅ Boolean rate limit flags with pause mechanism
- ✅ Independent generation (no forced collaboration/divergence)
- ✅ Technical validation only (not strategic preferences)

**Key Innovation:**
- Fixed critical bug from v4-v7 where file paths were referenced but not included
- Now mirrors proven pattern from `run_filter_patterns_review.sh`
- LLMs receive ~6700+ lines of context including:
  - 23 filter patterns (FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.1)
  - 20+ motivation signals (LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md)
  - Complete filter list (AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md)
  - 86 preset examples (PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md)
  - Comprehensive strategy guide (PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md)

**Location:** `projects/MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v8/`

**Next Steps:** Complete Phase 0-2, then test in SearchLand

### 2. MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v3 (2025-11-19) ⚠️ ARCHIVED

**Requirements:**
- £2M profit from £200k capital (10x ROI)
- 8-storey mixed-use development opportunities (Class E + C3)
- High precision, 10-50 properties per approach

**Status:** Stage 1 - Divergent Generation (2/6 approaches complete)

**Approaches Generated:**
1. **Approach E (Claude):** Corporate Distress Combo - Liquidation + Lease Expiry
2. **Approach F (Claude):** Commercial Airspace Conversion - Flat roofs + 4-6 storeys addition

**Pending:**
- Gemini: 2 approaches (suggested: Stalled planning, EPC compliance)
- Codex: 2 approaches (suggested: Grey Belt, Strategic land)

**Key Innovations:**
- First combination of liquidation + lease expiry signals
- Airspace rights model (£80k-£150k vs freehold £500k+)
- Multiple property strategy within £200k budget
- Leverages v3.1 preset insights (86 presets analyzed)

**Location:** `projects/MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v3/`

**Next Steps:** Complete generation OR test existing 2 approaches empirically

## Completed Projects

### 1. MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v2 (2025-01-19) [ARCHIVED - v2 Methodology]

**Requirements:**
- £2M profit from £200k capital (10x ROI)
- 8-storey mixed-use development opportunities (Class E + C3)
- High precision, 10-50 properties per filter

**Iterations:** 3 (Converged)

**Final Filters:**
1. Tall Building Zone Option Agreements (10-20 properties expected)
2. Expired 8-Storey Planning + Market Motivation (5-12 properties expected)
3. Airspace-Ready Option Agreements (15-25 properties expected)

**Key Learnings (Design Phase):**
- Height calculations must match storey requirements (25m+ for 8 storeys)
- £200k requires option agreements, not direct purchase
- Policy support filters (tall building zones, PTAL, HDT) essential
- Motivation signals must be specific and searchable
- Minimum 2 iterations prevented major errors from reaching production

**Key Learnings (Implementation Phase):**
- **Pattern #6:** LLMs assume filters exist that don't (no "Expired planning status")
- **Pattern #7:** Prose format doesn't work - structured format does! (CRITICAL)
- Units are acres/sqft not sqmt/sqm (must convert)
- Tested diagnostic filter: 10 results in Slough ✅
- SearchLand AI parses structured format perfectly

**Convergence:** Achieved after 3 design iterations + 1 implementation iteration

**Status:** ✅ Implementation validated (10 real results) - **ARCHIVED (v2 methodology obsolete)**

**Location:** `projects/archive/MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v2-convergent-20251119/`

**Note:** This project used the old convergent methodology (v2). For current best practices, see v3 projects.

**Reference For:**
- Mixed-use residential + commercial projects
- Option agreement strategies
- Tall building/high-density searches
- Limited capital (<£500k) creative structuring
