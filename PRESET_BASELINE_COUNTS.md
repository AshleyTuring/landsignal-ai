## Summary Statistics

**Total Presets Documented:** 40+  
**Highest Count Preset:** Unsold homes with poor EPC (12,379 sites)  
**Zero Result Presets:** 3 (Care homes, Edge of settlement v2, Farmland nutrient neutrality)  
**Most Relevant for Demolish/Rebuild:** Run down homes (646), Class ZA (162), Unsold homes with poor EPC (12,379)

---

## Notes for Project

- **Run down homes** (646 sites) is likely the most directly relevant preset for demolish/rebuild strategy
- **Unsold homes with poor EPC** (12,379 sites) may contain motivated sellers but needs significant filtering
- **Class ZA** (162 sites) allows PD rebuild of commercial buildings - potential arbitrage angle
- Many presets show strong results (500+ sites), indicating healthy market across 17 LPAs
- Zero results on care homes and nutrient neutrality farmland suggest these strategies won't work in London boroughs
