# **APPROACH D: Airspace Development - Flat Roof Intensification**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (structural risk)  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace Development)  
**Capital Required:** £170,000-£195,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink]
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 750
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15
```

## **Rationale**

**Structural arbitrage:** Purchase airspace rights (20-40% of freehold value) vs full ownership.

Critical refinement: `Number of leaseholds: 0` eliminates #1 deal-killer (Pattern 23B from LEARNINGS_DATABASE).

⚠️ **WARNING:** 30-40% of sites fail structural survey (£10k-£15k sunk cost). Budget for multiple tests.

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Very low capital (£100k vs £500k freehold)
- ✅ Landowner keeps income (easier negotiation)
- ✅ Policy support (housing crisis, London Plan H2)
- ✅ Flat roof = lower costs (no reconstruction)
- ✅ Unbroken freehold = no leasehold negotiation

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** 30-40% fail structural survey (non-recoverable £10k-£15k)
- ⚠️ Party wall agreements (2-6 month delay)
- ⚠️ Fire regs (second staircase £80k-£150k)
- ⚠️ Construction disruption (limits contractors)
- ⚠️ Right to light claims (BRE guidelines strict)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-3:** Run filter (London, Reading, Slough, Brighton)
2. **Weeks 4-6:** Desktop screening (roof verification)
3. **Weeks 7-10:** Approach freeholders (profit-share: 30%/70%)
4. **Weeks 11-14:** Negotiate airspace (£80k-£120k, conditional on structural survey)
5. **Months 4-5:** **CRITICAL:** Structural survey (if fails, abort)
6. **Months 6-8:** If pass, architect design (4-5 storeys)
7. **Months 9-14:** Planning application
8. **Exit:** Sell airspace + consent £600k-£1M = **£400k-£850k profit**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Airspace purchase: £120,000
- Structural/Architectural/Planning Fees: £50,000
- **Total:** £170,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**

⚠️ **CONDITIONAL:** Only proceed if comfortable with 30-40% failure rate.
