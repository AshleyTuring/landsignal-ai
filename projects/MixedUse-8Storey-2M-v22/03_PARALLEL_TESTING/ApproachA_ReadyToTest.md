```

## **Rationale**

**ALL 4 LLMs CONVERGED** on this strategy - the strongest signal in the entire synthesis. The approved 8-storey mixed-use in Slough provides **proven planning precedent**, reducing risk from ~40% (speculative) to ~70-80% (proven pathway).

Key mechanics:
- Similar use classes (E + C3) = precedent match
- Low-rise (<4 floors) = intensification headroom
- Transport (<800m station) = density policy support (NPPF)
- Stalled planning (last app before 2022) = opportunity to revive
- Inactive buildings = no income = motivation
- On market + price capped = immediate availability

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Precedent = proven planning path in same authority
- ✅ Low capital via options (£50k-£150k vs £500k+ purchase)
- ✅ Transport proximity = NPPF compliance (Para 11, 120)
- ✅ Inactive + on market = double motivation
- ✅ Stalled planning = shows developer interest (previous attempts)
- ✅ 4/4 LLM consensus = strongest validation signal

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Why did planning stall? Must investigate refusal reasons
- ⚠️ Market listings = competitive (other buyers)
- ⚠️ £250k cap = may exclude larger/better sites
- ⚠️ "Inactive" filter restrictive
- ⚠️ 12-18 month planning timeline

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, desktop due diligence (Land Registry, planning portal)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Investigate why planning stalled (refusal reasons, expiry circumstances)
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Shortlist 10 sites, approach owners with option proposal
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate options (12-24 months, £10k-£50k, planning-contingent)
5. **Months 4-6:** Engage planners (£20k-£50k), pre-app citing precedent
6. **Months 7-18:** Submit application, manage process
7. **Months 19-20:** Market to housebuilders, assign option
8. **Exit:** Sell with consent £800k-£1.2M vs £200k land value

**Profit:** £50k option + £50k planning = £100k → sell £1M = **£900k profit × 2-3 deals = £1.8M-£2.7M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Option agreement: £10,000-£50,000
- Legal fees (option): £3,000-£8,000
- Planning consultant: £20,000-£50,000
- Planning application fees: £10,000-£30,000
- Ground investigation/surveys: £5,000-£15,000
- Contingency (10%): £5,000-£15,000
- **Total:** £53,000-£168,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**
