9. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

## **Rationale**

**Value-add conversion** targeting oversized C3 houses (>2000 sqft) with poor EPC. Exploits:
- Unbroken freehold = no leasehold friction (Pattern 23A - critical learning)
- Poor EPC = cannot rent (MEES), needs £20k-£40k = motivation
- Legacy ownership (sold before 2004) = tired landlord
- Stale planning = passive ownership
- **Yield arbitrage:** 3-bed BTL 3-4% → 6-8 bed HMO 6-9% (+150% income)

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Clean acquisition (single negotiation, no leaseholders)
- ✅ EPC pressure = discount motivation
- ✅ Clear HMO scale (>2000 sqft = 6-8 beds proven)
- ✅ Yield uplift 2-3× on same asset
- ✅ Planning risk lower (C3→C4 often permitted)
- ✅ Market liquidity (sell to investors or families)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Article 4 manual check (post-export)
- ⚠️ EPC F/G may = heavy capex (£30k-£50k)
- ⚠️ Floor area data gaps (Rightmove scrape needed)
- ⚠️ Amenity space standards vary
- ⚠️ Conversion costs £40k-£60k
- ⚠️ License saturation in some areas

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, cross-check Article 4 register
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Desktop screening (floor plans, room count viability)
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Approach owners ("EPC problem, needs £30k, we offer cash")
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate 10-20% discount
5. **Months 4-6:** Convert: EPC £20k-£30k, HMO fit-out £20k-£30k
6. **Months 7-8:** HMO license, rent (6-8 beds @ £600/month = £43k-£58k gross)
7. **Exit A:** Hold for 8% net × 5 years
8. **Exit B:** Flip to investor £310k (12 months)

**Profit:** £160k + £50k conversion = £210k → sell £310k = **£100k × 20 = £2M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Acquisition (25% deposit + fees): £80,000
- Conversion works + compliance: £55,000
- Professional fees (architect/MEP/fire): £10,000
- Licensing/EPC/contingency: £15,000
- **Total:** £160,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**
