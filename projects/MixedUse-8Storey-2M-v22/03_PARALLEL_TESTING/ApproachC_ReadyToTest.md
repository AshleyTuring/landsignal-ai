```

## **Rationale**

**INHERITED/LEGACY PROPERTIES** with patient, relationship-based sourcing:
- Never sold = inherited/very long hold (pre-digital Land Registry)
- Private owner = non-professional, may not know development value
- No planning activity = passive holding
- Development-scale (0.25-2 acres) = meaningful mixed-use projects
- Transport accessibility = supports 8-storey policy
- Under-developed (<40%) = land value play

**Behavioral Arbitrage:** Owners often don't know current value, have estate planning motivation, prefer to sell land vs develop.

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Off-market opportunities (no listing = no competition)
- ✅ Information advantage (you know development potential, owner doesn't)
- ✅ Patient capital (option agreements £10k-£50k)
- ✅ Relationship-based (build trust, win-win outcomes)
- ✅ Multiple exit routes (E/B2/B8/C3 all have conversion precedents)
- ✅ Urban context + transport = planning-friendly

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Time-intensive (relationship building takes 3-6 months per owner)
- ⚠️ Low volume (may only yield 10-30 leads, not all convert)
- ⚠️ Owner hard to locate (pre-digital records, contact info outdated)
- ⚠️ Emotional attachment (family holdings may have sentimental value)
- ⚠️ Planning risk (no recent applications = no validated planning potential)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Months 1-2:** Run filter, Land Registry title search (£7/title)
2. **Months 2-4:** Personalized letters + follow-up calls
3. **Months 3-6:** Meet owners, build trust, educate on development potential
4. **Months 6-12:** Negotiate option terms (£10k-£50k, 18-24 months, planning-contingent)
5. **Months 12-30:** Apply for planning (8-storey mixed-use, residential conversion)
6. **Exit A:** Sell option to developer (£100k-£500k profit, fast)
7. **Exit B:** Exercise option, sell with planning (£1M-£3M+ profit, slower)

**Profit:** £30k option + £50k planning = £80k → sell £1.5M = **£1.42M × 1-2 deals = £1.42M-£2.84M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Land Registry searches: £2,000-£3,000 (300 titles)
- Planning consultant (pre-app): £10,000-£20,000
- Option fee (per site): £10,000-£50,000
- Legal fees (option agreement): £5,000-£10,000
- Outreach/marketing: £2,000-£5,000
- Contingency (10%): £3,000-£9,000
- **Total per site:** £32,000-£97,000
- **Portfolio (2-3 sites):** £64,000-£194,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**
