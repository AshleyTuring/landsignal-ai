# **APPROACH E: Derelict Turnaround - Low-Capital Volume Play**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 4C (Derelict Asset Turnaround)  
**Capital Required:** £120,000-£160,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
7. Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
8. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
9. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
```

## **Rationale**

**Distressed assets** with motivated sellers. Exploits:
- Derelict status = compliance pressure (asset write-down)
- Low entry capital (<£150k) allows multiple acquisitions
- Transport proximity = exit viability for residential
- Long hold (sold before 2010) = tired landlord
- No planning activity = passive holding

**Volume strategy:** Buy £100k, rebuild £100k, sell £300k each × multiple deals = £2M target

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Low entry capital allows multiple acquisitions within £200k
- ✅ Derelict status = strong seller motivation
- ✅ Transport proximity ensures exit viability
- ✅ Broad UK scope increases opportunity pool
- ✅ Unconstrained sites (>80%) = planning-friendly

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Hidden structural issues requiring additional costs
- ⚠️ Planning for rebuild may face local opposition
- ⚠️ Smaller plot sizes limit profit per deal (requires volume)
- ⚠️ Competition from other distressed asset buyers

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter across UK, prioritize near train stations
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Site visits to assess rebuild potential
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Negotiate direct purchases (£5k-£10k options)
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Secure planning for residential rebuild
5. **Months 4-12:** Execute demolish/rebuild in phases
6. **Exit:** Sell completed units for profit
7. **Scale:** Repeat across multiple sites for cumulative £2M target

**Profit:** £100k acquisition + £30k demolish/setup = £130k → sell £200k = **£70k × 15-20 deals = £1.05M-£1.4M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Acquisition costs (multiple sites at £50k-£100k each): £100,000
- Demolition and initial rebuild setup: £30,000
- Planning and legal fees: £15,000
- Due diligence and surveys: £10,000
- Contingency for repairs: £5,000
- **Total:** £160,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **Validation Summary**

✅ **FULLY VALID (Test Immediately):**
- Approach A: Precedent Replication (4/4 LLM consensus - STRONGEST SIGNAL)
- Approach B: HMO Conversion
- Approach C: Legacy Holdings
- Approach E: Derelict Turnaround

⚠️ **CONDITIONAL:**
- Approach D: Airspace (30-40% structural failure, budget multiple surveys)

❌ **EXCLUDED:**
- Claude-B: Liquidation (5-20 results too limited)
- Claude-D: High-PTAL (requires £225k+ or JV partner)
- Codex-C: Brand Covenant (lease timing complexity)
- Gemini-C: EPC Arbitrage (lower profit per deal, requires volume)

---

### **Recommended Testing Sequence**

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Highest Probability**
1. **Approach A** (Precedent) - 4/4 LLM consensus = strongest signal
2. **Approach B** (HMO Conversion) - clear value-add

**Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Capital-Efficient**
3. **Approach C** (Legacy Holdings) - patient capital, off-market
4. **Approach E** (Derelict Turnaround) - volume play

**Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Conditional**
5. **Approach D** (Airspace) - only if comfortable with failure rate

---

### **Key Learnings**

**Convergence Insights:**
- **4/4 LLMs** → Precedent replication = strongest signal
- **Pattern 23A** → Unbroken freehold critical (appears in 3 approaches)
- **Transport accessibility** → <800m-1000m train station universal

**Critical Refinements:**
- Pattern 23A: `Number of leaseholds: 0` prevents #1 airspace killer
- Article 4: Manual check post-export (HMO approaches)
- Structural contingency: £10k-£15k for airspace failures
- Stalled planning: Investigate refusal reasons before proceeding

**Diversity Preserved:** 5 distinct strategies (not forced convergence)
