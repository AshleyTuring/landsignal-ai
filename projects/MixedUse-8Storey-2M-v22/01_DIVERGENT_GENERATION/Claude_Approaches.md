Based on my comprehensive analysis of your requirements, reference materials, and strategic patterns, I'll generate **4 unique property search strategies** that cover:

1. **Precedent-based** approaches (replicating the Slough 8-storey mixed-use approval)
2. **Motivation-driven** approaches (behavioral arbitrage)
3. **Capital-efficient** structures (within £200k budget)
4. **Strategic diversity** across multiple angles

---

## Approach A: Slough Precedent Replication - Stalled Mixed-Use with Height Approval

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A (Expired/Stalled Planning) + Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreement or distressed purchase)  
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties (highly targeted)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial" OR "Class E"
3. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
4. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
8. Building on title is inactive: Yes
9. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
10. Sales listing price: is less than 250000
```

### Rationale:

This approach **replicates the Slough precedent** by finding sites with:
- **Similar planning history:** Previous mixed-use proposals with multiple storeys (filters 1-2)
- **Current under-development:** <4 floors existing = intensification potential (filter 3)
- **Stalled planning:** Last application 2+ years ago, <3 apps in 5 years (filters 4-5)
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m train station supports density policy (filter 6)
- **Appropriate size:** 0.15-1.5 acres = 6,500-65,000 sqft (similar to Slough site) (filter 7)
- **Inactive buildings:** Derelict/unused = motivated seller signal (filter 8)
- **Active listings:** On market + price capped at £250k (filters 9-10)

**Planning Precedent Logic:**  
The Slough approval demonstrates that 8-storey mixed-use (retail ground floor + residential above) is achievable in transport-accessible locations. This filter finds similar sites where:
- Planning was previously attempted (demonstrates developer interest)
- Applications have stalled (opportunity for you to revive)
- Current low-rise = intensification upside
- Listed for sale = motivated seller

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Proven precedent:** 8-storey mixed-use approved in Slough = replicable
- ✅ **Planning de-risked:** Similar proposals already attempted (shows viability)
- ✅ **Motivated sellers:** Stalled planning + inactive building + on market
- ✅ **Transport policy support:** <800m train = density-friendly planning context
- ✅ **Capital-efficient:** £50k-£250k acquisition, option agreements possible
- ✅ **High profit potential:** Low-rise to 8-storey = 4-6x floor area increase

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Why did planning stall?** Must investigate refusal reasons (if applicable)
- ⚠️ **Market listings = competitive:** Other buyers may be circling
- ⚠️ **£250k cap = limited pool:** May exclude larger/better sites
- ⚠️ **"Inactive" filter restrictive:** Could miss occupied buildings with potential
- ⚠️ **Transport dependency:** <800m train station excludes some viable sites

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Site Identification (Week 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Review each property's planning history on Local Planning Authority (LPA) website
3. Identify refusal reasons (if refused) or expiry circumstances (if lapsed)
4. Shortlist sites where planning failure was addressable (design, affordable housing %, etc.)

**Phase 2: Precedent Research (Week 2-3)**
5. For each shortlisted site, search LPA for similar approved schemes within 500m
6. Document precedents: height approved, unit mix, density, S106 obligations
7. Assess policy context: Is LPA pro-growth? Housing delivery test failed? (motivation to approve)

**Phase 3: Owner Outreach (Week 3-4)**
8. Contact owners directly (Land Registry title search for details)
9. Approach: "I've identified planning potential on your site. Would you consider an option agreement?"
10. Negotiate option: £10k-£50k fee, 12-24 month term, planning-contingent

**Phase 4: Planning Strategy (Month 2-12)**
11. Engage planning consultant (£20k-£50k for pre-app + submission)
12. Pre-application advice from LPA (de-risk before formal submission)
13. Address previous refusal reasons (if applicable)
14. Submit planning application (£10k-£30k fees depending on size)

**Phase 5: Exit (Month 12-18)**
15. **Option 1 - Sell with planning:** Exit to housebuilder at 40-50% of GDV (£2M+ profit if successful)
16. **Option 2 - Sell option:** Sell option to developer for £100k-£500k (lower profit, faster exit)
17. **Option 3 - JV with housebuilder:** Contribute land, they fund build, split profit 30/70

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Site option agreement:** £10k-£50k
- **Legal fees (option):** £3k-£8k
- **Planning consultant:** £20k-£50k
- **Planning application fees:** £10k-£30k
- **Ground investigation/surveys:** £5k-£15k
- **Contingency (10%):** £5k-£15k
- **Total:** £53k-£168k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit:

- **Scenario 1 (Slough replication):** 8-storey, 40 units, £400k/unit GDV = £16M GDV
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,000/sqm × 3,000sqm) = £6M
- **Less:** S106/CIL = £2M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £1M
- **Residual land value:** £7M
- **Your profit (if sell with planning at 50% RLV):** £3.5M
- **Less your costs:** £168k
- **Net profit:** £3.3M ✅ **Exceeds £2M target**

## Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales with Development Potential

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales) + Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (distressed pricing + legal)  
**Expected Results:** 5-20 properties (very targeted, high motivation)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 5
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, Outside of the defined classes]
6. Building on title is derelict: Yes
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **FORCED SELLERS** - companies in liquidation with development-potential assets:

- **Liquidation = maximum motivation:** Legal obligation to sell (filter 1-2)
- **Developable size:** 0.2-5 acres = 8,700-217,800 sqft (meaningful projects) (filter 3)
- **Transport accessibility:** <1km train supports residential conversion/mixed-use (filter 4)
- **Commercial/industrial use:** E/B2/B8/Sui Generis = conversion opportunities (filter 5)
- **Derelict buildings:** Double motivation (cannot generate income) (filter 6)
- **Clean planning:** Excludes major blockers (filter 7)
- **70%+ unconstrained:** Developable land (filter 8)

**Behavioral Economics Logic:**  
Liquidators are motivated by:
1. **Speed:** Must complete sales quickly (creditor pressure)
2. **Certainty:** Cash buyers preferred (no financing contingencies)
3. **Below-market pricing:** Discounts of 20-40% common in forced sales
4. **Clear decision-maker:** Liquidator has authority (no emotional attachment)

This creates a **buyer's market** where you have negotiating leverage.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **VERY strong motivation:** Forced sale = legal obligation
- ✅ **Below-market pricing:** Liquidation sales typically 20-40% discount
- ✅ **Speed advantage:** Liquidators prioritize fast completion
- ✅ **Clear decision-maker:** No emotional attachment, professional seller
- ✅ **Conversion opportunities:** Commercial/industrial → residential/mixed-use
- ✅ **Double motivation:** Liquidation + derelict = maximum urgency
- ✅ **Low competition:** Many buyers avoid liquidation complexity

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Very limited pool:** Liquidations are rare (5-20 results expected)
- ⚠️ **Legal complexity:** May have creditor claims, liens, environmental liabilities
- ⚠️ **Unknown condition:** Derelict buildings may have structural issues
- ⚠️ **Timeline pressure:** Liquidator may accept first reasonable offer (act fast)
- ⚠️ **Planning uncertainty:** Conversion not guaranteed (especially B2/B8 in some LPAs)

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Rapid Response (Week 1)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Identify liquidator contact (Companies House, Land Registry)
3. **Same-day outreach:** Call liquidator within 24 hours of discovery
4. Position: "Cash buyer, 4-week completion, no financing contingency"

**Phase 2: Due Diligence (Week 1-3)**
5. Fast-track title search (Land Registry - £7, 24hr turnaround)
6. Desktop environmental assessment (Phase 1 - £2k-£5k)
7. Review creditor claims (Companies House records)
8. Structural survey (derelict buildings - £3k-£8k)
9. Planning pre-app (informal discussion with LPA - £0-£1k)

**Phase 3: Negotiation (Week 2-4)**
10. Offer 60-70% of market value (liquidator will negotiate)
11. Highlight: Speed, certainty, cash, no contingencies
12. Lock in exclusivity (7-14 days) with £5k-£10k deposit
13. Agree 4-6 week completion (faster = better price)

**Phase 4: Acquisition (Week 4-6)**
14. Exchange contracts (solicitor fees £5k-£10k)
15. Complete purchase (cash payment or bridging finance)
16. Secure site (insurance, security, make safe)

**Phase 5: Exit (Month 3-18)**
17. **Option 1 - Quick flip:** Sell to developer immediately (10-30% profit, 3-6 months)
18. **Option 2 - Planning gain:** Apply for planning, sell with consent (50-100% profit, 12-18 months)
19. **Option 3 - JV:** Partner with developer (land contribution, they build, split profit)

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Site acquisition:** £80k-£120k (distressed pricing)
- **Legal fees:** £5k-£10k
- **Due diligence:** £8k-£15k (surveys, environmental, title)
- **Make safe/security:** £2k-£5k
- **Planning pre-app/advice:** £5k-£10k
- **Contingency (10%):** £10k-£16k
- **Total:** £110k-£176k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit:

**Scenario 1: Quick flip (no planning)**
- Acquisition: £100k (below market)
- Market value (as-is): £150k
- Sell to developer: £130k-£140k
- Net profit: £20k-£30k (3-6 months)
- **ROI:** 20-30% in <6 months ⚠️ Below £2M target but fast capital recycling

**Scenario 2: Planning gain (residential conversion)**
- Acquisition: £100k
- Planning costs: £30k-£60k
- Market value with consent: £500k-£1M (depending on units approved)
- Sell at 70% of market: £350k-£700k
- Less costs: £130k-£160k
- Net profit: £220k-£570k (12-18 months)
- **ROI:** 140-360% ⚠️ Still below £2M target but excellent return

**Scenario 3: Portfolio strategy (multiple sites)**
- Repeat process 3-5 times with £200k capital (recycled)
- Average profit per site: £200k-£400k
- Total profit (3-5 sites over 18-24 months): £600k-£2M ✅ **Can hit £2M target with volume**

## Approach C: Legacy Holdings Conversion - Off-Market Mixed-Use Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings) + Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + Accessibility)  
**Capital Required:** £10k-£50k (option agreements, patient capital)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (relationship-based sourcing)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. No latest sold date
2. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
3. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
7. Developed area percentage: is less than 40
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Built up areas
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **INHERITED/LEGACY PROPERTIES** with patient, relationship-based sourcing:

- **Never sold:** No Land Registry sale record = inherited/very long hold (filter 1)
- **Private owner:** Non-professional, may not know development value (filter 2)
- **No planning activity:** <1 app in 5 years = passive holding (filter 3)
- **Development-scale:** 0.25-2 acres = meaningful mixed-use projects (filter 4)
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m train = supports 8-storey policy (filter 5)
- **Flexible use:** E/B2/B8/C3 = multiple conversion routes (filter 6)
- **Under-developed:** <40% developed = land value play (filter 7)
- **Clean planning:** Excludes major constraints (filter 8)
- **Urban context:** Built-up areas = residential policy support (filter 9)

**Behavioral Arbitrage Logic:**  
Owners of never-sold properties often:
1. **Don't know current value:** Inherited decades ago, no recent valuation
2. **Estate planning motivation:** Elderly owners looking to liquidate
3. **Tax liability concerns:** CGT on development gain, prefer to sell land
4. **Non-professional:** Not developers, don't understand planning potential
5. **Off-market:** Not actively marketed (no agent competition)

This creates **information asymmetry** - you know the development potential, they don't.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Off-market opportunities:** No listing = no competition
- ✅ **Information advantage:** You know development potential, owner doesn't
- ✅ **Patient capital:** Low upfront cost (option agreements £10k-£50k)
- ✅ **Relationship-based:** Build trust, win-win outcomes (fair price for owner, upside for you)
- ✅ **Multiple exit routes:** E/B2/B8/C3 all have conversion precedents
- ✅ **Urban context:** Built-up areas + transport = planning-friendly
- ✅ **No active developers:** 0 apps in 5 years = no competition from other developers

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Time-intensive:** Relationship building takes 3-6 months per owner
- ⚠️ **Low volume:** May only yield 10-30 leads, not all convert
- ⚠️ **Owner hard to locate:** "No sold date" = pre-digital records, contact info may be outdated
- ⚠️ **Emotional attachment:** Family holdings may have sentimental value (resistance to sell)
- ⚠️ **Planning risk:** No recent applications = no validated planning potential

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Targeted Sourcing (Month 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Land Registry title search for owner details (£7/title, 300 titles = £2,100)
3. Cross-reference with Electoral Roll, Companies House (find contact info)
4. Create property dossiers: photos, planning policy analysis, precedent research

**Phase 2: Outreach Campaign (Month 2-4)**
5. **Personalized letters:** Not generic direct mail - reference specific property, local precedents
6. Follow-up calls (2-3 weeks after letter)
7. **Value proposition:** "I specialize in helping landowners unlock planning potential. Would you consider an option agreement where I fund planning, you retain ownership, we share upside?"
8. **Education:** Explain development potential, show comparable sales, demonstrate value

**Phase 3: Relationship Building (Month 3-6)**
9. Meet owners in person (site visits, coffee meetings)
10. Build trust: Professional, transparent, fair
11. Address concerns: "You keep ownership, no risk, I fund planning, we split profit 40/60"
12. Introduce to planning consultant (credibility)

**Phase 4: Option Agreements (Month 6-12)**
13. Negotiate option terms:
    - Option fee: £10k-£50k (non-refundable, against purchase price)
    - Term: 18-24 months (time to secure planning)
    - Strike price: £500k-£2M (fair market value for current use)
    - Overage: 30-40% of uplift (planning gain split)
14. Legal documentation (solicitor £5k-£10k)
15. Exercise conditions: Planning consent granted

**Phase 5: Planning & Exit (Month 12-30)**
16. Apply for planning (8-storey mixed-use, residential conversion, etc.)
17. **Exit Option 1:** Sell option to developer (£100k-£500k profit, fast)
18. **Exit Option 2:** Exercise option, sell with planning (£1M-£3M+ profit, slower)
19. **Exit Option 3:** JV with developer (land + planning, split build profit)

### Capital Breakdown (Per Site):

- **Land Registry searches:** £2k-£3k (300 titles)
- **Planning consultant (pre-app):** £10k-£20k
- **Option fee (per site):** £10k-£50k
- **Legal fees (option agreement):** £5k-£10k
- **Outreach/marketing:** £2k-£5k (letters, calls, site visits)
- **Contingency (10%):** £3k-£9k
- **Total per site:** £32k-£97k
- **Portfolio (2-3 sites):** £64k-£194k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit (Per Site):

**Scenario 1: Sell option (no planning)**
- Option fee invested: £30k
- Sell option to developer: £100k-£300k
- Net profit: £70k-£270k (12-18 months)
- **ROI:** 230-900% per site

**Scenario 2: Exercise option + sell with planning**
- Option fee: £30k
- Planning costs: £50k-£80k
- Strike price: £1M (pay owner)
- Market value with planning: £3M-£5M (8-storey mixed-use)
- Sell at 60% of market: £1.8M-£3M
- Less costs: £1.08M-£1.11M
- Net profit: £690k-£1.89M (24-36 months)
- **ROI:** 638-1,750% per site ✅ **Single site can hit £2M target**

**Scenario 3: Portfolio (3 sites)**
- Average profit per site (sell options): £150k
- Total profit (3 sites): £450k (18-24 months)
- **Plus:** 1 site with planning exercise: +£1.5M
- **Total portfolio profit:** £1.95M ✅ **Close to £2M target**

## Approach D: High-PTAL Low-Rise Intensification - London Tall Building Zones

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) + Pattern 3A (Development Opportunity)  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£200k (deposit/option for higher-value sites)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (London-focused, policy-supported)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
2. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.2
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, C3 - Dwellinghouses, Outside of the defined classes]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Green Belt]
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
7. Developed area percentage: is greater than 20 AND less than 60
8. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
9. Sales listing price: is less than 2000000
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **TALL BUILDING POLICY SUPPORT** in London's highest-accessibility zones:

- **Excellent transport:** PTAL 5-6b = London's best-connected areas (filter 1)
- **Low-rise existing:** <4 floors = intensification opportunity (filter 2)
- **Development-scale:** 0.15-1.2 acres = 6,500-52,000 sqft (suitable for 8-storey) (filter 3)
- **Flexible use:** E/B2/B8/C3/Sui Generis = multiple routes to residential (filter 4)
- **Clean heritage:** No conservation/listed constraints (filter 5)
- **75%+ unconstrained:** Developable (filter 6)
- **Partially developed:** 20-60% = existing use (income during planning) but land for intensification (filter 7)
- **Active market:** On-market listings (filter 8)
- **Capital-efficient:** <£2M price (deposit £200k + debt financing) (filter 9)

**Planning Policy Logic:**  
London's tall building policies (London Plan 2021) explicitly support height in:
- **PTAL 4-6:** High transport accessibility
- **Opportunity Areas:** Designated growth zones
- **Town centres:** Commercial intensification

This filter finds **policy-backed intensification opportunities** where 8-storey is defensible.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Planning policy support:** PTAL 5-6b = tall building policy zones
- ✅ **London precedents:** Many 8-storey+ approvals in PTAL 5-6b areas
- ✅ **Existing use value:** 20-60% developed = income during planning (reduces hold cost)
- ✅ **Multiple conversion routes:** E/B2/B8/C3 all viable in London
- ✅ **Higher land values:** London = higher residual values (supports £2M profit target)
- ✅ **Active market:** On-market listings = immediate availability
- ✅ **Clean title:** 75%+ unconstrained = fewer planning obstacles

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **London-specific:** PTAL only in TfL area (excludes rest of UK)
- ⚠️ **Higher acquisition cost:** £1M-£2M price requires debt (£200k deposit + £1.8M loan)
- ⚠️ **Competition:** On-market listings = other buyers bidding
- ⚠️ **Planning risk:** Tall building policies have local opposition risk
- ⚠️ **S106/CIL costs:** London = high affordable housing % (35-50%) and CIL

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Site Filtering (Week 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Overlay with London Plan Opportunity Areas map (GLA website)
3. Prioritize sites in:
   - Opportunity Areas (growth zones)
   - Town centres (commercial intensification)
   - Areas with recent 8-storey+ approvals (precedent)
4. Shortlist 10-15 sites with strongest planning case

**Phase 2: Planning Viability (Week 2-4)**
5. Review local plan policies (each London borough has tall building policy)
6. Search planning portal for nearby precedents (8-storey+ approvals within 500m)
7. Assess precedent quality:
   - Similar height? ✅
   - Similar use (mixed-use)? ✅
   - Recent approval (last 3 years)? ✅
   - Consistent with local policy? ✅
8. Desktop viability assessment (£20k-£40k planning consultant)

**Phase 3: Financing (Week 3-6)**
9. Approach development finance brokers (bridging loan + planning exit)
10. Structure: £200k equity + £1.8M debt (max £2M acquisition)
11. Debt terms: 18-24 month bridge, 1-2% monthly interest, planning exit refinance
12. Pre-approval (conditional on site acquisition)

**Phase 4: Acquisition (Month 2-3)**
13. Make offer (£1.5M-£1.8M, allowing £200k buffer for costs)
14. Due diligence: Title, surveys, planning pre-app (£15k-£30k)
15. Exchange with 10% deposit (£150k-£180k)
16. Complete with debt drawdown

**Phase 5: Planning (Month 3-18)**
17. Engage London planning specialist (£40k-£80k full service)
18. Pre-application with LPA (£5k-£10k fee, 2-3 meetings)
19. Design: 8-storey mixed-use, ground floor retail/E, upper floors residential
20. Target: 30-50 units (depending on site size)
21. S106 negotiation: Affordable housing %, CIL, public realm
22. Submit application (£20k-£50k fee)
23. Target approval: 12-15 months

**Phase 6: Exit (Month 15-24)**
24. **Exit Option 1:** Sell with planning to housebuilder (40-50% RLV)
25. **Exit Option 2:** JV with housebuilder (30% land, 70% build profit split)
26. **Exit Option 3:** Forward-fund with pension fund (pre-let, they fund build, fixed land payment)

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Deposit (10%):** £150k-£180k
- **Legal/surveys/due diligence:** £15k-£30k
- **Planning consultant:** £40k-£80k (spread over 12-18 months)
- **Planning fees:** £20k-£50k
- **Interest on debt (18 months @ 1.5%/month):** £486k-£583k (rolled into debt, paid at exit)
- **Total equity required:** £225k ⚠️ **Slightly over £200k budget** (can reduce by negotiating lower acquisition or using JV partner equity)

**Adjusted Capital Strategy (To Stay Within £200k):**
- Reduce acquisition target to £1.5M (£150k deposit)
- Co-invest with planning partner (50/50 equity split = £112.5k deposit)
- **Total your equity:** £112.5k deposit + £40k planning share = £152.5k ✅ **Within £200k**

### Expected Profit:

**Scenario 1: 8-storey mixed-use (40 units)**
- **GDV:** £500k/unit × 40 units = £20M
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,500/sqm × 4,000sqm) = £10M
- **Less:** S106/CIL (40% affordable + £2M CIL) = £4M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £1.5M
- **Residual land value:** £4.5M
- **Sell at 50% RLV:** £2.25M
- **Less:** Acquisition + debt repayment = £2M + £0.5M interest = £2.5M
- **Your profit (50% equity share):** (£2.25M - £2.5M) × 50% = -£125k ⚠️ **Loss scenario** (conservative)

**Scenario 2: Optimistic (50 units, lower build cost)**
- **GDV:** £500k/unit × 50 units = £25M
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,200/sqm × 5,000sqm) = £11M
- **Less:** S106/CIL = £5M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £2M
- **Residual land value:** £7M
- **Sell at 50% RLV:** £3.5M
- **Less:** Acquisition + debt repayment = £2.5M
- **Your profit (50% equity share):** (£3.5M - £2.5M) × 50% = £500k ✅ **Profitable but below £2M target**

**Scenario 3: Portfolio (3 sites over 3 years)**
- Average profit per site: £500k
- Total profit: £1.5M (36 months)
- **Close to £2M target but requires recycling capital**

**Critical Issue with This Approach:**  
The profit margins are tight due to:
- High London land values
- High S106/CIL obligations (35-50% affordable housing)
- High build costs (£2,000-£2,500/sqm)

**This approach requires higher capital** than £200k to be viable, OR **a JV partner to share equity**.

| **A: Precedent Replication** | £53k-£168k | 12-18m | £2M-£3.5M | Medium | ✅ **Excellent** |
| **B: Liquidation Arbitrage** | £110k-£176k | 12-18m (portfolio) | £600k-£2M (volume) | Medium-High | ✅ **Good** (requires volume) |
| **C: Legacy Holdings** | £64k-£194k | 24-36m | £690k-£1.9M/site | Medium | ✅ **Excellent** (patient capital) |
| **D: High-PTAL Intensification** | £225k+ (or £152.5k with partner) | 15-24m | £500k-£1M/site | High | ⚠️ **Marginal** (needs JV partner) |

### My Recommendation: **Approach A + Approach C in Parallel**

**Why:**

1. **Approach A (Precedent Replication):**
   - Best fit for £200k capital (£53k-£168k)
   - Directly targets Slough precedent (8-storey mixed-use)
   - Highest profit potential (£2M-£3.5M per site)
   - 12-18 month timeline (reasonable)
   - Medium risk (planning precedent reduces uncertainty)

2. **Approach C (Legacy Holdings):**
   - Complementary strategy (relationship-based, off-market)
   - Low upfront capital (£10k-£50k per option)
   - Can pursue 2-3 sites in parallel
   - Longer timeline (24-36m) but very high ROI (£690k-£1.9M per site)
   - Builds pipeline for future projects

**Combined Strategy:**
- **Year 1:** Launch both approaches simultaneously
  - **Approach A:** Shortlist 5-10 stalled mixed-use sites, secure 1-2 options (£100k capital)
  - **Approach C:** Outreach to 50-100 legacy holdings, secure 2-3 options (£100k capital)
  - **Total capital deployed:** £200k
  
- **Year 2:** Execute planning on Approach A sites (fastest to market)
  - Exit 1 site with planning: **£2M-£3.5M profit** ✅ **Hits target**
  
- **Year 2-3:** Continue Approach C (longer-term, off-market plays)
  - Exit 1-2 sites with planning/options: **£1M-£2M additional profit**
  - **Total portfolio profit (3 years):** £3M-£5.5M

**Why NOT Approach B or D:**
- **Approach B (Liquidation):** Excellent strategy but very limited supply (5-20 sites) + requires volume to hit £2M (3-5 transactions)
- **Approach D (High-PTAL London):** Requires higher capital (£225k+ or JV partner) + tight profit margins due to London costs

Would you like me to:
1. **Refine any of these approaches** based on your feedback?
2. **Generate additional approaches** using different strategic patterns?
3. **Create a detailed action plan** for implementing Approaches A + C?
4. **Run additional analysis** on specific geographies or alternative strategies?
