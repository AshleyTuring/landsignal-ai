## Approach A: Slough Mid-Rise Intensification (Precedent Match)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £180k (option + DD + planning)  
**Expected Results:** 12-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local planning authority: is equal to Slough
2. Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Property type: is one of [Mixed Use, Commercial]
4. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Max building height (m): is less than 12
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
9. Building on title is inactive: Yes
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
11. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Green Belt]
```

**Rationale:**
Targets Slough titles with existing E/C3 mix but sub-12m height and inactivity, matching the approved 8-storey mixed-use precedent. High-access sites within 800m of rail mirror Slough centre transport context. Unbroken freeholds remove assembly risk (Pattern 23A), while low app count surfaces fresh stock.

**Strengths:**
- Direct geographic precedent alignment (Slough + mixed-use + under-height)
- Single freehold simplifies negotiation and airspace/intensification
- Inactivity and low app count flag dormant value
- Rail proximity strengthens tall-building policy support
- Tight size band calibrated for 8-storey massing

**Limitations:**
- Slough-only may constrain volume
- Some mixed-use titles may already be income-productive (harder to buy)
- Station-proximate stock can price high
- Inactivity flag can include structurally poor assets
- Exclusion of constraints may miss viable conservation-edge plays

**Implementation Strategy:**
Sequence titles by station distance and roof condition; walk-by for roof/structure viability. Lead with option/subject-to-planning; anchor price to vacant value. Commission massing test + pre-app citing nearby 8-storey approval; emphasize uplift from sub-12m baseline. If retail leases exist, negotiate surrender aligned to planning grant.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Site option fee: £60k  
- Planning + pre-app + surveys: £45k  
- Legal + option structuring: £20k  
- Technical (massing, transport, utilities): £25k  
- Contingency: £30k  
- **Total:** £180k (≤£200k)


## Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (High Yield, Low Capital)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 22A: HMO Conversion + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £160k (deposit + works)  
**Expected Results:** 25-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is equal to Residential
2. Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
6. Sales listing price: is less than 300000
7. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
8. Latest sold date: is less than 2004
9. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
10. Article 4 Direction: does not contain [C4/HMO]
11. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:**
Targets large, legacy-held freehold houses (>2,000 sqft) under £300k with poor EPC and no HMO Article 4, ideal for high-yield conversion. Unbroken titles avoid leasehold complications; low planning activity and old sale dates signal disengaged owners.

**Strengths:**
- High margin uplift (5-8% HMO vs 3-4% BTL)
- Low entry price fits £200k capital with leverage
- EPC E-G enables price negotiation + grant leverage
- No Article 4 reduces change-of-use risk
- Legacy ownership improves off-market receptivity

**Limitations:**
- Article 4 coverage must be double-checked manually
- EPC upgrades add cost/time
- Some assets may need significant capex to HMO standards
- Valuers may downvalue in weaker rental micro-markets
- Planning/classification nuances if sui generis scale pursued

**Implementation Strategy:**
Target secondary towns with strong student/professional demand; validate no Article 4 at LPA level. Offer quick close; structure with bridge-to-term. Execute EPC uplift and internal replan to 6-8 beds; certify fire safety and licensing early.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- 25% deposit + fees on £280k buy: £80k  
- Conversion works + compliance: £55k  
- Professional fees (architect/MEP/fire): £10k  
- Licensing/EPC/contingency: £15k  
- **Total:** £160k (≤£200k)


## Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry Reposition (QSR/Retail to Mixed Use)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 20A: Brand Covenant Expiry + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £190k (option + DD)  
**Expected Results:** 10-20 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is one of [Commercial, Mixed Use]
2. Use class: contains any [E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, E(b) - Food and drink]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Lease end date (year): is less than 2027
6. Average daily footfall: is greater than 6000
7. Max building height (m): is less than 12
8. Title area (sqft): is greater than 7000 AND less than 30000
9. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed building]
```

**Rationale:**
Focuses on high-footfall QSR/retail sites with leases expiring before 2027, enabling surrender/regear and reposition to mixed-use/resi. Sub-12m height and sizable plots support upward/airspace development; unbroken freeholds avoid headlease friction.

**Strengths:**
- Imminent lease expiry creates motivated landlords/tenants
- Footfall validates future commercial at ground floor
- Under-height stock ripe for airspace intensification
- Single freehold simplifies redevelopment timing
- Low planning history indicates untouched uplift

**Limitations:**
- Lease events may already be in negotiation
- Some brands hold renewal rights; surrender costs possible
- High-footfall sites can command strong residual values
- Constraint exclusions may miss edge-case heritage wins
- Footfall data needs on-the-ground validation

**Implementation Strategy:**
Rank by lease end proximity and footfall. Engage landlord and tenant for tri-party: offer surrender plus profit-share on new scheme. Run feasibility on 4-8 resi units above retained/reshaped ground floor. Structure via option/AGM with overage; secure pre-app early to evidence planning support.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/premium to control site: £70k  
- Planning/design/transport/noise studies: £50k  
- Legal + lease surrender negotiation: £35k  
- Contingency (early surveys/rights of light): £35k  
- **Total:** £190k (≤£200k)
