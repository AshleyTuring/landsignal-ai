### Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone (FILTER_PATTERNS.md - High-Density/Intensification Strategies)

**Capital Required:** £150,000-£180,000 (within £200k limit)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (narrow focus on Slough and nearby areas with similar development potential)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
2. Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
10. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets properties similar to the approved Slough 8-storey mixed-use development by focusing on sites with existing mixed-use (E and C3) potential, low-rise buildings in high-accessibility areas (PTAL 4+ or near train stations), and minimal planning constraints. The precedent shows successful approval for tall mixed-use in Slough, so we replicate by finding comparable sites with stalled or no recent planning activity, allowing us to apply for similar schemes. Capital is kept low by targeting smaller plots (0.5-2 acres) suitable for phased development, aiming for £2M profit through planning uplift and resale.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching to the Slough approval, increasing planning success likelihood
- High-density potential in transport-accessible areas, aligning with local policy support
- Narrow geographic focus reduces competition and improves result quality
- Combines multiple signals (use class, height, accessibility) for precise targeting

**Limitations:**
- PTAL limited to London/TfL areas; may need to substitute with train station proximity for non-London
- Requires local planning expertise to adapt the Slough precedent
- Smaller plot sizes may limit scale compared to the 8-storey target
- Dependent on market demand for mixed-use in similar locations

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run the filter to identify 10-30 sites in Slough and nearby (e.g., within 5-10 miles).
2. Manually review planning history for each site to confirm no recent tall building applications.
3. Approach owners with the Slough precedent as proof of viability, offering option agreements (£10k-£20k) to secure sites.
4. Engage a planning consultant to prepare applications mirroring the approved scheme.
5. Phase development: Secure planning first, then sell to housebuilder or developer for profit realization.
6. Monitor for fresh planning approvals in the area to refine targeting.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option agreements and legal fees: £20,000
- Planning application and consultant fees: £50,000
- Site surveys and due diligence: £10,000
- Marketing and negotiation costs: £10,000
- Contingency buffer: £10,000
- **Total:** £100,000 (well within £200k, allowing for phased capital deployment)

### Approach B: Low-Capital Derelict Turnaround

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4C: Derelict Asset Turnaround (FILTER_PATTERNS.md - Low Capital Entry Strategies)

**Capital Required:** £120,000-£160,000 (within £200k limit)

**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (broader search for distressed assets across UK)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
7. Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
8. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
9. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
```

**Rationale:**
This non-precedent-based approach exploits motivated sellers with derelict properties in transport-accessible areas, focusing on low-capital acquisitions under £150k. Unlike the Slough precedent, it targets distressed assets for quick turnaround (demolish/rebuild) rather than planning-intensive schemes, aiming for £2M profit through multiple smaller deals (e.g., buy £100k, rebuild £100k, sell £300k each). It uses regulation-driven motivation (derelict status often tied to compliance issues) and time arbitrage (long-hold owners), with no reliance on specific planning precedents.

**Strengths:**
- Low entry capital allows multiple acquisitions within £200k budget
- Derelict status creates strong seller motivation (asset write-down, compliance pressure)
- Transport proximity ensures exit viability for residential redevelopment
- Broad UK scope increases opportunity pool compared to geographic-specific precedents

**Limitations:**
- Derelict properties may have hidden structural issues requiring additional costs
- Planning for rebuild may face local opposition despite unconstrained sites
- Smaller plot sizes limit profit per deal, requiring volume strategy
- Competition from other distressed asset buyers in accessible areas

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run the filter to identify 20-50 derelict sites across the UK, prioritizing those near train stations.
2. Conduct quick site visits to assess rebuild potential and hidden costs.
3. Negotiate direct purchases or options (£5k-£10k) with motivated owners, emphasizing quick cash offers.
4. Secure planning for residential rebuild (often straightforward on unconstrained sites).
5. Execute demolish/rebuild in phases, selling completed units for profit.
6. Scale by repeating the process across multiple sites for cumulative £2M target.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition costs (multiple sites at £50k-£100k each): £100,000
- Demolition and initial rebuild setup: £30,000
- Planning and legal fees: £15,000
- Due diligence and surveys: £10,000
- Contingency for repairs: £5,000
- **Total:** £160,000 (within £200k, scalable across deals)
