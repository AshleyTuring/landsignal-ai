## GROUPINGS & CONVERGENCE

### **Group 1: Precedent-Based Slough Replication (4/4 LLMs Converged) 🎯**
- **Claude-A, Codex-A, Gemini-A, Grok-A**
- **Natural consensus:** All LLMs independently identified Slough 8-storey precedent as strongest strategy
- **Test:** Claude-A (most comprehensive) + Codex-A (unbroken freehold focus) as variants

### **Group 2: HMO/Residential Conversion (2 LLMs)**
- **Codex-B (HMO Conversion), Gemini-C (EPC Arbitrage)**
- **Test both:** Different angles - B targets large C3, C targets tired landlords

### **Group 3: Capital-Efficient Structures (3 LLMs)**
- **Claude-C (Legacy Holdings), Gemini-A (Option Agreement), Gemini-B (Airspace)**
- **Test:** Claude-C + Gemini-B (different mechanisms)

### **Unique Approaches (No Overlap)**
- **Claude-B:** Liquidation (valid but tiny pool)
- **Codex-C:** Brand Covenant Expiry (unique timing angle)
- **Grok-B:** Derelict Turnaround (volume play)

## PART 2: READY-TO-TEST APPROACHES

---

# **APPROACH A: Precedent Replication - Slough 8-Storey Mixed-Use**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude (refined with all LLM consensus)  
**Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals) + Pattern 1A (Stalled Planning)  
**Capital Required:** £50,000-£168,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial" OR "Class E"
3. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
4. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
8. Building on title is inactive: Yes
9. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
10. Sales listing price: is less than 250000
```

## **Rationale**

**ALL 4 LLMs CONVERGED** on this strategy - the strongest signal in the entire synthesis. The approved 8-storey mixed-use in Slough provides **proven planning precedent**, reducing risk from ~40% (speculative) to ~70-80% (proven pathway).

Key mechanics:
- Similar use classes (E + C3) = precedent match
- Low-rise (<4 floors) = intensification headroom
- Transport (<800m station) = density policy support (NPPF)
- Stalled planning (last app before 2022) = opportunity to revive
- Inactive buildings = no income = motivation
- On market + price capped = immediate availability

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Precedent = proven planning path in same authority
- ✅ Low capital via options (£50k-£150k vs £500k+ purchase)
- ✅ Transport proximity = NPPF compliance (Para 11, 120)
- ✅ Inactive + on market = double motivation
- ✅ Stalled planning = shows developer interest (previous attempts)
- ✅ 4/4 LLM consensus = strongest validation signal

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Why did planning stall? Must investigate refusal reasons
- ⚠️ Market listings = competitive (other buyers)
- ⚠️ £250k cap = may exclude larger/better sites
- ⚠️ "Inactive" filter restrictive
- ⚠️ 12-18 month planning timeline

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, desktop due diligence (Land Registry, planning portal)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Investigate why planning stalled (refusal reasons, expiry circumstances)
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Shortlist 10 sites, approach owners with option proposal
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate options (12-24 months, £10k-£50k, planning-contingent)
5. **Months 4-6:** Engage planners (£20k-£50k), pre-app citing precedent
6. **Months 7-18:** Submit application, manage process
7. **Months 19-20:** Market to housebuilders, assign option
8. **Exit:** Sell with consent £800k-£1.2M vs £200k land value

**Profit:** £50k option + £50k planning = £100k → sell £1M = **£900k profit × 2-3 deals = £1.8M-£2.7M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Option agreement: £10,000-£50,000
- Legal fees (option): £3,000-£8,000
- Planning consultant: £20,000-£50,000
- Planning application fees: £10,000-£30,000
- Ground investigation/surveys: £5,000-£15,000
- Contingency (10%): £5,000-£15,000
- **Total:** £53,000-£168,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH B: HMO Conversion - Large C3 to High-Yield**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 22A (HMO Conversion) + Pattern 23A (Unbroken Freehold)  
**Capital Required:** £160,000-£190,000  
**Expected Results:** 25-45 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Property type: is equal to Residential
2. Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
6. Sales listing price: is less than 300000
7. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
8. Latest sold date: is before 2004-01-01
9. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

## **Rationale**

**Value-add conversion** targeting oversized C3 houses (>2000 sqft) with poor EPC. Exploits:
- Unbroken freehold = no leasehold friction (Pattern 23A - critical learning)
- Poor EPC = cannot rent (MEES), needs £20k-£40k = motivation
- Legacy ownership (sold before 2004) = tired landlord
- Stale planning = passive ownership
- **Yield arbitrage:** 3-bed BTL 3-4% → 6-8 bed HMO 6-9% (+150% income)

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Clean acquisition (single negotiation, no leaseholders)
- ✅ EPC pressure = discount motivation
- ✅ Clear HMO scale (>2000 sqft = 6-8 beds proven)
- ✅ Yield uplift 2-3× on same asset
- ✅ Planning risk lower (C3→C4 often permitted)
- ✅ Market liquidity (sell to investors or families)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Article 4 manual check (post-export)
- ⚠️ EPC F/G may = heavy capex (£30k-£50k)
- ⚠️ Floor area data gaps (Rightmove scrape needed)
- ⚠️ Amenity space standards vary
- ⚠️ Conversion costs £40k-£60k
- ⚠️ License saturation in some areas

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, cross-check Article 4 register
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Desktop screening (floor plans, room count viability)
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Approach owners ("EPC problem, needs £30k, we offer cash")
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate 10-20% discount
5. **Months 4-6:** Convert: EPC £20k-£30k, HMO fit-out £20k-£30k
6. **Months 7-8:** HMO license, rent (6-8 beds @ £600/month = £43k-£58k gross)
7. **Exit A:** Hold for 8% net × 5 years
8. **Exit B:** Flip to investor £310k (12 months)

**Profit:** £160k + £50k conversion = £210k → sell £310k = **£100k × 20 = £2M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Acquisition (25% deposit + fees): £80,000
- Conversion works + compliance: £55,000
- Professional fees (architect/MEP/fire): £10,000
- Licensing/EPC/contingency: £15,000
- **Total:** £160,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH C: Legacy Holdings - Off-Market Option Agreements**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings) + Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + Accessibility)  
**Capital Required:** £64,000-£194,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. No latest sold date: Yes
2. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
3. Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
7. Developed area percentage: is less than 40
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Built up areas: Yes
```

## **Rationale**

**INHERITED/LEGACY PROPERTIES** with patient, relationship-based sourcing:
- Never sold = inherited/very long hold (pre-digital Land Registry)
- Private owner = non-professional, may not know development value
- No planning activity = passive holding
- Development-scale (0.25-2 acres) = meaningful mixed-use projects
- Transport accessibility = supports 8-storey policy
- Under-developed (<40%) = land value play

**Behavioral Arbitrage:** Owners often don't know current value, have estate planning motivation, prefer to sell land vs develop.

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Off-market opportunities (no listing = no competition)
- ✅ Information advantage (you know development potential, owner doesn't)
- ✅ Patient capital (option agreements £10k-£50k)
- ✅ Relationship-based (build trust, win-win outcomes)
- ✅ Multiple exit routes (E/B2/B8/C3 all have conversion precedents)
- ✅ Urban context + transport = planning-friendly

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Time-intensive (relationship building takes 3-6 months per owner)
- ⚠️ Low volume (may only yield 10-30 leads, not all convert)
- ⚠️ Owner hard to locate (pre-digital records, contact info outdated)
- ⚠️ Emotional attachment (family holdings may have sentimental value)
- ⚠️ Planning risk (no recent applications = no validated planning potential)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Months 1-2:** Run filter, Land Registry title search (£7/title)
2. **Months 2-4:** Personalized letters + follow-up calls
3. **Months 3-6:** Meet owners, build trust, educate on development potential
4. **Months 6-12:** Negotiate option terms (£10k-£50k, 18-24 months, planning-contingent)
5. **Months 12-30:** Apply for planning (8-storey mixed-use, residential conversion)
6. **Exit A:** Sell option to developer (£100k-£500k profit, fast)
7. **Exit B:** Exercise option, sell with planning (£1M-£3M+ profit, slower)

**Profit:** £30k option + £50k planning = £80k → sell £1.5M = **£1.42M × 1-2 deals = £1.42M-£2.84M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Land Registry searches: £2,000-£3,000 (300 titles)
- Planning consultant (pre-app): £10,000-£20,000
- Option fee (per site): £10,000-£50,000
- Legal fees (option agreement): £5,000-£10,000
- Outreach/marketing: £2,000-£5,000
- Contingency (10%): £3,000-£9,000
- **Total per site:** £32,000-£97,000
- **Portfolio (2-3 sites):** £64,000-£194,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH D: Airspace Development - Flat Roof Intensification**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (structural risk)  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace Development)  
**Capital Required:** £170,000-£195,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink]
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 750
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15
```

## **Rationale**

**Structural arbitrage:** Purchase airspace rights (20-40% of freehold value) vs full ownership.

Critical refinement: `Number of leaseholds: 0` eliminates #1 deal-killer (Pattern 23B from LEARNINGS_DATABASE).

⚠️ **WARNING:** 30-40% of sites fail structural survey (£10k-£15k sunk cost). Budget for multiple tests.

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Very low capital (£100k vs £500k freehold)
- ✅ Landowner keeps income (easier negotiation)
- ✅ Policy support (housing crisis, London Plan H2)
- ✅ Flat roof = lower costs (no reconstruction)
- ✅ Unbroken freehold = no leasehold negotiation

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** 30-40% fail structural survey (non-recoverable £10k-£15k)
- ⚠️ Party wall agreements (2-6 month delay)
- ⚠️ Fire regs (second staircase £80k-£150k)
- ⚠️ Construction disruption (limits contractors)
- ⚠️ Right to light claims (BRE guidelines strict)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-3:** Run filter (London, Reading, Slough, Brighton)
2. **Weeks 4-6:** Desktop screening (roof verification)
3. **Weeks 7-10:** Approach freeholders (profit-share: 30%/70%)
4. **Weeks 11-14:** Negotiate airspace (£80k-£120k, conditional on structural survey)
5. **Months 4-5:** **CRITICAL:** Structural survey (if fails, abort)
6. **Months 6-8:** If pass, architect design (4-5 storeys)
7. **Months 9-14:** Planning application
8. **Exit:** Sell airspace + consent £600k-£1M = **£400k-£850k profit**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Airspace purchase: £120,000
- Structural/Architectural/Planning Fees: £50,000
- **Total:** £170,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**

⚠️ **CONDITIONAL:** Only proceed if comfortable with 30-40% failure rate.

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH E: Derelict Turnaround - Low-Capital Volume Play**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 4C (Derelict Asset Turnaround)  
**Capital Required:** £120,000-£160,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
7. Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
8. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
9. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
```

## **Rationale**

**Distressed assets** with motivated sellers. Exploits:
- Derelict status = compliance pressure (asset write-down)
- Low entry capital (<£150k) allows multiple acquisitions
- Transport proximity = exit viability for residential
- Long hold (sold before 2010) = tired landlord
- No planning activity = passive holding

**Volume strategy:** Buy £100k, rebuild £100k, sell £300k each × multiple deals = £2M target

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Low entry capital allows multiple acquisitions within £200k
- ✅ Derelict status = strong seller motivation
- ✅ Transport proximity ensures exit viability
- ✅ Broad UK scope increases opportunity pool
- ✅ Unconstrained sites (>80%) = planning-friendly

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Hidden structural issues requiring additional costs
- ⚠️ Planning for rebuild may face local opposition
- ⚠️ Smaller plot sizes limit profit per deal (requires volume)
- ⚠️ Competition from other distressed asset buyers

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter across UK, prioritize near train stations
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Site visits to assess rebuild potential
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Negotiate direct purchases (£5k-£10k options)
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Secure planning for residential rebuild
5. **Months 4-12:** Execute demolish/rebuild in phases
6. **Exit:** Sell completed units for profit
7. **Scale:** Repeat across multiple sites for cumulative £2M target

**Profit:** £100k acquisition + £30k demolish/setup = £130k → sell £200k = **£70k × 15-20 deals = £1.05M-£1.4M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

- Acquisition costs (multiple sites at £50k-£100k each): £100,000
- Demolition and initial rebuild setup: £30,000
- Planning and legal fees: £15,000
- Due diligence and surveys: £10,000
- Contingency for repairs: £5,000
- **Total:** £160,000 ✅ **Within £200k budget**

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **Validation Summary**

✅ **FULLY VALID (Test Immediately):**
- Approach A: Precedent Replication (4/4 LLM consensus - STRONGEST SIGNAL)
- Approach B: HMO Conversion
- Approach C: Legacy Holdings
- Approach E: Derelict Turnaround

⚠️ **CONDITIONAL:**
- Approach D: Airspace (30-40% structural failure, budget multiple surveys)

❌ **EXCLUDED:**
- Claude-B: Liquidation (5-20 results too limited)
- Claude-D: High-PTAL (requires £225k+ or JV partner)
- Codex-C: Brand Covenant (lease timing complexity)
- Gemini-C: EPC Arbitrage (lower profit per deal, requires volume)

---

### **Recommended Testing Sequence**

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Highest Probability**
1. **Approach A** (Precedent) - 4/4 LLM consensus = strongest signal
2. **Approach B** (HMO Conversion) - clear value-add

**Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Capital-Efficient**
3. **Approach C** (Legacy Holdings) - patient capital, off-market
4. **Approach E** (Derelict Turnaround) - volume play

**Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Conditional**
5. **Approach D** (Airspace) - only if comfortable with failure rate

---

### **Key Learnings**

**Convergence Insights:**
- **4/4 LLMs** → Precedent replication = strongest signal
- **Pattern 23A** → Unbroken freehold critical (appears in 3 approaches)
- **Transport accessibility** → <800m-1000m train station universal

**Critical Refinements:**
- Pattern 23A: `Number of leaseholds: 0` prevents #1 airspace killer
- Article 4: Manual check post-export (HMO approaches)
- Structural contingency: £10k-£15k for airspace failures
- Stalled planning: Investigate refusal reasons before proceeding

**Diversity Preserved:** 5 distinct strategies (not forced convergence)
