# Synthesis Task

## Your Role
You are the neutral synthesizer. Read all approaches and all critiques, then:

1. **Group Similar Approaches:** Identify natural convergence (LLMs proposing similar strategies)
2. **Preserve Distinct Approaches:** Identify genuinely different strategies worth testing
3. **Apply Critiques:** Use technical feedback to refine approaches
4. **Create Validation Matrix:** Mark each approach VALID/CONDITIONAL/INVALID
5. **Extract Ready-to-Test:** Create clean, executable prompts for SearchLand AI

## Key Principles
- **Preserve diversity:** Don't force convergence - multiple valid approaches can coexist
- **Apply technical fixes:** Use critique feedback to improve approaches
- **Be pragmatic:** CONDITIONAL approaches (minor issues) are still testable
- **Group smartly:** Similar approaches = natural consensus (not forced)

## Output Part 1: Validation Matrix

Create a table:

| Approach | Original LLM | Pattern Used | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| A | Gemini | Pattern X | VALID | Ready to test |
| B | Codex | Pattern Y | CONDITIONAL | Needs unit fix |
| C | Grok | Pattern Z | INVALID | Filter doesn't exist |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Groupings (if applicable):**
- Approaches [A, D, G] are similar (precedent-based) - recommend testing as variants
- Approaches [B, E] both use Pattern X - recommend testing Approach B only (more refined)

## ALL APPROACHES (Original)

### Claude_Approaches

Based on my comprehensive analysis of your requirements, reference materials, and strategic patterns, I'll generate **4 unique property search strategies** that cover:

1. **Precedent-based** approaches (replicating the Slough 8-storey mixed-use approval)
2. **Motivation-driven** approaches (behavioral arbitrage)
3. **Capital-efficient** structures (within £200k budget)
4. **Strategic diversity** across multiple angles

---

## Approach A: Slough Precedent Replication - Stalled Mixed-Use with Height Approval

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A (Expired/Stalled Planning) + Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreement or distressed purchase)  
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties (highly targeted)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial" OR "Class E"
3. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
4. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
8. Building on title is inactive: Yes
9. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
10. Sales listing price: is less than 250000
```

### Rationale:

This approach **replicates the Slough precedent** by finding sites with:
- **Similar planning history:** Previous mixed-use proposals with multiple storeys (filters 1-2)
- **Current under-development:** <4 floors existing = intensification potential (filter 3)
- **Stalled planning:** Last application 2+ years ago, <3 apps in 5 years (filters 4-5)
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m train station supports density policy (filter 6)
- **Appropriate size:** 0.15-1.5 acres = 6,500-65,000 sqft (similar to Slough site) (filter 7)
- **Inactive buildings:** Derelict/unused = motivated seller signal (filter 8)
- **Active listings:** On market + price capped at £250k (filters 9-10)

**Planning Precedent Logic:**  
The Slough approval demonstrates that 8-storey mixed-use (retail ground floor + residential above) is achievable in transport-accessible locations. This filter finds similar sites where:
- Planning was previously attempted (demonstrates developer interest)
- Applications have stalled (opportunity for you to revive)
- Current low-rise = intensification upside
- Listed for sale = motivated seller

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Proven precedent:** 8-storey mixed-use approved in Slough = replicable
- ✅ **Planning de-risked:** Similar proposals already attempted (shows viability)
- ✅ **Motivated sellers:** Stalled planning + inactive building + on market
- ✅ **Transport policy support:** <800m train = density-friendly planning context
- ✅ **Capital-efficient:** £50k-£250k acquisition, option agreements possible
- ✅ **High profit potential:** Low-rise to 8-storey = 4-6x floor area increase

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Why did planning stall?** Must investigate refusal reasons (if applicable)
- ⚠️ **Market listings = competitive:** Other buyers may be circling
- ⚠️ **£250k cap = limited pool:** May exclude larger/better sites
- ⚠️ **"Inactive" filter restrictive:** Could miss occupied buildings with potential
- ⚠️ **Transport dependency:** <800m train station excludes some viable sites

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Site Identification (Week 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Review each property's planning history on Local Planning Authority (LPA) website
3. Identify refusal reasons (if refused) or expiry circumstances (if lapsed)
4. Shortlist sites where planning failure was addressable (design, affordable housing %, etc.)

**Phase 2: Precedent Research (Week 2-3)**
5. For each shortlisted site, search LPA for similar approved schemes within 500m
6. Document precedents: height approved, unit mix, density, S106 obligations
7. Assess policy context: Is LPA pro-growth? Housing delivery test failed? (motivation to approve)

**Phase 3: Owner Outreach (Week 3-4)**
8. Contact owners directly (Land Registry title search for details)
9. Approach: "I've identified planning potential on your site. Would you consider an option agreement?"
10. Negotiate option: £10k-£50k fee, 12-24 month term, planning-contingent

**Phase 4: Planning Strategy (Month 2-12)**
11. Engage planning consultant (£20k-£50k for pre-app + submission)
12. Pre-application advice from LPA (de-risk before formal submission)
13. Address previous refusal reasons (if applicable)
14. Submit planning application (£10k-£30k fees depending on size)

**Phase 5: Exit (Month 12-18)**
15. **Option 1 - Sell with planning:** Exit to housebuilder at 40-50% of GDV (£2M+ profit if successful)
16. **Option 2 - Sell option:** Sell option to developer for £100k-£500k (lower profit, faster exit)
17. **Option 3 - JV with housebuilder:** Contribute land, they fund build, split profit 30/70

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Site option agreement:** £10k-£50k
- **Legal fees (option):** £3k-£8k
- **Planning consultant:** £20k-£50k
- **Planning application fees:** £10k-£30k
- **Ground investigation/surveys:** £5k-£15k
- **Contingency (10%):** £5k-£15k
- **Total:** £53k-£168k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit:

- **Scenario 1 (Slough replication):** 8-storey, 40 units, £400k/unit GDV = £16M GDV
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,000/sqm × 3,000sqm) = £6M
- **Less:** S106/CIL = £2M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £1M
- **Residual land value:** £7M
- **Your profit (if sell with planning at 50% RLV):** £3.5M
- **Less your costs:** £168k
- **Net profit:** £3.3M ✅ **Exceeds £2M target**

## Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales with Development Potential

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales) + Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (distressed pricing + legal)  
**Expected Results:** 5-20 properties (very targeted, high motivation)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 5
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, Outside of the defined classes]
6. Building on title is derelict: Yes
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **FORCED SELLERS** - companies in liquidation with development-potential assets:

- **Liquidation = maximum motivation:** Legal obligation to sell (filter 1-2)
- **Developable size:** 0.2-5 acres = 8,700-217,800 sqft (meaningful projects) (filter 3)
- **Transport accessibility:** <1km train supports residential conversion/mixed-use (filter 4)
- **Commercial/industrial use:** E/B2/B8/Sui Generis = conversion opportunities (filter 5)
- **Derelict buildings:** Double motivation (cannot generate income) (filter 6)
- **Clean planning:** Excludes major blockers (filter 7)
- **70%+ unconstrained:** Developable land (filter 8)

**Behavioral Economics Logic:**  
Liquidators are motivated by:
1. **Speed:** Must complete sales quickly (creditor pressure)
2. **Certainty:** Cash buyers preferred (no financing contingencies)
3. **Below-market pricing:** Discounts of 20-40% common in forced sales
4. **Clear decision-maker:** Liquidator has authority (no emotional attachment)

This creates a **buyer's market** where you have negotiating leverage.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **VERY strong motivation:** Forced sale = legal obligation
- ✅ **Below-market pricing:** Liquidation sales typically 20-40% discount
- ✅ **Speed advantage:** Liquidators prioritize fast completion
- ✅ **Clear decision-maker:** No emotional attachment, professional seller
- ✅ **Conversion opportunities:** Commercial/industrial → residential/mixed-use
- ✅ **Double motivation:** Liquidation + derelict = maximum urgency
- ✅ **Low competition:** Many buyers avoid liquidation complexity

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Very limited pool:** Liquidations are rare (5-20 results expected)
- ⚠️ **Legal complexity:** May have creditor claims, liens, environmental liabilities
- ⚠️ **Unknown condition:** Derelict buildings may have structural issues
- ⚠️ **Timeline pressure:** Liquidator may accept first reasonable offer (act fast)
- ⚠️ **Planning uncertainty:** Conversion not guaranteed (especially B2/B8 in some LPAs)

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Rapid Response (Week 1)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Identify liquidator contact (Companies House, Land Registry)
3. **Same-day outreach:** Call liquidator within 24 hours of discovery
4. Position: "Cash buyer, 4-week completion, no financing contingency"

**Phase 2: Due Diligence (Week 1-3)**
5. Fast-track title search (Land Registry - £7, 24hr turnaround)
6. Desktop environmental assessment (Phase 1 - £2k-£5k)
7. Review creditor claims (Companies House records)
8. Structural survey (derelict buildings - £3k-£8k)
9. Planning pre-app (informal discussion with LPA - £0-£1k)

**Phase 3: Negotiation (Week 2-4)**
10. Offer 60-70% of market value (liquidator will negotiate)
11. Highlight: Speed, certainty, cash, no contingencies
12. Lock in exclusivity (7-14 days) with £5k-£10k deposit
13. Agree 4-6 week completion (faster = better price)

**Phase 4: Acquisition (Week 4-6)**
14. Exchange contracts (solicitor fees £5k-£10k)
15. Complete purchase (cash payment or bridging finance)
16. Secure site (insurance, security, make safe)

**Phase 5: Exit (Month 3-18)**
17. **Option 1 - Quick flip:** Sell to developer immediately (10-30% profit, 3-6 months)
18. **Option 2 - Planning gain:** Apply for planning, sell with consent (50-100% profit, 12-18 months)
19. **Option 3 - JV:** Partner with developer (land contribution, they build, split profit)

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Site acquisition:** £80k-£120k (distressed pricing)
- **Legal fees:** £5k-£10k
- **Due diligence:** £8k-£15k (surveys, environmental, title)
- **Make safe/security:** £2k-£5k
- **Planning pre-app/advice:** £5k-£10k
- **Contingency (10%):** £10k-£16k
- **Total:** £110k-£176k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit:

**Scenario 1: Quick flip (no planning)**
- Acquisition: £100k (below market)
- Market value (as-is): £150k
- Sell to developer: £130k-£140k
- Net profit: £20k-£30k (3-6 months)
- **ROI:** 20-30% in <6 months ⚠️ Below £2M target but fast capital recycling

**Scenario 2: Planning gain (residential conversion)**
- Acquisition: £100k
- Planning costs: £30k-£60k
- Market value with consent: £500k-£1M (depending on units approved)
- Sell at 70% of market: £350k-£700k
- Less costs: £130k-£160k
- Net profit: £220k-£570k (12-18 months)
- **ROI:** 140-360% ⚠️ Still below £2M target but excellent return

**Scenario 3: Portfolio strategy (multiple sites)**
- Repeat process 3-5 times with £200k capital (recycled)
- Average profit per site: £200k-£400k
- Total profit (3-5 sites over 18-24 months): £600k-£2M ✅ **Can hit £2M target with volume**

---

## Approach C: Legacy Holdings Conversion - Off-Market Mixed-Use Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings) + Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + Accessibility)  
**Capital Required:** £10k-£50k (option agreements, patient capital)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (relationship-based sourcing)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. No latest sold date
2. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
3. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
7. Developed area percentage: is less than 40
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Built up areas
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **INHERITED/LEGACY PROPERTIES** with patient, relationship-based sourcing:

- **Never sold:** No Land Registry sale record = inherited/very long hold (filter 1)
- **Private owner:** Non-professional, may not know development value (filter 2)
- **No planning activity:** <1 app in 5 years = passive holding (filter 3)
- **Development-scale:** 0.25-2 acres = meaningful mixed-use projects (filter 4)
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m train = supports 8-storey policy (filter 5)
- **Flexible use:** E/B2/B8/C3 = multiple conversion routes (filter 6)
- **Under-developed:** <40% developed = land value play (filter 7)
- **Clean planning:** Excludes major constraints (filter 8)
- **Urban context:** Built-up areas = residential policy support (filter 9)

**Behavioral Arbitrage Logic:**  
Owners of never-sold properties often:
1. **Don't know current value:** Inherited decades ago, no recent valuation
2. **Estate planning motivation:** Elderly owners looking to liquidate
3. **Tax liability concerns:** CGT on development gain, prefer to sell land
4. **Non-professional:** Not developers, don't understand planning potential
5. **Off-market:** Not actively marketed (no agent competition)

This creates **information asymmetry** - you know the development potential, they don't.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Off-market opportunities:** No listing = no competition
- ✅ **Information advantage:** You know development potential, owner doesn't
- ✅ **Patient capital:** Low upfront cost (option agreements £10k-£50k)
- ✅ **Relationship-based:** Build trust, win-win outcomes (fair price for owner, upside for you)
- ✅ **Multiple exit routes:** E/B2/B8/C3 all have conversion precedents
- ✅ **Urban context:** Built-up areas + transport = planning-friendly
- ✅ **No active developers:** 0 apps in 5 years = no competition from other developers

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Time-intensive:** Relationship building takes 3-6 months per owner
- ⚠️ **Low volume:** May only yield 10-30 leads, not all convert
- ⚠️ **Owner hard to locate:** "No sold date" = pre-digital records, contact info may be outdated
- ⚠️ **Emotional attachment:** Family holdings may have sentimental value (resistance to sell)
- ⚠️ **Planning risk:** No recent applications = no validated planning potential

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Targeted Sourcing (Month 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Land Registry title search for owner details (£7/title, 300 titles = £2,100)
3. Cross-reference with Electoral Roll, Companies House (find contact info)
4. Create property dossiers: photos, planning policy analysis, precedent research

**Phase 2: Outreach Campaign (Month 2-4)**
5. **Personalized letters:** Not generic direct mail - reference specific property, local precedents
6. Follow-up calls (2-3 weeks after letter)
7. **Value proposition:** "I specialize in helping landowners unlock planning potential. Would you consider an option agreement where I fund planning, you retain ownership, we share upside?"
8. **Education:** Explain development potential, show comparable sales, demonstrate value

**Phase 3: Relationship Building (Month 3-6)**
9. Meet owners in person (site visits, coffee meetings)
10. Build trust: Professional, transparent, fair
11. Address concerns: "You keep ownership, no risk, I fund planning, we split profit 40/60"
12. Introduce to planning consultant (credibility)

**Phase 4: Option Agreements (Month 6-12)**
13. Negotiate option terms:
    - Option fee: £10k-£50k (non-refundable, against purchase price)
    - Term: 18-24 months (time to secure planning)
    - Strike price: £500k-£2M (fair market value for current use)
    - Overage: 30-40% of uplift (planning gain split)
14. Legal documentation (solicitor £5k-£10k)
15. Exercise conditions: Planning consent granted

**Phase 5: Planning & Exit (Month 12-30)**
16. Apply for planning (8-storey mixed-use, residential conversion, etc.)
17. **Exit Option 1:** Sell option to developer (£100k-£500k profit, fast)
18. **Exit Option 2:** Exercise option, sell with planning (£1M-£3M+ profit, slower)
19. **Exit Option 3:** JV with developer (land + planning, split build profit)

### Capital Breakdown (Per Site):

- **Land Registry searches:** £2k-£3k (300 titles)
- **Planning consultant (pre-app):** £10k-£20k
- **Option fee (per site):** £10k-£50k
- **Legal fees (option agreement):** £5k-£10k
- **Outreach/marketing:** £2k-£5k (letters, calls, site visits)
- **Contingency (10%):** £3k-£9k
- **Total per site:** £32k-£97k
- **Portfolio (2-3 sites):** £64k-£194k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit (Per Site):

**Scenario 1: Sell option (no planning)**
- Option fee invested: £30k
- Sell option to developer: £100k-£300k
- Net profit: £70k-£270k (12-18 months)
- **ROI:** 230-900% per site

**Scenario 2: Exercise option + sell with planning**
- Option fee: £30k
- Planning costs: £50k-£80k
- Strike price: £1M (pay owner)
- Market value with planning: £3M-£5M (8-storey mixed-use)
- Sell at 60% of market: £1.8M-£3M
- Less costs: £1.08M-£1.11M
- Net profit: £690k-£1.89M (24-36 months)
- **ROI:** 638-1,750% per site ✅ **Single site can hit £2M target**

**Scenario 3: Portfolio (3 sites)**
- Average profit per site (sell options): £150k
- Total profit (3 sites): £450k (18-24 months)
- **Plus:** 1 site with planning exercise: +£1.5M
- **Total portfolio profit:** £1.95M ✅ **Close to £2M target**

## Approach D: High-PTAL Low-Rise Intensification - London Tall Building Zones

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) + Pattern 3A (Development Opportunity)  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£200k (deposit/option for higher-value sites)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (London-focused, policy-supported)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
2. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.2
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, C3 - Dwellinghouses, Outside of the defined classes]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Green Belt]
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
7. Developed area percentage: is greater than 20 AND less than 60
8. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
9. Sales listing price: is less than 2000000
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **TALL BUILDING POLICY SUPPORT** in London's highest-accessibility zones:

- **Excellent transport:** PTAL 5-6b = London's best-connected areas (filter 1)
- **Low-rise existing:** <4 floors = intensification opportunity (filter 2)
- **Development-scale:** 0.15-1.2 acres = 6,500-52,000 sqft (suitable for 8-storey) (filter 3)
- **Flexible use:** E/B2/B8/C3/Sui Generis = multiple routes to residential (filter 4)
- **Clean heritage:** No conservation/listed constraints (filter 5)
- **75%+ unconstrained:** Developable (filter 6)
- **Partially developed:** 20-60% = existing use (income during planning) but land for intensification (filter 7)
- **Active market:** On-market listings (filter 8)
- **Capital-efficient:** <£2M price (deposit £200k + debt financing) (filter 9)

**Planning Policy Logic:**  
London's tall building policies (London Plan 2021) explicitly support height in:
- **PTAL 4-6:** High transport accessibility
- **Opportunity Areas:** Designated growth zones
- **Town centres:** Commercial intensification

This filter finds **policy-backed intensification opportunities** where 8-storey is defensible.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Planning policy support:** PTAL 5-6b = tall building policy zones
- ✅ **London precedents:** Many 8-storey+ approvals in PTAL 5-6b areas
- ✅ **Existing use value:** 20-60% developed = income during planning (reduces hold cost)
- ✅ **Multiple conversion routes:** E/B2/B8/C3 all viable in London
- ✅ **Higher land values:** London = higher residual values (supports £2M profit target)
- ✅ **Active market:** On-market listings = immediate availability
- ✅ **Clean title:** 75%+ unconstrained = fewer planning obstacles

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **London-specific:** PTAL only in TfL area (excludes rest of UK)
- ⚠️ **Higher acquisition cost:** £1M-£2M price requires debt (£200k deposit + £1.8M loan)
- ⚠️ **Competition:** On-market listings = other buyers bidding
- ⚠️ **Planning risk:** Tall building policies have local opposition risk
- ⚠️ **S106/CIL costs:** London = high affordable housing % (35-50%) and CIL

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Site Filtering (Week 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Overlay with London Plan Opportunity Areas map (GLA website)
3. Prioritize sites in:
   - Opportunity Areas (growth zones)
   - Town centres (commercial intensification)
   - Areas with recent 8-storey+ approvals (precedent)
4. Shortlist 10-15 sites with strongest planning case

**Phase 2: Planning Viability (Week 2-4)**
5. Review local plan policies (each London borough has tall building policy)
6. Search planning portal for nearby precedents (8-storey+ approvals within 500m)
7. Assess precedent quality:
   - Similar height? ✅
   - Similar use (mixed-use)? ✅
   - Recent approval (last 3 years)? ✅
   - Consistent with local policy? ✅
8. Desktop viability assessment (£20k-£40k planning consultant)

**Phase 3: Financing (Week 3-6)**
9. Approach development finance brokers (bridging loan + planning exit)
10. Structure: £200k equity + £1.8M debt (max £2M acquisition)
11. Debt terms: 18-24 month bridge, 1-2% monthly interest, planning exit refinance
12. Pre-approval (conditional on site acquisition)

**Phase 4: Acquisition (Month 2-3)**
13. Make offer (£1.5M-£1.8M, allowing £200k buffer for costs)
14. Due diligence: Title, surveys, planning pre-app (£15k-£30k)
15. Exchange with 10% deposit (£150k-£180k)
16. Complete with debt drawdown

**Phase 5: Planning (Month 3-18)**
17. Engage London planning specialist (£40k-£80k full service)
18. Pre-application with LPA (£5k-£10k fee, 2-3 meetings)
19. Design: 8-storey mixed-use, ground floor retail/E, upper floors residential
20. Target: 30-50 units (depending on site size)
21. S106 negotiation: Affordable housing %, CIL, public realm
22. Submit application (£20k-£50k fee)
23. Target approval: 12-15 months

**Phase 6: Exit (Month 15-24)**
24. **Exit Option 1:** Sell with planning to housebuilder (40-50% RLV)
25. **Exit Option 2:** JV with housebuilder (30% land, 70% build profit split)
26. **Exit Option 3:** Forward-fund with pension fund (pre-let, they fund build, fixed land payment)

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Deposit (10%):** £150k-£180k
- **Legal/surveys/due diligence:** £15k-£30k
- **Planning consultant:** £40k-£80k (spread over 12-18 months)
- **Planning fees:** £20k-£50k
- **Interest on debt (18 months @ 1.5%/month):** £486k-£583k (rolled into debt, paid at exit)
- **Total equity required:** £225k ⚠️ **Slightly over £200k budget** (can reduce by negotiating lower acquisition or using JV partner equity)

**Adjusted Capital Strategy (To Stay Within £200k):**
- Reduce acquisition target to £1.5M (£150k deposit)
- Co-invest with planning partner (50/50 equity split = £112.5k deposit)
- **Total your equity:** £112.5k deposit + £40k planning share = £152.5k ✅ **Within £200k**

### Expected Profit:

**Scenario 1: 8-storey mixed-use (40 units)**
- **GDV:** £500k/unit × 40 units = £20M
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,500/sqm × 4,000sqm) = £10M
- **Less:** S106/CIL (40% affordable + £2M CIL) = £4M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £1.5M
- **Residual land value:** £4.5M
- **Sell at 50% RLV:** £2.25M
- **Less:** Acquisition + debt repayment = £2M + £0.5M interest = £2.5M
- **Your profit (50% equity share):** (£2.25M - £2.5M) × 50% = -£125k ⚠️ **Loss scenario** (conservative)

**Scenario 2: Optimistic (50 units, lower build cost)**
- **GDV:** £500k/unit × 50 units = £25M
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,200/sqm × 5,000sqm) = £11M
- **Less:** S106/CIL = £5M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £2M
- **Residual land value:** £7M
- **Sell at 50% RLV:** £3.5M
- **Less:** Acquisition + debt repayment = £2.5M
- **Your profit (50% equity share):** (£3.5M - £2.5M) × 50% = £500k ✅ **Profitable but below £2M target**

**Scenario 3: Portfolio (3 sites over 3 years)**
- Average profit per site: £500k
- Total profit: £1.5M (36 months)
- **Close to £2M target but requires recycling capital**

**Critical Issue with This Approach:**  
The profit margins are tight due to:
- High London land values
- High S106/CIL obligations (35-50% affordable housing)
- High build costs (£2,000-£2,500/sqm)

**This approach requires higher capital** than £200k to be viable, OR **a JV partner to share equity**.

## Summary & Recommendations

| Approach | Capital | Timeline | Expected Profit | Risk Level | Feasibility within £200k |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| **A: Precedent Replication** | £53k-£168k | 12-18m | £2M-£3.5M | Medium | ✅ **Excellent** |
| **B: Liquidation Arbitrage** | £110k-£176k | 12-18m (portfolio) | £600k-£2M (volume) | Medium-High | ✅ **Good** (requires volume) |
| **C: Legacy Holdings** | £64k-£194k | 24-36m | £690k-£1.9M/site | Medium | ✅ **Excellent** (patient capital) |
| **D: High-PTAL Intensification** | £225k+ (or £152.5k with partner) | 15-24m | £500k-£1M/site | High | ⚠️ **Marginal** (needs JV partner) |

### My Recommendation: **Approach A + Approach C in Parallel**

**Why:**

1. **Approach A (Precedent Replication):**
   - Best fit for £200k capital (£53k-£168k)
   - Directly targets Slough precedent (8-storey mixed-use)
   - Highest profit potential (£2M-£3.5M per site)
   - 12-18 month timeline (reasonable)
   - Medium risk (planning precedent reduces uncertainty)

2. **Approach C (Legacy Holdings):**
   - Complementary strategy (relationship-based, off-market)
   - Low upfront capital (£10k-£50k per option)
   - Can pursue 2-3 sites in parallel
   - Longer timeline (24-36m) but very high ROI (£690k-£1.9M per site)
   - Builds pipeline for future projects

**Combined Strategy:**
- **Year 1:** Launch both approaches simultaneously
  - **Approach A:** Shortlist 5-10 stalled mixed-use sites, secure 1-2 options (£100k capital)
  - **Approach C:** Outreach to 50-100 legacy holdings, secure 2-3 options (£100k capital)
  - **Total capital deployed:** £200k
  
- **Year 2:** Execute planning on Approach A sites (fastest to market)
  - Exit 1 site with planning: **£2M-£3.5M profit** ✅ **Hits target**
  
- **Year 2-3:** Continue Approach C (longer-term, off-market plays)
  - Exit 1-2 sites with planning/options: **£1M-£2M additional profit**
  - **Total portfolio profit (3 years):** £3M-£5.5M

**Why NOT Approach B or D:**
- **Approach B (Liquidation):** Excellent strategy but very limited supply (5-20 sites) + requires volume to hit £2M (3-5 transactions)
- **Approach D (High-PTAL London):** Requires higher capital (£225k+ or JV partner) + tight profit margins due to London costs

### Codex_Approaches

## Approach A: Slough Mid-Rise Intensification (Precedent Match)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £180k (option + DD + planning)  
**Expected Results:** 12-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local planning authority: is equal to Slough
2. Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Property type: is one of [Mixed Use, Commercial]
4. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Max building height (m): is less than 12
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
9. Building on title is inactive: Yes
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
11. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Green Belt]
```

**Rationale:**
Targets Slough titles with existing E/C3 mix but sub-12m height and inactivity, matching the approved 8-storey mixed-use precedent. High-access sites within 800m of rail mirror Slough centre transport context. Unbroken freeholds remove assembly risk (Pattern 23A), while low app count surfaces fresh stock.

**Strengths:**
- Direct geographic precedent alignment (Slough + mixed-use + under-height)
- Single freehold simplifies negotiation and airspace/intensification
- Inactivity and low app count flag dormant value
- Rail proximity strengthens tall-building policy support
- Tight size band calibrated for 8-storey massing

**Limitations:**
- Slough-only may constrain volume
- Some mixed-use titles may already be income-productive (harder to buy)
- Station-proximate stock can price high
- Inactivity flag can include structurally poor assets
- Exclusion of constraints may miss viable conservation-edge plays

**Implementation Strategy:**
Sequence titles by station distance and roof condition; walk-by for roof/structure viability. Lead with option/subject-to-planning; anchor price to vacant value. Commission massing test + pre-app citing nearby 8-storey approval; emphasize uplift from sub-12m baseline. If retail leases exist, negotiate surrender aligned to planning grant.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Site option fee: £60k  
- Planning + pre-app + surveys: £45k  
- Legal + option structuring: £20k  
- Technical (massing, transport, utilities): £25k  
- Contingency: £30k  
- **Total:** £180k (≤£200k)


## Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (High Yield, Low Capital)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 22A: HMO Conversion + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £160k (deposit + works)  
**Expected Results:** 25-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is equal to Residential
2. Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
6. Sales listing price: is less than 300000
7. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
8. Latest sold date: is less than 2004
9. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
10. Article 4 Direction: does not contain [C4/HMO]
11. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:**
Targets large, legacy-held freehold houses (>2,000 sqft) under £300k with poor EPC and no HMO Article 4, ideal for high-yield conversion. Unbroken titles avoid leasehold complications; low planning activity and old sale dates signal disengaged owners.

**Strengths:**
- High margin uplift (5-8% HMO vs 3-4% BTL)
- Low entry price fits £200k capital with leverage
- EPC E-G enables price negotiation + grant leverage
- No Article 4 reduces change-of-use risk
- Legacy ownership improves off-market receptivity

**Limitations:**
- Article 4 coverage must be double-checked manually
- EPC upgrades add cost/time
- Some assets may need significant capex to HMO standards
- Valuers may downvalue in weaker rental micro-markets
- Planning/classification nuances if sui generis scale pursued

**Implementation Strategy:**
Target secondary towns with strong student/professional demand; validate no Article 4 at LPA level. Offer quick close; structure with bridge-to-term. Execute EPC uplift and internal replan to 6-8 beds; certify fire safety and licensing early.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- 25% deposit + fees on £280k buy: £80k  
- Conversion works + compliance: £55k  
- Professional fees (architect/MEP/fire): £10k  
- Licensing/EPC/contingency: £15k  
- **Total:** £160k (≤£200k)


## Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry Reposition (QSR/Retail to Mixed Use)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 20A: Brand Covenant Expiry + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £190k (option + DD)  
**Expected Results:** 10-20 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is one of [Commercial, Mixed Use]
2. Use class: contains any [E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, E(b) - Food and drink]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Lease end date (year): is less than 2027
6. Average daily footfall: is greater than 6000
7. Max building height (m): is less than 12
8. Title area (sqft): is greater than 7000 AND less than 30000
9. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed building]
```

**Rationale:**
Focuses on high-footfall QSR/retail sites with leases expiring before 2027, enabling surrender/regear and reposition to mixed-use/resi. Sub-12m height and sizable plots support upward/airspace development; unbroken freeholds avoid headlease friction.

**Strengths:**
- Imminent lease expiry creates motivated landlords/tenants
- Footfall validates future commercial at ground floor
- Under-height stock ripe for airspace intensification
- Single freehold simplifies redevelopment timing
- Low planning history indicates untouched uplift

**Limitations:**
- Lease events may already be in negotiation
- Some brands hold renewal rights; surrender costs possible
- High-footfall sites can command strong residual values
- Constraint exclusions may miss edge-case heritage wins
- Footfall data needs on-the-ground validation

**Implementation Strategy:**
Rank by lease end proximity and footfall. Engage landlord and tenant for tri-party: offer surrender plus profit-share on new scheme. Run feasibility on 4-8 resi units above retained/reshaped ground floor. Structure via option/AGM with overage; secure pre-app early to evidence planning support.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/premium to control site: £70k  
- Planning/design/transport/noise studies: £50k  
- Legal + lease surrender negotiation: £35k  
- Contingency (early surveys/rights of light): £35k  
- **Total:** £190k (≤£200k)

## Approach A: Precedent-Driven Intensification (Option Agreement)

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + High Accessibility) and Pattern 4B (Low Capital Entry - Option Agreement)
**Capital Required:** £65,000 (Option & Planning Fees)
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 1.5
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
6. Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
8. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets properties that mirror the fundamental characteristics of the Slough precedent: a mixed-use development in a high-density, transport-oriented location. By filtering for low-rise buildings (`<12m`) near train stations (`<500m`), we identify under-developed sites with strong policy support for intensification (Pattern 3A). The plot size is sufficient for a significant 8-storey scheme.

Crucially, this strategy is adapted for the £200k capital constraint. By targeting off-market properties held for over 10 years (Pattern 4B), we identify owners who may be receptive to an option agreement, eliminating the need for a high upfront acquisition cost. The capital is deployed for securing the site and achieving planning permission, creating value through planning uplift.

**Strengths:**
- Directly emulates the successful planning precedent.
- Targets locations with strong policy support for height and density.
- Capital-efficient strategy, using an option agreement to control a high-value asset with low upfront cost.
- Off-market approach avoids competitive bidding.
- Identifies "tired" owners who may be more flexible on terms.

**Limitations:**
- Success is heavily dependent on negotiating an option agreement.
- Planning risk remains; approval is not guaranteed.
- Requires a longer timeline to realize profit (18-36 months).
- Identifying the correct owner and making contact can be time-consuming.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Execute the search to generate a list of target properties.
2.  **Qualify:** Triage the top 20 results, cross-referencing local plans for specific height policies or site allocations.
3.  **Approach:** Contact the property owners with a well-researched proposal for an option agreement, highlighting the potential value uplift from a new planning consent.
4.  **Secure:** Negotiate and sign an option agreement for a 24-month period, contingent on achieving planning.
5.  **Plan:** Appoint architects and planning consultants to design an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.
6.  **Exit:** Once planning is granted, sell the site with the benefit of the new consent to a major housebuilder or development fund for a significant profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee (2-5% of estimated land value): £40,000
- Planning Application & Consultant Fees: £25,000
- **Total:** £65,000

## Approach B: Airspace Development Over Commercial Hubs

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace Development - Flat Roof + Height Headroom)
**Capital Required:** £170,000 (Airspace Purchase & Design Fees)
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink]
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 750
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15
```

**Rationale:**
This is a sophisticated, capital-efficient strategy to replicate the precedent's density and mixed-use nature by building vertically on top of existing commercial properties. It leverages Pattern 6A by identifying low-rise, flat-roofed commercial buildings in transport-accessible areas. Building residential units above an existing commercial parade naturally creates the mixed-use (Class E/C3) environment of the precedent.

This approach is highly feasible within the £200k capital limit because we are not acquiring the entire property, but only the "airspace" rights to develop above the existing roof. Targeting freehold titles with no leaseholders simplifies the legal process immensely, as consent is only required from one party (the freeholder). The capital is used to purchase the rights and fund the design/planning phase.

**Strengths:**
- Extremely capital-efficient way to achieve high density.
- Bypasses land acquisition costs, which are often the largest expense.
- Creates the target mixed-use outcome organically.
- Locations near train stations are ideal for car-free residential development, strengthening the planning case.
- Faster construction potential as foundations and ground-floor structure are already in place.

**Limitations:**
- Requires specialist legal and structural engineering expertise.
- The existing building's foundation must be able to support additional floors, requiring intrusive surveys.
- Negotiation with the freeholder can be complex.
- Right of light issues for neighbouring properties can be a constraint.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the search to find suitable flat-roofed commercial properties.
2.  **Diligence:** Conduct initial desktop structural analysis and a site visit to assess feasibility.
3.  **Approach:** Contact the freeholder with a proposal to purchase the airspace rights for a residential development.
4.  **Secure:** Negotiate the purchase of the airspace, potentially offering the freeholder a share of the profit or a fixed sum.
5.  **Design & Plan:** Appoint a structural engineer and architect to design the vertical extension and submit a planning application.
6.  **Exit/Build:** Either sell the scheme with planning permission to a developer or secure development finance to build and sell the individual residential units.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Airspace Rights Acquisition Fee: £120,000
- Structural/Architectural/Planning Fees: £50,000
- **Total:** £170,000

## Approach C: EPC Arbitrage (Regulation-Driven)

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Pressure) and Pattern 2A (Motivated Seller)
**Capital Required:** £165,000 (Acquisition & Refurbishment)
**Expected Results:** 50-200 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. EPC rating: is one of [F, G]
2. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
4. Latest sold date: is before 2004-01-01
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
6. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
7. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach is completely different from the precedent and focuses on a high-volume, regulation-driven strategy. It exploits the 2020 Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) which make it illegal to rent out properties with an EPC rating of F or G. This regulation creates a highly motivated seller pool.

We target private owners (`Private owner`) who have held the property for over 20 years (`Latest sold date: is before 2004-01-01`), as they are the classic "tired landlord" demographic least likely to have the capital or inclination to perform the required upgrades (Pattern 8C & 2A). By setting a price cap of £150,000, we can acquire the property directly within our £200,000 capital outlay, use the remainder for a basic refurbishment to improve the EPC rating, and then sell the now-compliant property on the open market for a profit.

**Strengths:**
- Exploits a hard, non-negotiable regulatory deadline, creating strong seller motivation.
- Targets a specific, well-understood "tired landlord" demographic.
- Capital-feasible for direct acquisition and refurbishment within the £200k budget.
- Faster turnaround time (6-9 months) compared to development projects.
- Lower risk profile than development; the asset is a standard residential house.

**Limitations:**
- Profit per unit is much lower than a development project.
- Requires a higher volume of deals to reach the £2M target profit.
- Competition from other small-scale investors and builders.
- Refurbishment costs can sometimes exceed budget if unforeseen issues arise.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the search to generate a list of on-market, non-compliant properties.
2.  **Analyze:** Quickly assess the top 10-15 listings, reviewing the EPC report to understand the required upgrades (e.g., insulation, new boiler, windows).
3.  **Offer:** Make offers on multiple properties, factoring in a £15k-£20k budget for refurbishment. The negotiation position is strong due to the property's illegal rental status.
4.  **Acquire:** Purchase the property using the available capital.
5.  **Refurbish:** Immediately undertake the necessary works to improve the EPC rating to at least a 'D' or 'C'.
6.  **Exit:** Relist the compliant property on the market for a quick sale to first-time buyers or other buy-to-let investors.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition Price: £145,000
- Refurbishment Costs (to improve EPC): £15,000
- Stamp Duty/Legal Fees: £5,000
- **Total:** £165,000

### Grok_Approaches

### Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone (FILTER_PATTERNS.md - High-Density/Intensification Strategies)

**Capital Required:** £150,000-£180,000 (within £200k limit)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (narrow focus on Slough and nearby areas with similar development potential)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
2. Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
10. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets properties similar to the approved Slough 8-storey mixed-use development by focusing on sites with existing mixed-use (E and C3) potential, low-rise buildings in high-accessibility areas (PTAL 4+ or near train stations), and minimal planning constraints. The precedent shows successful approval for tall mixed-use in Slough, so we replicate by finding comparable sites with stalled or no recent planning activity, allowing us to apply for similar schemes. Capital is kept low by targeting smaller plots (0.5-2 acres) suitable for phased development, aiming for £2M profit through planning uplift and resale.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching to the Slough approval, increasing planning success likelihood
- High-density potential in transport-accessible areas, aligning with local policy support
- Narrow geographic focus reduces competition and improves result quality
- Combines multiple signals (use class, height, accessibility) for precise targeting

**Limitations:**
- PTAL limited to London/TfL areas; may need to substitute with train station proximity for non-London
- Requires local planning expertise to adapt the Slough precedent
- Smaller plot sizes may limit scale compared to the 8-storey target
- Dependent on market demand for mixed-use in similar locations

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run the filter to identify 10-30 sites in Slough and nearby (e.g., within 5-10 miles).
2. Manually review planning history for each site to confirm no recent tall building applications.
3. Approach owners with the Slough precedent as proof of viability, offering option agreements (£10k-£20k) to secure sites.
4. Engage a planning consultant to prepare applications mirroring the approved scheme.
5. Phase development: Secure planning first, then sell to housebuilder or developer for profit realization.
6. Monitor for fresh planning approvals in the area to refine targeting.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option agreements and legal fees: £20,000
- Planning application and consultant fees: £50,000
- Site surveys and due diligence: £10,000
- Marketing and negotiation costs: £10,000
- Contingency buffer: £10,000
- **Total:** £100,000 (well within £200k, allowing for phased capital deployment)

### Approach B: Low-Capital Derelict Turnaround

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4C: Derelict Asset Turnaround (FILTER_PATTERNS.md - Low Capital Entry Strategies)

**Capital Required:** £120,000-£160,000 (within £200k limit)

**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (broader search for distressed assets across UK)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
7. Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
8. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
9. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
```

**Rationale:**
This non-precedent-based approach exploits motivated sellers with derelict properties in transport-accessible areas, focusing on low-capital acquisitions under £150k. Unlike the Slough precedent, it targets distressed assets for quick turnaround (demolish/rebuild) rather than planning-intensive schemes, aiming for £2M profit through multiple smaller deals (e.g., buy £100k, rebuild £100k, sell £300k each). It uses regulation-driven motivation (derelict status often tied to compliance issues) and time arbitrage (long-hold owners), with no reliance on specific planning precedents.

**Strengths:**
- Low entry capital allows multiple acquisitions within £200k budget
- Derelict status creates strong seller motivation (asset write-down, compliance pressure)
- Transport proximity ensures exit viability for residential redevelopment
- Broad UK scope increases opportunity pool compared to geographic-specific precedents

**Limitations:**
- Derelict properties may have hidden structural issues requiring additional costs
- Planning for rebuild may face local opposition despite unconstrained sites
- Smaller plot sizes limit profit per deal, requiring volume strategy
- Competition from other distressed asset buyers in accessible areas

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run the filter to identify 20-50 derelict sites across the UK, prioritizing those near train stations.
2. Conduct quick site visits to assess rebuild potential and hidden costs.
3. Negotiate direct purchases or options (£5k-£10k) with motivated owners, emphasizing quick cash offers.
4. Secure planning for residential rebuild (often straightforward on unconstrained sites).
5. Execute demolish/rebuild in phases, selling completed units for profit.
6. Scale by repeating the process across multiple sites for cumulative £2M target.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition costs (multiple sites at £50k-£100k each): £100,000
- Demolition and initial rebuild setup: £30,000
- Planning and legal fees: £15,000
- Due diligence and surveys: £10,000
- Contingency for repairs: £5,000
- **Total:** £160,000 (within £200k, scalable across deals)
