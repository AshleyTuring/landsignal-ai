Based on the disagreement analysis, I have reconsidered my original assessments. My updated positions are grounded in the provided reference materials and a stricter interpretation of technical and business case viability.

### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**

*   **Codex Approach B (HMO Conversion):** Was **INVALID** (for multiple technical reasons), now my reasoning is corrected.
    *   **Reasoning for Change:** My original critique incorrectly stated that the `Article 4 Direction:` filter was non-existent. This was a factual error. The `SearchLand Available Filters.md` reference confirms an `Article 4` filter does exist. My assessment was flawed.
    *   **Revised Assessment:** The approach remains **INVALID**, but for different reasons. The prompt still contains multiple critical errors: an invalid value for `Property type` (`Residential`), incorrect operator for `Tenure`, and an invalid date format. Furthermore, regarding the business case, I now concur with Claude's assessment: an HMO rental-yield strategy is a fundamental strategic misalignment for a £2M capital gain objective derived from a £200k seed, as it would require an unrealistic scale of operations and leverage.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**

*   **Gemini Approach C (EPC Arbitrage):** Still **VALID**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The disagreement here is philosophical. My position remains that a high-volume, "trading" strategy is a legitimate business model to achieve a capital gain target. While Claude correctly identifies it as a different *type* of strategy from large-scale development, it is not inherently misaligned with the financial goal of realizing £2M in profit. The prompt is technically flawless and the business model is sound.

*   **Claude Approach D (High-PTAL London):** Still **CONDITIONAL**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The disagreement is on interpreting budget constraints. I maintain that identifying a capital need (£225k) slightly above the stated budget (£200k) and explicitly proposing a joint venture (JV) to bridge the gap is a sign of a mature, realistic business case, not a fatal flaw. The approach is rightly conditional on securing that partner. Rejecting it outright would be to ignore standard real estate financing structures.

*   **Codex Approach A & C:** Both still **INVALID**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The consensus is clear and my original assessment holds. Approach A uses an invalid `Property type` value ('Mixed Use'). Approach C uses the wrong units for `Title area` ('sqft' instead of 'acres'). Both are critical, unrecoverable technical errors.

**Clarifications:**

1.  **On Business Case: Volume/Yield vs. Large-Scale Development:** My assessments treat any strategy that feasibly generates the target capital gain as valid, whether through a single large project or high-volume trading (e.g., EPC arbitrage). I acknowledge these are different business models with different risk and operational profiles. My `VALID` rating confirms the model's soundness, not necessarily its suitability for a user who may implicitly prefer a single, large development project.

2.  **On Factual Correctness (Article 4 Filter):** I retract my previous assertion that the `Article 4` filter does not exist. It was a factual error based on incomplete knowledge, which I have now corrected by reviewing the provided documentation. My process has been updated to more rigorously verify filter existence against the `SearchLand Available Filters.md` document before declaring a filter non-existent.
