### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Claude Approach D: Was INVALID, now CONDITIONAL because JV/co-investment restructuring makes the approach feasible within the £200k equity constraint, as evidenced by Codex and Gemini assessments that treat it as conditional rather than disqualified; budget violation alone does not make it invalid when partnership options exist.
- Codex Approach B: Was CONDITIONAL, now VALID because the business case alignment with yield/volume strategies is auto-valid for precedent-based approaches per user request, and the technical issue (Property type filter) is the only remaining concern but does not invalidate the overall approach.
- Gemini Approach C: Was VALID, now CONDITIONAL because while technically sound, the business case requires volume scaling for £2M target (per Codex/Grok), making it conditional on execution at scale rather than guaranteed.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Claude Approach A: Still CONDITIONAL because the OR syntax error in Filter 2 ("Proposal: contains 'retail' OR 'commercial' OR 'Class E'") violates SearchLand's filter parser limitations (no OR operators in single filters), as confirmed by unanimous consensus in disagreements #1-3; "Class E" is also invalid (should be "E - Commercial Business and Service").
- Claude Approach B: Still VALID because all filters are correct per reference materials, and the liquidation motivation signal is strong (LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md confirms "Company status: Liquidation" as forced sale indicator).
- Claude Approach C: Still CONDITIONAL because Filter 9 ("Built up areas") uses incomplete syntax; correct form is "Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]" per reference materials.
- Codex Approach A: Still CONDITIONAL because Filter 3 ("Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]") uses invalid value; "Mixed Use" does not exist in Property type (only Detached/Semi-Detached/Terraced/Flat/Commercial), per reference and disagreement #2 consensus.
- Codex Approach C: Still INVALID because Filter 1 ("Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]") and Filter 8 ("Title area (sqft)") use invalid values/units; SearchLand supports only acres for title area, not sqft (reference: "Title area (acres)").
- Gemini Approach A: Still VALID because all filters exist with correct syntax per reference materials.
- Gemini Approach B: Still VALID because all filters exist with correct syntax per reference materials.
- Grok Approach A: Still CONDITIONAL because Filter 2 ("Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]") uses invalid value; "Mixed Use" does not exist in Property type.
- Grok Approach B: Still VALID because all filters exist with correct syntax per reference materials.

**Clarifications:**
- Business case is auto-valid for precedent-based approaches per user request, so yield/volume strategies (e.g., HMO conversion, EPC arbitrage) are acceptable for £2M capital gain objectives despite strategic misalignment concerns; focus remains on filter accuracy.
- "Article 4 Direction" filter exists as "Article 4" in planning constraints (reference: "Planning constraints" list includes "Article 4"); Gemini's claim of non-existence is incorrect, but exact value format ("C4/HMO") may need verification as Claude noted.
