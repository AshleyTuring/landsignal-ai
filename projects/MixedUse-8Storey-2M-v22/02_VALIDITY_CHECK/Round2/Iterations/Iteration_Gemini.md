### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- **Gemini Approach C (EPC Arbitrage):** Was `CONDITIONAL (Strategically)`, now `INVALID`. The core user objective is to deliver a large-scale mixed-use *development*, not just to achieve a £2M profit target. This approach, which requires flipping 60-80 properties, is a high-volume trading strategy. It is fundamentally misaligned with the requested project *type* and operational model, as noted by Grok. A valid approach must match both the financial and strategic goals.
- **Grok Approach B (Derelict Turnaround):** Was `CONDITIONAL (Strategically)`, now `INVALID`. Similar to Gemini C, this is a volume-based strategy requiring 3-5 separate deals to achieve the £2M profit target. The user's request was premised on a single large-scale development precedent. A multi-site strategy represents a different business model and does not meet the implicit "single project" constraint.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- **Claude Approach D (High-PTAL London):** Still `INVALID`. The approach requires £225k in equity, which exceeds the user's stated hard constraint of £200k in *solo* capital. Suggesting a JV restructure is a modification of the core constraints, not a solution within them. A proposal that fails a hard budget constraint is not `CONDITIONAL`; it is `INVALID`.
- **Gemini Approach A (Precedent-Driven Intensification):** Still `VALID`. It remains the only technically flawless approach that is fully aligned with the user's strategic and financial objectives.
- **Claude Approach A, B, C & Gemini Approach B:** Still `CONDITIONAL`. These represent sound strategies but contain specific, correctable technical syntax errors in their SearchLand prompts. They are not `INVALID` because the underlying logic is viable, pending minor corrections.
- **Codex Approach A, B, C & Grok Approach A:** Still `INVALID`. These contain critical, multi-faceted technical errors (e.g., using London-only filters outside London, fatal unit mismatches, multiple invalid values) that render the prompts non-functional and demonstrate a misunderstanding of the filtering system.

**Clarifications:**
- The distinction between `CONDITIONAL` and `INVALID` is critical. An approach is `CONDITIONAL` if its strategy is sound but has correctable technical flaws (e.g., syntax errors). An approach is `INVALID` if it fails a hard constraint (e.g., budget), relies on non-existent filters for its core logic, or proposes a business model fundamentally misaligned with the user's stated project type (e.g., volume trading vs. large-scale development).
- My initial assessment was insufficiently strict on strategic alignment. A technically perfect prompt that pursues the wrong goal is not a `CONDITIONAL` success; it is a failure to meet the brief. I have now corrected this.
