### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Claude Approach D (High-PTAL London): Was INVALID, now CONDITIONAL because capital violation can be addressed via JV partnership restructuring to reduce equity requirement below £200k, as evidenced by Codex's analysis showing this as a viable fix rather than an absolute disqualification.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Claude Approach A (Slough Precedent Replication): Still CONDITIONAL because OR syntax and boolean errors are confirmed technical issues per unanimous LLM consensus in disagreement analysis, requiring fixes for execution.
- Claude Approach B (Liquidation Arbitrage): Still CONDITIONAL because boolean syntax error is confirmed per multiple LLMs (Claude, Gemini, Grok), preventing proper filter execution.
- Claude Approach C (Legacy Holdings Conversion): Still CONDITIONAL because "No latest sold date" filter non-existence is confirmed by all 4 LLMs as invalid, requiring proxy workaround.
- Codex Approach A (Slough Mid-Rise Intensification): Still CONDITIONAL because invalid "Mixed Use" property type value is confirmed by all 4 LLMs, and boolean syntax error by multiple LLMs.
- Codex Approach B (Large C3 to HMO Conversion): Still INVALID because strategic misalignment (yield vs development) is confirmed, combined with multiple technical errors (invalid property type, date format, filter name).
- Codex Approach C (Brand Covenant Expiry Reposition): Still INVALID because critical units error (sqft vs acres) is confirmed by all 4 LLMs, plus multiple other technical errors.
- Gemini Approach A (Precedent-Driven Intensification): Still VALID because no technical issues identified and consensus agrees on correctness.
- Gemini Approach B (Airspace Development): Still CONDITIONAL because boolean syntax error is confirmed by multiple LLMs (Claude, Gemini, Grok).
- Gemini Approach C (EPC Arbitrage): Still INVALID because strategic misalignment (trading vs development) persists despite technical validity, and while some LLMs marked CONDITIONAL, precedent-based business case auto-validity doesn't apply here as this is regulation-driven trading, not precedent replication.
- Grok Approach A (Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication): Still CONDITIONAL because invalid "Mixed Use" property type is confirmed by all 4 LLMs, and PTAL geography limitation noted.
- Grok Approach B (Low-Capital Derelict Turnaround): Still CONDITIONAL because date format error is confirmed, and volume strategy requires user approval per disagreement analysis.

**Clarifications:**
- Strategic alignment for volume strategies (e.g., Grok B, Gemini C): These remain CONDITIONAL rather than INVALID because they achieve the £2M profit objective through multiple smaller deals, but require explicit user confirmation of volume approach preference over single large development, as evidenced by disagreement analysis showing majority view them as user-decision dependent.
- Capital feasibility (Claude D): Changed assessment to CONDITIONAL based on evidence that JV restructuring can address budget overruns, making it fixable rather than disqualifying, per Codex's position in disagreement analysis.
- Boolean syntax validation completeness: Codex's missed errors in some approaches (e.g., Claude A) represent inconsistent application rather than factual disagreement, but don't change assessments as the errors were still caught by majority consensus.
- Filter accuracy focus: For precedent-based approaches (Claude A, Codex A, Grok A), business case remains auto-valid per user request, with focus solely on technical filter corrections as evidenced by consensus on syntax, units, and existence issues.
