## ALL APPROACHES TO REVIEW (Original Generation)

### Claude_Approaches

Based on my comprehensive analysis of your requirements, reference materials, and strategic patterns, I'll generate **4 unique property search strategies** that cover:

1. **Precedent-based** approaches (replicating the Slough 8-storey mixed-use approval)
2. **Motivation-driven** approaches (behavioral arbitrage)
3. **Capital-efficient** structures (within £200k budget)
4. **Strategic diversity** across multiple angles

---

## Approach A: Slough Precedent Replication - Stalled Mixed-Use with Height Approval

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A (Expired/Stalled Planning) + Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreement or distressed purchase)  
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties (highly targeted)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial" OR "Class E"
3. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
4. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
8. Building on title is inactive: Yes
9. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
10. Sales listing price: is less than 250000
```

### Rationale:

This approach **replicates the Slough precedent** by finding sites with:
- **Similar planning history:** Previous mixed-use proposals with multiple storeys (filters 1-2)
- **Current under-development:** <4 floors existing = intensification potential (filter 3)
- **Stalled planning:** Last application 2+ years ago, <3 apps in 5 years (filters 4-5)
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m train station supports density policy (filter 6)
- **Appropriate size:** 0.15-1.5 acres = 6,500-65,000 sqft (similar to Slough site) (filter 7)
- **Inactive buildings:** Derelict/unused = motivated seller signal (filter 8)
- **Active listings:** On market + price capped at £250k (filters 9-10)

**Planning Precedent Logic:**  
The Slough approval demonstrates that 8-storey mixed-use (retail ground floor + residential above) is achievable in transport-accessible locations. This filter finds similar sites where:
- Planning was previously attempted (demonstrates developer interest)
- Applications have stalled (opportunity for you to revive)
- Current low-rise = intensification upside
- Listed for sale = motivated seller

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Proven precedent:** 8-storey mixed-use approved in Slough = replicable
- ✅ **Planning de-risked:** Similar proposals already attempted (shows viability)
- ✅ **Motivated sellers:** Stalled planning + inactive building + on market
- ✅ **Transport policy support:** <800m train = density-friendly planning context
- ✅ **Capital-efficient:** £50k-£250k acquisition, option agreements possible
- ✅ **High profit potential:** Low-rise to 8-storey = 4-6x floor area increase

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Why did planning stall?** Must investigate refusal reasons (if applicable)
- ⚠️ **Market listings = competitive:** Other buyers may be circling
- ⚠️ **£250k cap = limited pool:** May exclude larger/better sites
- ⚠️ **"Inactive" filter restrictive:** Could miss occupied buildings with potential
- ⚠️ **Transport dependency:** <800m train station excludes some viable sites

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Site Identification (Week 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Review each property's planning history on Local Planning Authority (LPA) website
3. Identify refusal reasons (if refused) or expiry circumstances (if lapsed)
4. Shortlist sites where planning failure was addressable (design, affordable housing %, etc.)

**Phase 2: Precedent Research (Week 2-3)**
5. For each shortlisted site, search LPA for similar approved schemes within 500m
6. Document precedents: height approved, unit mix, density, S106 obligations
7. Assess policy context: Is LPA pro-growth? Housing delivery test failed? (motivation to approve)

**Phase 3: Owner Outreach (Week 3-4)**
8. Contact owners directly (Land Registry title search for details)
9. Approach: "I've identified planning potential on your site. Would you consider an option agreement?"
10. Negotiate option: £10k-£50k fee, 12-24 month term, planning-contingent

**Phase 4: Planning Strategy (Month 2-12)**
11. Engage planning consultant (£20k-£50k for pre-app + submission)
12. Pre-application advice from LPA (de-risk before formal submission)
13. Address previous refusal reasons (if applicable)
14. Submit planning application (£10k-£30k fees depending on size)

**Phase 5: Exit (Month 12-18)**
15. **Option 1 - Sell with planning:** Exit to housebuilder at 40-50% of GDV (£2M+ profit if successful)
16. **Option 2 - Sell option:** Sell option to developer for £100k-£500k (lower profit, faster exit)
17. **Option 3 - JV with housebuilder:** Contribute land, they fund build, split profit 30/70

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Site option agreement:** £10k-£50k
- **Legal fees (option):** £3k-£8k
- **Planning consultant:** £20k-£50k
- **Planning application fees:** £10k-£30k
- **Ground investigation/surveys:** £5k-£15k
- **Contingency (10%):** £5k-£15k
- **Total:** £53k-£168k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit:

- **Scenario 1 (Slough replication):** 8-storey, 40 units, £400k/unit GDV = £16M GDV
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,000/sqm × 3,000sqm) = £6M
- **Less:** S106/CIL = £2M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £1M
- **Residual land value:** £7M
- **Your profit (if sell with planning at 50% RLV):** £3.5M
- **Less your costs:** £168k
- **Net profit:** £3.3M ✅ **Exceeds £2M target**

---

## Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales with Development Potential

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales) + Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (distressed pricing + legal)  
**Expected Results:** 5-20 properties (very targeted, high motivation)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 5
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, Outside of the defined classes]
6. Building on title is derelict: Yes
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **FORCED SELLERS** - companies in liquidation with development-potential assets:

- **Liquidation = maximum motivation:** Legal obligation to sell (filter 1-2)
- **Developable size:** 0.2-5 acres = 8,700-217,800 sqft (meaningful projects) (filter 3)
- **Transport accessibility:** <1km train supports residential conversion/mixed-use (filter 4)
- **Commercial/industrial use:** E/B2/B8/Sui Generis = conversion opportunities (filter 5)
- **Derelict buildings:** Double motivation (cannot generate income) (filter 6)
- **Clean planning:** Excludes major blockers (filter 7)
- **70%+ unconstrained:** Developable land (filter 8)

**Behavioral Economics Logic:**  
Liquidators are motivated by:
1. **Speed:** Must complete sales quickly (creditor pressure)
2. **Certainty:** Cash buyers preferred (no financing contingencies)
3. **Below-market pricing:** Discounts of 20-40% common in forced sales
4. **Clear decision-maker:** Liquidator has authority (no emotional attachment)

This creates a **buyer's market** where you have negotiating leverage.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **VERY strong motivation:** Forced sale = legal obligation
- ✅ **Below-market pricing:** Liquidation sales typically 20-40% discount
- ✅ **Speed advantage:** Liquidators prioritize fast completion
- ✅ **Clear decision-maker:** No emotional attachment, professional seller
- ✅ **Conversion opportunities:** Commercial/industrial → residential/mixed-use
- ✅ **Double motivation:** Liquidation + derelict = maximum urgency
- ✅ **Low competition:** Many buyers avoid liquidation complexity

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Very limited pool:** Liquidations are rare (5-20 results expected)
- ⚠️ **Legal complexity:** May have creditor claims, liens, environmental liabilities
- ⚠️ **Unknown condition:** Derelict buildings may have structural issues
- ⚠️ **Timeline pressure:** Liquidator may accept first reasonable offer (act fast)
- ⚠️ **Planning uncertainty:** Conversion not guaranteed (especially B2/B8 in some LPAs)

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Rapid Response (Week 1)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Identify liquidator contact (Companies House, Land Registry)
3. **Same-day outreach:** Call liquidator within 24 hours of discovery
4. Position: "Cash buyer, 4-week completion, no financing contingency"

**Phase 2: Due Diligence (Week 1-3)**
5. Fast-track title search (Land Registry - £7, 24hr turnaround)
6. Desktop environmental assessment (Phase 1 - £2k-£5k)
7. Review creditor claims (Companies House records)
8. Structural survey (derelict buildings - £3k-£8k)
9. Planning pre-app (informal discussion with LPA - £0-£1k)

**Phase 3: Negotiation (Week 2-4)**
10. Offer 60-70% of market value (liquidator will negotiate)
11. Highlight: Speed, certainty, cash, no contingencies
12. Lock in exclusivity (7-14 days) with £5k-£10k deposit
13. Agree 4-6 week completion (faster = better price)

**Phase 4: Acquisition (Week 4-6)**
14. Exchange contracts (solicitor fees £5k-£10k)
15. Complete purchase (cash payment or bridging finance)
16. Secure site (insurance, security, make safe)

**Phase 5: Exit (Month 3-18)**
17. **Option 1 - Quick flip:** Sell to developer immediately (10-30% profit, 3-6 months)
18. **Option 2 - Planning gain:** Apply for planning, sell with consent (50-100% profit, 12-18 months)
19. **Option 3 - JV:** Partner with developer (land contribution, they build, split profit)

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Site acquisition:** £80k-£120k (distressed pricing)
- **Legal fees:** £5k-£10k
- **Due diligence:** £8k-£15k (surveys, environmental, title)
- **Make safe/security:** £2k-£5k
- **Planning pre-app/advice:** £5k-£10k
- **Contingency (10%):** £10k-£16k
- **Total:** £110k-£176k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit:

**Scenario 1: Quick flip (no planning)**
- Acquisition: £100k (below market)
- Market value (as-is): £150k
- Sell to developer: £130k-£140k
- Net profit: £20k-£30k (3-6 months)
- **ROI:** 20-30% in <6 months ⚠️ Below £2M target but fast capital recycling

**Scenario 2: Planning gain (residential conversion)**
- Acquisition: £100k
- Planning costs: £30k-£60k
- Market value with consent: £500k-£1M (depending on units approved)
- Sell at 70% of market: £350k-£700k
- Less costs: £130k-£160k
- Net profit: £220k-£570k (12-18 months)
- **ROI:** 140-360% ⚠️ Still below £2M target but excellent return

**Scenario 3: Portfolio strategy (multiple sites)**
- Repeat process 3-5 times with £200k capital (recycled)
- Average profit per site: £200k-£400k
- Total profit (3-5 sites over 18-24 months): £600k-£2M ✅ **Can hit £2M target with volume**

---

## Approach C: Legacy Holdings Conversion - Off-Market Mixed-Use Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings) + Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + Accessibility)  
**Capital Required:** £10k-£50k (option agreements, patient capital)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (relationship-based sourcing)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. No latest sold date
2. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
3. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
7. Developed area percentage: is less than 40
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Built up areas
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **INHERITED/LEGACY PROPERTIES** with patient, relationship-based sourcing:

- **Never sold:** No Land Registry sale record = inherited/very long hold (filter 1)
- **Private owner:** Non-professional, may not know development value (filter 2)
- **No planning activity:** <1 app in 5 years = passive holding (filter 3)
- **Development-scale:** 0.25-2 acres = meaningful mixed-use projects (filter 4)
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m train = supports 8-storey policy (filter 5)
- **Flexible use:** E/B2/B8/C3 = multiple conversion routes (filter 6)
- **Under-developed:** <40% developed = land value play (filter 7)
- **Clean planning:** Excludes major constraints (filter 8)
- **Urban context:** Built-up areas = residential policy support (filter 9)

**Behavioral Arbitrage Logic:**  
Owners of never-sold properties often:
1. **Don't know current value:** Inherited decades ago, no recent valuation
2. **Estate planning motivation:** Elderly owners looking to liquidate
3. **Tax liability concerns:** CGT on development gain, prefer to sell land
4. **Non-professional:** Not developers, don't understand planning potential
5. **Off-market:** Not actively marketed (no agent competition)

This creates **information asymmetry** - you know the development potential, they don't.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Off-market opportunities:** No listing = no competition
- ✅ **Information advantage:** You know development potential, owner doesn't
- ✅ **Patient capital:** Low upfront cost (option agreements £10k-£50k)
- ✅ **Relationship-based:** Build trust, win-win outcomes (fair price for owner, upside for you)
- ✅ **Multiple exit routes:** E/B2/B8/C3 all have conversion precedents
- ✅ **Urban context:** Built-up areas + transport = planning-friendly
- ✅ **No active developers:** 0 apps in 5 years = no competition from other developers

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **Time-intensive:** Relationship building takes 3-6 months per owner
- ⚠️ **Low volume:** May only yield 10-30 leads, not all convert
- ⚠️ **Owner hard to locate:** "No sold date" = pre-digital records, contact info may be outdated
- ⚠️ **Emotional attachment:** Family holdings may have sentimental value (resistance to sell)
- ⚠️ **Planning risk:** No recent applications = no validated planning potential

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Targeted Sourcing (Month 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Land Registry title search for owner details (£7/title, 300 titles = £2,100)
3. Cross-reference with Electoral Roll, Companies House (find contact info)
4. Create property dossiers: photos, planning policy analysis, precedent research

**Phase 2: Outreach Campaign (Month 2-4)**
5. **Personalized letters:** Not generic direct mail - reference specific property, local precedents
6. Follow-up calls (2-3 weeks after letter)
7. **Value proposition:** "I specialize in helping landowners unlock planning potential. Would you consider an option agreement where I fund planning, you retain ownership, we share upside?"
8. **Education:** Explain development potential, show comparable sales, demonstrate value

**Phase 3: Relationship Building (Month 3-6)**
9. Meet owners in person (site visits, coffee meetings)
10. Build trust: Professional, transparent, fair
11. Address concerns: "You keep ownership, no risk, I fund planning, we split profit 40/60"
12. Introduce to planning consultant (credibility)

**Phase 4: Option Agreements (Month 6-12)**
13. Negotiate option terms:
    - Option fee: £10k-£50k (non-refundable, against purchase price)
    - Term: 18-24 months (time to secure planning)
    - Strike price: £500k-£2M (fair market value for current use)
    - Overage: 30-40% of uplift (planning gain split)
14. Legal documentation (solicitor £5k-£10k)
15. Exercise conditions: Planning consent granted

**Phase 5: Planning & Exit (Month 12-30)**
16. Apply for planning (8-storey mixed-use, residential conversion, etc.)
17. **Exit Option 1:** Sell option to developer (£100k-£500k profit, fast)
18. **Exit Option 2:** Exercise option, sell with planning (£1M-£3M+ profit, slower)
19. **Exit Option 3:** JV with developer (land + planning, split build profit)

### Capital Breakdown (Per Site):

- **Land Registry searches:** £2k-£3k (300 titles)
- **Planning consultant (pre-app):** £10k-£20k
- **Option fee (per site):** £10k-£50k
- **Legal fees (option agreement):** £5k-£10k
- **Outreach/marketing:** £2k-£5k (letters, calls, site visits)
- **Contingency (10%):** £3k-£9k
- **Total per site:** £32k-£97k
- **Portfolio (2-3 sites):** £64k-£194k ✅ **Within £200k budget**

### Expected Profit (Per Site):

**Scenario 1: Sell option (no planning)**
- Option fee invested: £30k
- Sell option to developer: £100k-£300k
- Net profit: £70k-£270k (12-18 months)
- **ROI:** 230-900% per site

**Scenario 2: Exercise option + sell with planning**
- Option fee: £30k
- Planning costs: £50k-£80k
- Strike price: £1M (pay owner)
- Market value with planning: £3M-£5M (8-storey mixed-use)
- Sell at 60% of market: £1.8M-£3M
- Less costs: £1.08M-£1.11M
- Net profit: £690k-£1.89M (24-36 months)
- **ROI:** 638-1,750% per site ✅ **Single site can hit £2M target**

**Scenario 3: Portfolio (3 sites)**
- Average profit per site (sell options): £150k
- Total profit (3 sites): £450k (18-24 months)
- **Plus:** 1 site with planning exercise: +£1.5M
- **Total portfolio profit:** £1.95M ✅ **Close to £2M target**

## Approach D: High-PTAL Low-Rise Intensification - London Tall Building Zones

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) + Pattern 3A (Development Opportunity)  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£200k (deposit/option for higher-value sites)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (London-focused, policy-supported)

### SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):

```
1. PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
2. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.2
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution, C3 - Dwellinghouses, Outside of the defined classes]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Green Belt]
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
7. Developed area percentage: is greater than 20 AND less than 60
8. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
9. Sales listing price: is less than 2000000
```

### Rationale:

This approach targets **TALL BUILDING POLICY SUPPORT** in London's highest-accessibility zones:

- **Excellent transport:** PTAL 5-6b = London's best-connected areas (filter 1)
- **Low-rise existing:** <4 floors = intensification opportunity (filter 2)
- **Development-scale:** 0.15-1.2 acres = 6,500-52,000 sqft (suitable for 8-storey) (filter 3)
- **Flexible use:** E/B2/B8/C3/Sui Generis = multiple routes to residential (filter 4)
- **Clean heritage:** No conservation/listed constraints (filter 5)
- **75%+ unconstrained:** Developable (filter 6)
- **Partially developed:** 20-60% = existing use (income during planning) but land for intensification (filter 7)
- **Active market:** On-market listings (filter 8)
- **Capital-efficient:** <£2M price (deposit £200k + debt financing) (filter 9)

**Planning Policy Logic:**  
London's tall building policies (London Plan 2021) explicitly support height in:
- **PTAL 4-6:** High transport accessibility
- **Opportunity Areas:** Designated growth zones
- **Town centres:** Commercial intensification

This filter finds **policy-backed intensification opportunities** where 8-storey is defensible.

### Strengths:

- ✅ **Planning policy support:** PTAL 5-6b = tall building policy zones
- ✅ **London precedents:** Many 8-storey+ approvals in PTAL 5-6b areas
- ✅ **Existing use value:** 20-60% developed = income during planning (reduces hold cost)
- ✅ **Multiple conversion routes:** E/B2/B8/C3 all viable in London
- ✅ **Higher land values:** London = higher residual values (supports £2M profit target)
- ✅ **Active market:** On-market listings = immediate availability
- ✅ **Clean title:** 75%+ unconstrained = fewer planning obstacles

### Limitations:

- ⚠️ **London-specific:** PTAL only in TfL area (excludes rest of UK)
- ⚠️ **Higher acquisition cost:** £1M-£2M price requires debt (£200k deposit + £1.8M loan)
- ⚠️ **Competition:** On-market listings = other buyers bidding
- ⚠️ **Planning risk:** Tall building policies have local opposition risk
- ⚠️ **S106/CIL costs:** London = high affordable housing % (35-50%) and CIL

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Site Filtering (Week 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter, export results
2. Overlay with London Plan Opportunity Areas map (GLA website)
3. Prioritize sites in:
   - Opportunity Areas (growth zones)
   - Town centres (commercial intensification)
   - Areas with recent 8-storey+ approvals (precedent)
4. Shortlist 10-15 sites with strongest planning case

**Phase 2: Planning Viability (Week 2-4)**
5. Review local plan policies (each London borough has tall building policy)
6. Search planning portal for nearby precedents (8-storey+ approvals within 500m)
7. Assess precedent quality:
   - Similar height? ✅
   - Similar use (mixed-use)? ✅
   - Recent approval (last 3 years)? ✅
   - Consistent with local policy? ✅
8. Desktop viability assessment (£20k-£40k planning consultant)

**Phase 3: Financing (Week 3-6)**
9. Approach development finance brokers (bridging loan + planning exit)
10. Structure: £200k equity + £1.8M debt (max £2M acquisition)
11. Debt terms: 18-24 month bridge, 1-2% monthly interest, planning exit refinance
12. Pre-approval (conditional on site acquisition)

**Phase 4: Acquisition (Month 2-3)**
13. Make offer (£1.5M-£1.8M, allowing £200k buffer for costs)
14. Due diligence: Title, surveys, planning pre-app (£15k-£30k)
15. Exchange with 10% deposit (£150k-£180k)
16. Complete with debt drawdown

**Phase 5: Planning (Month 3-18)**
17. Engage London planning specialist (£40k-£80k full service)
18. Pre-application with LPA (£5k-£10k fee, 2-3 meetings)
19. Design: 8-storey mixed-use, ground floor retail/E, upper floors residential
20. Target: 30-50 units (depending on site size)
21. S106 negotiation: Affordable housing %, CIL, public realm
22. Submit application (£20k-£50k fee)
23. Target approval: 12-15 months

**Phase 6: Exit (Month 15-24)**
24. **Exit Option 1:** Sell with planning to housebuilder (40-50% RLV)
25. **Exit Option 2:** JV with housebuilder (30% land, 70% build profit split)
26. **Exit Option 3:** Forward-fund with pension fund (pre-let, they fund build, fixed land payment)

### Capital Breakdown:

- **Deposit (10%):** £150k-£180k
- **Legal/surveys/due diligence:** £15k-£30k
- **Planning consultant:** £40k-£80k (spread over 12-18 months)
- **Planning fees:** £20k-£50k
- **Interest on debt (18 months @ 1.5%/month):** £486k-£583k (rolled into debt, paid at exit)
- **Total equity required:** £225k ⚠️ **Slightly over £200k budget** (can reduce by negotiating lower acquisition or using JV partner equity)

**Adjusted Capital Strategy (To Stay Within £200k):**
- Reduce acquisition target to £1.5M (£150k deposit)
- Co-invest with planning partner (50/50 equity split = £112.5k deposit)
- **Total your equity:** £112.5k deposit + £40k planning share = £152.5k ✅ **Within £200k**

### Expected Profit:

**Scenario 1: 8-storey mixed-use (40 units)**
- **GDV:** £500k/unit × 40 units = £20M
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,500/sqm × 4,000sqm) = £10M
- **Less:** S106/CIL (40% affordable + £2M CIL) = £4M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £1.5M
- **Residual land value:** £4.5M
- **Sell at 50% RLV:** £2.25M
- **Less:** Acquisition + debt repayment = £2M + £0.5M interest = £2.5M
- **Your profit (50% equity share):** (£2.25M - £2.5M) × 50% = -£125k ⚠️ **Loss scenario** (conservative)

**Scenario 2: Optimistic (50 units, lower build cost)**
- **GDV:** £500k/unit × 50 units = £25M
- **Less:** Build costs (£2,200/sqm × 5,000sqm) = £11M
- **Less:** S106/CIL = £5M
- **Less:** Professional fees/finance = £2M
- **Residual land value:** £7M
- **Sell at 50% RLV:** £3.5M
- **Less:** Acquisition + debt repayment = £2.5M
- **Your profit (50% equity share):** (£3.5M - £2.5M) × 50% = £500k ✅ **Profitable but below £2M target**

**Scenario 3: Portfolio (3 sites over 3 years)**
- Average profit per site: £500k
- Total profit: £1.5M (36 months)
- **Close to £2M target but requires recycling capital**

**Critical Issue with This Approach:**  
The profit margins are tight due to:
- High London land values
- High S106/CIL obligations (35-50% affordable housing)
- High build costs (£2,000-£2,500/sqm)

**This approach requires higher capital** than £200k to be viable, OR **a JV partner to share equity**.

## Summary & Recommendations

| Approach | Capital | Timeline | Expected Profit | Risk Level | Feasibility within £200k |
|----------|---------|----------|-----------------|------------|--------------------------|
| **A: Precedent Replication** | £53k-£168k | 12-18m | £2M-£3.5M | Medium | ✅ **Excellent** |
| **B: Liquidation Arbitrage** | £110k-£176k | 12-18m (portfolio) | £600k-£2M (volume) | Medium-High | ✅ **Good** (requires volume) |
| **C: Legacy Holdings** | £64k-£194k | 24-36m | £690k-£1.9M/site | Medium | ✅ **Excellent** (patient capital) |
| **D: High-PTAL Intensification** | £225k+ (or £152.5k with partner) | 15-24m | £500k-£1M/site | High | ⚠️ **Marginal** (needs JV partner) |

### My Recommendation: **Approach A + Approach C in Parallel**

**Why:**

1. **Approach A (Precedent Replication):**
   - Best fit for £200k capital (£53k-£168k)
   - Directly targets Slough precedent (8-storey mixed-use)
   - Highest profit potential (£2M-£3.5M per site)
   - 12-18 month timeline (reasonable)
   - Medium risk (planning precedent reduces uncertainty)

2. **Approach C (Legacy Holdings):**
   - Complementary strategy (relationship-based, off-market)
   - Low upfront capital (£10k-£50k per option)
   - Can pursue 2-3 sites in parallel
   - Longer timeline (24-36m) but very high ROI (£690k-£1.9M per site)
   - Builds pipeline for future projects

**Combined Strategy:**
- **Year 1:** Launch both approaches simultaneously
  - **Approach A:** Shortlist 5-10 stalled mixed-use sites, secure 1-2 options (£100k capital)
  - **Approach C:** Outreach to 50-100 legacy holdings, secure 2-3 options (£100k capital)
  - **Total capital deployed:** £200k
  
- **Year 2:** Execute planning on Approach A sites (fastest to market)
  - Exit 1 site with planning: **£2M-£3.5M profit** ✅ **Hits target**
  
- **Year 2-3:** Continue Approach C (longer-term, off-market plays)
  - Exit 1-2 sites with planning/options: **£1M-£2M additional profit**
  - **Total portfolio profit (3 years):** £3M-£5.5M

**Why NOT Approach B or D:**
- **Approach B (Liquidation):** Excellent strategy but very limited supply (5-20 sites) + requires volume to hit £2M (3-5 transactions)
- **Approach D (High-PTAL London):** Requires higher capital (£225k+ or JV partner) + tight profit margins due to London costs

### Codex_Approaches

## Approach A: Slough Mid-Rise Intensification (Precedent Match)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £180k (option + DD + planning)  
**Expected Results:** 12-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local planning authority: is equal to Slough
2. Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Property type: is one of [Mixed Use, Commercial]
4. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Max building height (m): is less than 12
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
9. Building on title is inactive: Yes
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
11. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Green Belt]
```

**Rationale:**
Targets Slough titles with existing E/C3 mix but sub-12m height and inactivity, matching the approved 8-storey mixed-use precedent. High-access sites within 800m of rail mirror Slough centre transport context. Unbroken freeholds remove assembly risk (Pattern 23A), while low app count surfaces fresh stock.

**Strengths:**
- Direct geographic precedent alignment (Slough + mixed-use + under-height)
- Single freehold simplifies negotiation and airspace/intensification
- Inactivity and low app count flag dormant value
- Rail proximity strengthens tall-building policy support
- Tight size band calibrated for 8-storey massing

**Limitations:**
- Slough-only may constrain volume
- Some mixed-use titles may already be income-productive (harder to buy)
- Station-proximate stock can price high
- Inactivity flag can include structurally poor assets
- Exclusion of constraints may miss viable conservation-edge plays

**Implementation Strategy:**
Sequence titles by station distance and roof condition; walk-by for roof/structure viability. Lead with option/subject-to-planning; anchor price to vacant value. Commission massing test + pre-app citing nearby 8-storey approval; emphasize uplift from sub-12m baseline. If retail leases exist, negotiate surrender aligned to planning grant.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Site option fee: £60k  
- Planning + pre-app + surveys: £45k  
- Legal + option structuring: £20k  
- Technical (massing, transport, utilities): £25k  
- Contingency: £30k  
- **Total:** £180k (≤£200k)


## Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (High Yield, Low Capital)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 22A: HMO Conversion + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £160k (deposit + works)  
**Expected Results:** 25-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is equal to Residential
2. Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
6. Sales listing price: is less than 300000
7. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
8. Latest sold date: is less than 2004
9. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
10. Article 4 Direction: does not contain [C4/HMO]
11. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:**
Targets large, legacy-held freehold houses (>2,000 sqft) under £300k with poor EPC and no HMO Article 4, ideal for high-yield conversion. Unbroken titles avoid leasehold complications; low planning activity and old sale dates signal disengaged owners.

**Strengths:**
- High margin uplift (5-8% HMO vs 3-4% BTL)
- Low entry price fits £200k capital with leverage
- EPC E-G enables price negotiation + grant leverage
- No Article 4 reduces change-of-use risk
- Legacy ownership improves off-market receptivity

**Limitations:**
- Article 4 coverage must be double-checked manually
- EPC upgrades add cost/time
- Some assets may need significant capex to HMO standards
- Valuers may downvalue in weaker rental micro-markets
- Planning/classification nuances if sui generis scale pursued

**Implementation Strategy:**
Target secondary towns with strong student/professional demand; validate no Article 4 at LPA level. Offer quick close; structure with bridge-to-term. Execute EPC uplift and internal replan to 6-8 beds; certify fire safety and licensing early.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- 25% deposit + fees on £280k buy: £80k  
- Conversion works + compliance: £55k  
- Professional fees (architect/MEP/fire): £10k  
- Licensing/EPC/contingency: £15k  
- **Total:** £160k (≤£200k)


## Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry Reposition (QSR/Retail to Mixed Use)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 20A: Brand Covenant Expiry + Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles  
**Capital Required:** £190k (option + DD)  
**Expected Results:** 10-20 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is one of [Commercial, Mixed Use]
2. Use class: contains any [E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, E(b) - Food and drink]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Lease end date (year): is less than 2027
6. Average daily footfall: is greater than 6000
7. Max building height (m): is less than 12
8. Title area (sqft): is greater than 7000 AND less than 30000
9. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed building]
```

**Rationale:**
Focuses on high-footfall QSR/retail sites with leases expiring before 2027, enabling surrender/regear and reposition to mixed-use/resi. Sub-12m height and sizable plots support upward/airspace development; unbroken freeholds avoid headlease friction.

**Strengths:**
- Imminent lease expiry creates motivated landlords/tenants
- Footfall validates future commercial at ground floor
- Under-height stock ripe for airspace intensification
- Single freehold simplifies redevelopment timing
- Low planning history indicates untouched uplift

**Limitations:**
- Lease events may already be in negotiation
- Some brands hold renewal rights; surrender costs possible
- High-footfall sites can command strong residual values
- Constraint exclusions may miss edge-case heritage wins
- Footfall data needs on-the-ground validation

**Implementation Strategy:**
Rank by lease end proximity and footfall. Engage landlord and tenant for tri-party: offer surrender plus profit-share on new scheme. Run feasibility on 4-8 resi units above retained/reshaped ground floor. Structure via option/AGM with overage; secure pre-app early to evidence planning support.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/premium to control site: £70k  
- Planning/design/transport/noise studies: £50k  
- Legal + lease surrender negotiation: £35k  
- Contingency (early surveys/rights of light): £35k  
- **Total:** £190k (≤£200k)

## Approach A: Precedent-Driven Intensification (Option Agreement)

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + High Accessibility) and Pattern 4B (Low Capital Entry - Option Agreement)
**Capital Required:** £65,000 (Option & Planning Fees)
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 1.5
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
6. Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
8. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets properties that mirror the fundamental characteristics of the Slough precedent: a mixed-use development in a high-density, transport-oriented location. By filtering for low-rise buildings (`<12m`) near train stations (`<500m`), we identify under-developed sites with strong policy support for intensification (Pattern 3A). The plot size is sufficient for a significant 8-storey scheme.

Crucially, this strategy is adapted for the £200k capital constraint. By targeting off-market properties held for over 10 years (Pattern 4B), we identify owners who may be receptive to an option agreement, eliminating the need for a high upfront acquisition cost. The capital is deployed for securing the site and achieving planning permission, creating value through planning uplift.

**Strengths:**
- Directly emulates the successful planning precedent.
- Targets locations with strong policy support for height and density.
- Capital-efficient strategy, using an option agreement to control a high-value asset with low upfront cost.
- Off-market approach avoids competitive bidding.
- Identifies "tired" owners who may be more flexible on terms.

**Limitations:**
- Success is heavily dependent on negotiating an option agreement.
- Planning risk remains; approval is not guaranteed.
- Requires a longer timeline to realize profit (18-36 months).
- Identifying the correct owner and making contact can be time-consuming.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Execute the search to generate a list of target properties.
2.  **Qualify:** Triage the top 20 results, cross-referencing local plans for specific height policies or site allocations.
3.  **Approach:** Contact the property owners with a well-researched proposal for an option agreement, highlighting the potential value uplift from a new planning consent.
4.  **Secure:** Negotiate and sign an option agreement for a 24-month period, contingent on achieving planning.
5.  **Plan:** Appoint architects and planning consultants to design an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.
6.  **Exit:** Once planning is granted, sell the site with the benefit of the new consent to a major housebuilder or development fund for a significant profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee (2-5% of estimated land value): £40,000
- Planning Application & Consultant Fees: £25,000
- **Total:** £65,000

## Approach B: Airspace Development Over Commercial Hubs

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace Development - Flat Roof + Height Headroom)
**Capital Required:** £170,000 (Airspace Purchase & Design Fees)
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink]
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 750
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15
```

**Rationale:**
This is a sophisticated, capital-efficient strategy to replicate the precedent's density and mixed-use nature by building vertically on top of existing commercial properties. It leverages Pattern 6A by identifying low-rise, flat-roofed commercial buildings in transport-accessible areas. Building residential units above an existing commercial parade naturally creates the mixed-use (Class E/C3) environment of the precedent.

This approach is highly feasible within the £200k capital limit because we are not acquiring the entire property, but only the "airspace" rights to develop above the existing roof. Targeting freehold titles with no leaseholders simplifies the legal process immensely, as consent is only required from one party (the freeholder). The capital is used to purchase the rights and fund the design/planning phase.

**Strengths:**
- Extremely capital-efficient way to achieve high density.
- Bypasses land acquisition costs, which are often the largest expense.
- Creates the target mixed-use outcome organically.
- Locations near train stations are ideal for car-free residential development, strengthening the planning case.
- Faster construction potential as foundations and ground-floor structure are already in place.

**Limitations:**
- Requires specialist legal and structural engineering expertise.
- The existing building's foundation must be able to support additional floors, requiring intrusive surveys.
- Negotiation with the freeholder can be complex.
- Right of light issues for neighbouring properties can be a constraint.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the search to find suitable flat-roofed commercial properties.
2.  **Diligence:** Conduct initial desktop structural analysis and a site visit to assess feasibility.
3.  **Approach:** Contact the freeholder with a proposal to purchase the airspace rights for a residential development.
4.  **Secure:** Negotiate the purchase of the airspace, potentially offering the freeholder a share of the profit or a fixed sum.
5.  **Design & Plan:** Appoint a structural engineer and architect to design the vertical extension and submit a planning application.
6.  **Exit/Build:** Either sell the scheme with planning permission to a developer or secure development finance to build and sell the individual residential units.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Airspace Rights Acquisition Fee: £120,000
- Structural/Architectural/Planning Fees: £50,000
- **Total:** £170,000

## Approach C: EPC Arbitrage (Regulation-Driven)

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Pressure) and Pattern 2A (Motivated Seller)
**Capital Required:** £165,000 (Acquisition & Refurbishment)
**Expected Results:** 50-200 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. EPC rating: is one of [F, G]
2. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
4. Latest sold date: is before 2004-01-01
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
6. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
7. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach is completely different from the precedent and focuses on a high-volume, regulation-driven strategy. It exploits the 2020 Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards (MEES) which make it illegal to rent out properties with an EPC rating of F or G. This regulation creates a highly motivated seller pool.

We target private owners (`Private owner`) who have held the property for over 20 years (`Latest sold date: is before 2004-01-01`), as they are the classic "tired landlord" demographic least likely to have the capital or inclination to perform the required upgrades (Pattern 8C & 2A). By setting a price cap of £150,000, we can acquire the property directly within our £200,000 capital outlay, use the remainder for a basic refurbishment to improve the EPC rating, and then sell the now-compliant property on the open market for a profit.

**Strengths:**
- Exploits a hard, non-negotiable regulatory deadline, creating strong seller motivation.
- Targets a specific, well-understood "tired landlord" demographic.
- Capital-feasible for direct acquisition and refurbishment within the £200k budget.
- Faster turnaround time (6-9 months) compared to development projects.
- Lower risk profile than development; the asset is a standard residential house.

**Limitations:**
- Profit per unit is much lower than a development project.
- Requires a higher volume of deals to reach the £2M target profit.
- Competition from other small-scale investors and builders.
- Refurbishment costs can sometimes exceed budget if unforeseen issues arise.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the search to generate a list of on-market, non-compliant properties.
2.  **Analyze:** Quickly assess the top 10-15 listings, reviewing the EPC report to understand the required upgrades (e.g., insulation, new boiler, windows).
3.  **Offer:** Make offers on multiple properties, factoring in a £15k-£20k budget for refurbishment. The negotiation position is strong due to the property's illegal rental status.
4.  **Acquire:** Purchase the property using the available capital.
5.  **Refurbish:** Immediately undertake the necessary works to improve the EPC rating to at least a 'D' or 'C'.
6.  **Exit:** Relist the compliant property on the market for a quick sale to first-time buyers or other buy-to-let investors.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition Price: £145,000
- Refurbishment Costs (to improve EPC): £15,000
- Stamp Duty/Legal Fees: £5,000
- **Total:** £165,000

### Grok_Approaches

### Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone (FILTER_PATTERNS.md - High-Density/Intensification Strategies)

**Capital Required:** £150,000-£180,000 (within £200k limit)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (narrow focus on Slough and nearby areas with similar development potential)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
2. Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
10. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets properties similar to the approved Slough 8-storey mixed-use development by focusing on sites with existing mixed-use (E and C3) potential, low-rise buildings in high-accessibility areas (PTAL 4+ or near train stations), and minimal planning constraints. The precedent shows successful approval for tall mixed-use in Slough, so we replicate by finding comparable sites with stalled or no recent planning activity, allowing us to apply for similar schemes. Capital is kept low by targeting smaller plots (0.5-2 acres) suitable for phased development, aiming for £2M profit through planning uplift and resale.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching to the Slough approval, increasing planning success likelihood
- High-density potential in transport-accessible areas, aligning with local policy support
- Narrow geographic focus reduces competition and improves result quality
- Combines multiple signals (use class, height, accessibility) for precise targeting

**Limitations:**
- PTAL limited to London/TfL areas; may need to substitute with train station proximity for non-London
- Requires local planning expertise to adapt the Slough precedent
- Smaller plot sizes may limit scale compared to the 8-storey target
- Dependent on market demand for mixed-use in similar locations

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run the filter to identify 10-30 sites in Slough and nearby (e.g., within 5-10 miles).
2. Manually review planning history for each site to confirm no recent tall building applications.
3. Approach owners with the Slough precedent as proof of viability, offering option agreements (£10k-£20k) to secure sites.
4. Engage a planning consultant to prepare applications mirroring the approved scheme.
5. Phase development: Secure planning first, then sell to housebuilder or developer for profit realization.
6. Monitor for fresh planning approvals in the area to refine targeting.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option agreements and legal fees: £20,000
- Planning application and consultant fees: £50,000
- Site surveys and due diligence: £10,000
- Marketing and negotiation costs: £10,000
- Contingency buffer: £10,000
- **Total:** £100,000 (well within £200k, allowing for phased capital deployment)

### Approach B: Low-Capital Derelict Turnaround

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4C: Derelict Asset Turnaround (FILTER_PATTERNS.md - Low Capital Entry Strategies)

**Capital Required:** £120,000-£160,000 (within £200k limit)

**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (broader search for distressed assets across UK)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
7. Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
8. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
9. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
10. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
```

**Rationale:**
This non-precedent-based approach exploits motivated sellers with derelict properties in transport-accessible areas, focusing on low-capital acquisitions under £150k. Unlike the Slough precedent, it targets distressed assets for quick turnaround (demolish/rebuild) rather than planning-intensive schemes, aiming for £2M profit through multiple smaller deals (e.g., buy £100k, rebuild £100k, sell £300k each). It uses regulation-driven motivation (derelict status often tied to compliance issues) and time arbitrage (long-hold owners), with no reliance on specific planning precedents.

**Strengths:**
- Low entry capital allows multiple acquisitions within £200k budget
- Derelict status creates strong seller motivation (asset write-down, compliance pressure)
- Transport proximity ensures exit viability for residential redevelopment
- Broad UK scope increases opportunity pool compared to geographic-specific precedents

**Limitations:**
- Derelict properties may have hidden structural issues requiring additional costs
- Planning for rebuild may face local opposition despite unconstrained sites
- Smaller plot sizes limit profit per deal, requiring volume strategy
- Competition from other distressed asset buyers in accessible areas

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run the filter to identify 20-50 derelict sites across the UK, prioritizing those near train stations.
2. Conduct quick site visits to assess rebuild potential and hidden costs.
3. Negotiate direct purchases or options (£5k-£10k) with motivated owners, emphasizing quick cash offers.
4. Secure planning for residential rebuild (often straightforward on unconstrained sites).
5. Execute demolish/rebuild in phases, selling completed units for profit.
6. Scale by repeating the process across multiple sites for cumulative £2M target.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition costs (multiple sites at £50k-£100k each): £100,000
- Demolition and initial rebuild setup: £30,000
- Planning and legal fees: £15,000
- Due diligence and surveys: £10,000
- Contingency for repairs: £5,000
- **Total:** £160,000 (within £200k, scalable across deals)

# Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

Based on the disagreement analysis, I'm revising several of my positions with evidence-based reasoning:

---

## APPROACHES I'M CHANGING MY ASSESSMENT ON

### 1. **Codex Approach A - Property Type "Mixed Use" Value**
- **Was:** Did not flag "Mixed Use" as invalid in Property type filter
- **Now:** **INVALID** - Filter value error
- **Evidence:** Reference material (AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, line 91-105) explicitly lists only 5 Property type values: Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial. "Mixed Use" is NOT included.
- **Correction:** Should use `Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]` (verified to exist, line 417) OR remove Property type filter entirely and rely on Use class E/C3 combination.

**Validation Gap Acknowledged:** I missed this critical filter value error. All other LLMs caught it correctly.

---

### 2. **Codex Approach B - Article 4 Direction Filter Existence**
- **Was:** "Minor issue - verify exact value"
- **Now:** **MAINTAINING CAUTIOUS POSITION** - Filter likely exists but value format unverified
- **Evidence:** 
  - Gemini claims filter doesn't exist (Disagreement #6)
  - LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md does NOT list "Article 4 Direction" in any section
  - AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md lists "Article 4" (line 286) and "Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions" (line 307) but NOT "Article 4 Direction: does not contain [value]" syntax
  - **Critical finding:** Line 286 shows "Article 4" exists but no operator/value examples provided
- **Conclusion:** Filter name may be just "Article 4" (not "Article 4 Direction"), and value format unclear. Needs verification in SearchLand UI.

**My Position:** I'm upgrading this from "minor" to **"moderate issue - verify filter name AND value format"** but NOT declaring it non-existent like Gemini. Evidence suggests SOME Article 4 filter exists; exact syntax unclear.

---

### 3. **Codex Approach C - Footfall Filter Name**
- **Was:** "Unverified - may be different name"
- **Now:** **CONFIRMED INCORRECT** - Wrong filter name
- **Evidence:** Gemini provided correct name (Disagreement #8): "Average footfall count passing title daily" (verified in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, line 325)
- **Correction:** Change `Average daily footfall:` to `Average footfall count passing title daily:`

**Validation Gap Acknowledged:** I should have cross-referenced the exact filter name in the reference material. Gemini was correct.

---

### 4. **Codex Approach C - Title Area Unit Error**
- **Was:** Not flagged in my original critique
- **Now:** **CRITICAL ERROR** - Unit mismatch (sqft vs acres)
- **Evidence:** 
  - My own reference check (line 1078 of my critique): "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.16 AND less than 0.69"
  - AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, line 32: "**Title area (acres)** ⚠️ NOT sqmt - must convert"
  - All LLMs agree (unanimous, Disagreement #1)
- **Self-Correction:** I DID catch this in my critique (line 1078) but should have flagged it more prominently as CRITICAL rather than just correcting it.

**Acknowledged:** I caught the error but didn't emphasize severity sufficiently. This is a critical filter failure (will return wrong results).

---

## APPROACHES I'M MAINTAINING MY ASSESSMENT ON

### 5. **Claude Approach D - Budget Feasibility (Over-Budget = INVALID)**
- **Still:** **CONDITIONAL** (budget violation makes it questionable)
- **My Position:** Exceeding budget (£225k required vs £200k available) should disqualify OR require explicit co-investor strategy upfront
- **Counter-Position:** Codex/Gemini say JV restructuring makes it "conditional"
- **Evidence Supporting My Position:**
  - User requirement: "£200k capital budget" (hard constraint)
  - No indication user has co-investor lined up
  - Approach D presents £225k as primary strategy, JV as afterthought
  - **Principle:** If budget is stated constraint, exceeding it = invalid unless co-investment is PRIMARY strategy (not fallback)
- **Why I'm Right:** 
  - Codex/Gemini are being generous by calling it "conditional"
  - Realistic assessment: User with £200k ready capital ≠ user who can easily find 50% equity partner
  - Co-investment requires: Legal agreements, aligned incentives, exit coordination (complexity cost)
  - Better approach: Design for £200k upfront, not £225k with "maybe find partner" caveat

**Maintaining CONDITIONAL** but could argue for INVALID. This is judgment call on how strictly to interpret budget constraints.

---

### 6. **Codex Approach B (HMO) & Gemini Approach C (EPC) - Strategic Misalignment**
- **Still:** **INVALID for stated objective** (yield/volume ≠ capital gain)
- **My Position:** These are RENTAL YIELD and VOLUME TRADING strategies, NOT development profit strategies
- **Counter-Position:** Codex/Gemini/Grok say "conditional" with volume scaling
- **Evidence Supporting My Position:**
  - **User objective:** "£2M profit" from "mixed-use development" (capital gain focus, not rental income)
  - **HMO approach:** Increases rental yield (5-8% vs 3-4%) but capital gain minimal (£40k-£90k per property × 20-50 properties = 3-5 year volume strategy)
  - **EPC approach:** £20k-£50k profit per property × 40-100 properties = high-volume trading (not development)
  - **Timeline issue:** Both require 3-5 years with capital recycling (user likely wants 12-24 months)
  - **Strategic mismatch:** User asked for "8-storey mixed-use" precedents, not "buy-refurb-sell flips"

**Why I'm Right:**
- There's a difference between:
  - **Development profit:** Planning gain, intensification, change of use (capital gain from regulatory arbitrage)
  - **Trading profit:** Buy low, add value through refurb, sell (volume strategy)
- User context (Slough 8-storey precedent) clearly indicates DEVELOPMENT focus, not trading
- Codex/Gemini are technically correct (volume CAN reach £2M) but strategically wrong (not what user wants)

**Maintaining INVALID for stated objective.** These are excellent strategies for DIFFERENT objectives (rental yield, volume trading) but wrong for this user's development profit goal.

---

### 7. **OR Operator Syntax - All Approaches**
- **Still:** **INVALID** (unanimous agreement, Disagreement #3)
- **Evidence:** 
  - LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md, line 24-61: "You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line"
  - AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, line 8-45: Explicit examples of invalid syntax
  - All 4 LLMs agree this is wrong
- **Examples of errors found:**
  - Claude A, Filter 2 (self-flagged correctly)
  - Multiple approaches had similar issues

**Unanimous consensus = I was correct.** No change needed.

---

### 8. **"Mixed Use" in Property Type vs Building Use Group**
- **Still:** Property type does NOT have "Mixed Use" value
- **Evidence:**
  - Property type values (line 91-105): Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial (only 5)
  - Building use group values (line 417): Explicitly includes "Mixed Use"
  - **Correct usage:** `Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]`

**I was correct** (caught this in Grok A critique but missed it in Codex A - validation gap acknowledged above).

---

## CLARIFICATIONS

### 9. **"Built Up Areas" - POSITIVE Constraint, Not Blocker**
- **Clarification Needed:** Several LLMs may misunderstand this
- **Evidence:** AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, line 216-264
  - "Built up areas" listed under Planning constraints
  - Line 258: "**Strategic Insight:** 'Built up areas' = urban context (GOOD), NOT a development blocker"
  - Line 290: "Percentage of title in adopted settlement" (related positive indicator)
- **Correct Usage:**
  ```
  Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas, Housing Zones]  // SEEK these
  Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3]  // AVOID these
  ```

**This is a common confusion point** - "constraint" in the filter name doesn't mean "bad." Built up areas = development-friendly urban context.

---

### 10. **PTAL Geographic Limitation**
- **Clarification:** PTAL is LONDON-ONLY (unanimous agreement)
- **Evidence:** 
  - AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, line 207: "**Note:** Higher PTAL values indicate better public transport accessibility. London-specific metric."
  - LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md, line 520-527: "PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area"
- **Grok A Error:** Used PTAL for Slough search (will return 0 results)
- **Correct Alternative:** `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800`

**I was correct** in flagging this as critical error in Grok A.

---

## TECHNICAL PRECISION NOTES

### Filter Syntax Patterns (Reaffirmed)

**List-Based Filters (Use class, Property type, etc.):**
```
✅ CORRECT: Use class: contains any [E, C3]
✅ CORRECT: Property type: contains any [Commercial, Flat]
❌ WRONG: Use class: contains 'E' OR 'C3'
❌ WRONG: Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
```

**Boolean Filters:**
```
✅ CORRECT: Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
✅ CORRECT: Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
❌ WRONG: Building on title is derelict: Yes
❌ WRONG: Sales listing currently on the market: is one of [Yes]
```

**Numeric Ranges:**
```
✅ CORRECT: Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
✅ CORRECT: Max building height (m): is less than 12
❌ WRONG: Title area (sqft): [filter doesn't exist in sqft]
```

## SUMMARY OF POSITION CHANGES

| Issue | Original | Revised | Reason |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| Codex A - "Mixed Use" in Property type | Not flagged | **INVALID** | Validation gap - missed error others caught |
| Codex B - Article 4 filter | Minor issue | **Moderate issue** | Filter name likely wrong ("Article 4" not "Article 4 Direction") |
| Codex C - Footfall filter name | Unverified | **CONFIRMED WRONG** | Gemini provided correct name with evidence |
| Codex C - Title area units | Caught but understated | **CRITICAL ERROR** | Should have emphasized severity more |

| Issue | Position | Counter-Arguments | My Evidence |
|-------|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Claude D - Over-budget | **CONDITIONAL/INVALID** | Codex/Gemini: JV makes it conditional | Budget is hard constraint; JV is complex fallback not viable primary strategy |
| Codex B & Gemini C - Strategy alignment | **INVALID for objective** | Others: Conditional with volume | User wants development profit (capital gain), not yield/trading strategies |

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS (Updated)

### Confirmed Valid (No Changes):
1. ✅ **Gemini A** - Precedent intensification (technically flawless)
2. ✅ **Gemini B** - Airspace development (technically flawless)  
3. ✅ **Grok B** - Derelict turnaround (technically flawless, volume strategy noted)

### Now Upgraded to Invalid (After Review):
- ❌ **Codex A** - Added "Mixed Use" property type error to existing 4 syntax errors → Too many issues, **downgrade to INVALID** (was CONDITIONAL)

### Maintaining Invalid for Strategic Misalignment:
- ❌ **Codex B** (HMO) - YIELD strategy, not capital gain
- ❌ **Gemini C** (EPC) - VOLUME trading, not development  
- ❌ **Claude D** - Exceeds budget (£225k vs £200k)

### Still Conditional (Need Fixes):
- **Claude A** - Fix 2 syntax errors (viable after fixes)
- **Claude B** - Fix 1 syntax error + verify Liquidation value (excellent strategy after fixes)
- **Claude C** - Fix 2 syntax errors + reduce over-constraint (viable after fixes)
- **Codex C** - Fix units + verify filter names (viable after fixes)
- **Grok A** - Fix PTAL error + property type (viable after fixes)

---

**Evidence-Based Conclusion:** I'm maintaining my core technical positions (syntax errors, strategic alignment) while acknowledging 4 validation gaps where I missed or understated errors that other LLMs correctly identified. The disagreements on budget/JV and yield/volume strategies reflect different interpretations of user requirements rather than factual errors - I'm maintaining my stricter interpretation based on stated objectives.

---

### Iteration_Codex (Round 1)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Codex Approach B (HMO, Article 4): Was “needs filter verification,” now “filter exists but rename” because SearchLand’s reference list includes `Article 4` and `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions` (see constraint list ~lines 580–600). Use `Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4]` or the percentage metric instead of “Article 4 Direction: …”. Business case remains conditional on throughput/leverage.
- Claude Approach D (High-PTAL London): Was “conditional if JV,” now “fails stated £200k equity cap unless JV explicitly allowed.” The equity need was £225k+, so it breaches the budget; only becomes conditional if the user pre-approves JV/co-invest to bridge the gap.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Codex Approach A: Still INVALID on filters because `Property type` cannot include “Mixed Use” (allowed values are Detached/Semi-Detached/Terraced/Flat/Commercial) and `Use class: contains all [E, C3]` is overly strict for single-class titles.
- Codex Approach C: Still INVALID due to `Title area (sqft)` (units must be acres), invalid property type value, and unverified footfall/lease-end filter names; prompt is not executable as written.
- Codex Approach B (HMO strategy fit): Still CONDITIONAL for business case—yield/room-by-room plays can reach £2M only via multiple conversions with financing cycles. Not rejecting it outright; it just requires volume beyond single-asset capital.
- Gemini Approach C (EPC arbitrage): Still CONDITIONAL—small per-asset gains demand high volume; feasible with leverage/rapid recycling, but not a single-deal £2M win.

**Clarifications:**
- Article 4 filter existence: It is available in SearchLand under constraints (`Article 4`; `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions`). Gemini’s “non-existent” call is incorrect; the issue is naming the filter correctly.
- Budget rule: I’m treating the £200k equity cap as hard unless the user authorizes JV/partner funding; otherwise any plan requiring >£200k equity is invalid on capital fit.

### Iteration_Gemini (Round 1)

Loaded cached credentials.
Based on the disagreement analysis, I have reconsidered my original assessments. My updated positions are grounded in the provided reference materials and a stricter interpretation of technical and business case viability.

### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**

*   **Codex Approach B (HMO Conversion):** Was **INVALID** (for multiple technical reasons), now my reasoning is corrected.
    *   **Reasoning for Change:** My original critique incorrectly stated that the `Article 4 Direction:` filter was non-existent. This was a factual error. The `SearchLand Available Filters.md` reference confirms an `Article 4` filter does exist. My assessment was flawed.
    *   **Revised Assessment:** The approach remains **INVALID**, but for different reasons. The prompt still contains multiple critical errors: an invalid value for `Property type` (`Residential`), incorrect operator for `Tenure`, and an invalid date format. Furthermore, regarding the business case, I now concur with Claude's assessment: an HMO rental-yield strategy is a fundamental strategic misalignment for a £2M capital gain objective derived from a £200k seed, as it would require an unrealistic scale of operations and leverage.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**

*   **Gemini Approach C (EPC Arbitrage):** Still **VALID**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The disagreement here is philosophical. My position remains that a high-volume, "trading" strategy is a legitimate business model to achieve a capital gain target. While Claude correctly identifies it as a different *type* of strategy from large-scale development, it is not inherently misaligned with the financial goal of realizing £2M in profit. The prompt is technically flawless and the business model is sound.

*   **Claude Approach D (High-PTAL London):** Still **CONDITIONAL**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The disagreement is on interpreting budget constraints. I maintain that identifying a capital need (£225k) slightly above the stated budget (£200k) and explicitly proposing a joint venture (JV) to bridge the gap is a sign of a mature, realistic business case, not a fatal flaw. The approach is rightly conditional on securing that partner. Rejecting it outright would be to ignore standard real estate financing structures.

*   **Codex Approach A & C:** Both still **INVALID**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The consensus is clear and my original assessment holds. Approach A uses an invalid `Property type` value ('Mixed Use'). Approach C uses the wrong units for `Title area` ('sqft' instead of 'acres'). Both are critical, unrecoverable technical errors.

**Clarifications:**

1.  **On Business Case: Volume/Yield vs. Large-Scale Development:** My assessments treat any strategy that feasibly generates the target capital gain as valid, whether through a single large project or high-volume trading (e.g., EPC arbitrage). I acknowledge these are different business models with different risk and operational profiles. My `VALID` rating confirms the model's soundness, not necessarily its suitability for a user who may implicitly prefer a single, large development project.

2.  **On Factual Correctness (Article 4 Filter):** I retract my previous assertion that the `Article 4` filter does not exist. It was a factual error based on incomplete knowledge, which I have now corrected by reviewing the provided documentation. My process has been updated to more rigorously verify filter existence against the `SearchLand Available Filters.md` document before declaring a filter non-existent.

---

### Iteration_Grok (Round 1)

### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Claude Approach D: Was INVALID, now CONDITIONAL because JV/co-investment restructuring makes the approach feasible within the £200k equity constraint, as evidenced by Codex and Gemini assessments that treat it as conditional rather than disqualified; budget violation alone does not make it invalid when partnership options exist.
- Codex Approach B: Was CONDITIONAL, now VALID because the business case alignment with yield/volume strategies is auto-valid for precedent-based approaches per user request, and the technical issue (Property type filter) is the only remaining concern but does not invalidate the overall approach.
- Gemini Approach C: Was VALID, now CONDITIONAL because while technically sound, the business case requires volume scaling for £2M target (per Codex/Grok), making it conditional on execution at scale rather than guaranteed.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Claude Approach A: Still CONDITIONAL because the OR syntax error in Filter 2 ("Proposal: contains 'retail' OR 'commercial' OR 'Class E'") violates SearchLand's filter parser limitations (no OR operators in single filters), as confirmed by unanimous consensus in disagreements #1-3; "Class E" is also invalid (should be "E - Commercial Business and Service").
- Claude Approach B: Still VALID because all filters are correct per reference materials, and the liquidation motivation signal is strong (LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md confirms "Company status: Liquidation" as forced sale indicator).
- Claude Approach C: Still CONDITIONAL because Filter 9 ("Built up areas") uses incomplete syntax; correct form is "Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]" per reference materials.
- Codex Approach A: Still CONDITIONAL because Filter 3 ("Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]") uses invalid value; "Mixed Use" does not exist in Property type (only Detached/Semi-Detached/Terraced/Flat/Commercial), per reference and disagreement #2 consensus.
- Codex Approach C: Still INVALID because Filter 1 ("Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]") and Filter 8 ("Title area (sqft)") use invalid values/units; SearchLand supports only acres for title area, not sqft (reference: "Title area (acres)").
- Gemini Approach A: Still VALID because all filters exist with correct syntax per reference materials.
- Gemini Approach B: Still VALID because all filters exist with correct syntax per reference materials.
- Grok Approach A: Still CONDITIONAL because Filter 2 ("Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]") uses invalid value; "Mixed Use" does not exist in Property type.
- Grok Approach B: Still VALID because all filters exist with correct syntax per reference materials.

**Clarifications:**
- Business case is auto-valid for precedent-based approaches per user request, so yield/volume strategies (e.g., HMO conversion, EPC arbitrage) are acceptable for £2M capital gain objectives despite strategic misalignment concerns; focus remains on filter accuracy.
- "Article 4 Direction" filter exists as "Article 4" in planning constraints (reference: "Planning constraints" list includes "Article 4"); Gemini's claim of non-existence is incorrect, but exact value format ("C4/HMO") may need verification as Claude noted.

##  Filter Operators for List-Based Filters

**Many SearchLand filters use predefined value lists (not free text).** These filters have specific operators:

### Available Operators for List-Based Filters:

| Operator | Logic | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **contains any** | OR (implicit) - matches if ANY selected value is present | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| **contains all** | AND (implicit) - matches only if ALL selected values present | `Use class: contains all [E, C3]` |
| **does not contain** | Exclusion - excludes if value is present | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| **is equal to** | Exact match - only this specific value | `Use class: is equal to [E]` |

### ❌ INVALID Syntax (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Use class: E AND C3
```

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ✅ CORRECT Syntax:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]
✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** (predefined planning classes)
- **Property type** (Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.)
- **Property classification** (separate taxonomy from Use class)
- **Tenure** (Freehold, Leasehold, etc.)
- **Ownership type** (Corporate, Individual, etc.)
- Any filter showing checkbox options in the UI

### Text/Numeric Filters (Use comparison operators):
- **Title address:** `contains`, `does not contain` (free text)
- **Proposal:** `contains` (free text keyword search)
- **Title area (acres):** `is greater than`, `is less than`, `is equal to` (numeric)
- **Price:** `is greater than`, `is less than` (numeric)

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors. If the filter value is not document you can make some assumption about it's expected behaviour and create a filter based on that. We will test your assumption and document any discrepancies here. 

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: List-Based Filter Operators (MOST COMMON ERROR)

**ISSUE:** LLMs frequently write invalid syntax for filters with predefined value lists (Use class, Property type, etc.)

### The Problem

SearchLand filters with **predefined value lists** (shown as checkboxes in UI) use specific operators:
- `contains any` (OR logic - matches if ANY value is present)
- `contains all` (AND logic - requires ALL values)
- `does not contain` (exclusion)
- `is equal to` (exact match)

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ❌ INVALID Examples (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
   // SearchLand does not support OR operators within a filter line

❌ Use class: contains 'E' AND Use class: contains 'C3'
   // SearchLand does not support AND operators within a filter line

❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
   // Wrong syntax - no OR operators

❌ Use class: E AND C3
   // Wrong syntax - no AND operators
```

**Why This Fails:**
- SearchLand's AI prompt parser does not recognize `OR`/`AND`/`NOT` as operators
- It treats the entire string as a literal search term
- The filter will return zero results or unexpected matches

### ✅ CORRECT Examples:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Multiple values in single filter with "contains any" operator
   // This matches properties with EITHER E OR C3 (implicit OR)

✅ Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Requires BOTH E AND C3 to be present (implicit AND)

✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
   // Correct: Excludes properties with B2 use class

✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use, Residential]
   // Correct: Matches any of these property types

✅ Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
   // Correct: Exact match for single value
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** - Planning use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Property type** - Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.
- **Property classification** - Separate taxonomy from Use class
- **Tenure** - Freehold, Leasehold, etc.
- **Ownership type** - Corporate, Individual, etc.
- **Any filter showing checkbox options in UI**

### Syntax Pattern:

```
[Filter name]: [operator] [comma-separated list of values in square brackets]
```

**Examples:**
```
Use class: contains any [E, C3, C4]
Property type: does not contain [Agricultural]
Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
```

### Common Corrections:

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |
|-------------|-----------|
| `Use class: contains 'E' OR 'C3'` | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| `Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Mixed'` | `Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]` |
| `Use class: NOT 'B2'` | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| `Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'` | `Tenure: contains any [Freehold, Leasehold]` |

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**Boolean Operators in List-Based Filters:**
```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'C3'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
```
- List-based filters do NOT support `OR`, `AND`, `NOT` operators within a single filter line
- **Correct:** `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]`
- Use `contains any` for OR logic, `contains all` for AND logic

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

**Building Height - Auto-Conversion Behavior ⚠️**
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
SearchLand AI may auto-convert between height metrics:
- "Max building height on title (m): is less than 12" 
  → May create "Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4"
- Conversion assumes ~3m per floor
- Both filters exist separately in SearchLand

Available Height Filters:
✅ Max building height on title (m) - absolute height in metres
✅ Max number of building floors on title - storey count
✅ Number of building floors in title - actual floor count

RECOMMENDATION:
- If you want floors, specify floors (more reliable parsing)
- If you want metres, specify metres (but verify which filter was created)
- Always check SearchLand UI to confirm which filter was applied

Example:
# If you want 3-4 storey buildings:
✅ Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4  (explicit, reliable)
⚠️ Max building height on title (m): is less than 12  (may auto-convert to floors)

Conversion Reference:
12m ≈ 3-4 floors
15m ≈ 4-5 floors  
18m ≈ 5-6 floors
25m ≈ 7-9 floors
(Assumes 3-4m per storey)
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Sui Generis" Use Class - Display Name Clarification
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
When you filter for "Sui Generis" use class, SearchLand displays it as:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

CLARIFICATION:
- "Outside of the defined classes" = Sui Generis
- Sui Generis = Uses that don't fit into standard use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- Examples: Car showrooms, petrol stations, nightclubs, launderettes, taxi businesses, 
  scrap yards, casinos, theatres, amusement arcades, hostels, motor vehicle repair

Filter correctly parses when you use:
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]

Display in SearchLand UI:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

Note: This is just a display difference - the filter works correctly.
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Complex Multi-Line Prompts May Be Partially Ignored ⚠️ CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

ISSUE:
- When providing 8+ filter lines in a single prompt, SearchLand AI may only parse 2-3 filters
- More complex the prompt structure, higher the failure rate
- No clear pattern for which filters get dropped
- Can result in massively inflated result counts (e.g., 25,910 instead of 10-50)

Example Failure:
Prompt with 8 filters → Only 2 created (Max floors, Tenure auto-added)
Missing: Distance to station, title area, use class, sold date, applications, on market

SOLUTION:
1. **Simplify prompt structure:**
   - Separate compound AND conditions into individual lines
   - Avoid mixing multiple filter types in rapid sequence
   
2. **Break into smaller chunks:**
   - Start with 4-5 filters, verify they parse
   - Add remaining filters manually in UI if needed
   
3. **Always verify before clicking Search:**
   - Count filters created vs filters requested
   - Check filter names match what you asked for
   - Add missing filters manually using "Add Filter" button

Success Pattern (Iteration 2):
- Split "is greater than X AND less than Y" into two separate lines
- Used simpler filter names (e.g., "floors" instead of "height in metres")
- Result: 8/8 filters successfully parsed

Related: See "Multiple AND Conditions" section below
```

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably

RELIABILITY TIP (Discovered 2025-11-24):
While AND works in simple prompts, complex prompts (6+ filters) benefit from splitting:

❌ Less Reliable (in complex prompts):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5

✅ More Reliable (always parses):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25
Title area (acres): is less than 1.5

WHEN TO SPLIT:
- Complex prompts (6+ filters total)
- When other filters are failing to parse
- When you need guaranteed reliability

WHEN SINGLE LINE IS OK:
- Simple prompts (3-5 filters)
- When used alone or with minimal other filters
- Numeric ranges are the primary search criteria
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

Example:
1. [Exact filter usage]

Performance/Notes:
- [Any observations]
```
Related: [Link to FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable]
```

## Newly Documented Filters (v5.2.3)

### Property Type

**Context:**
- Simple residential/commercial classification (different from "Property classification")
- Only 5 values: Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial
- Used for basic property type filtering

**Operators:** `contains all`, `contains any`, `does not contain`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property type: contains any [Detached, Semi-Detached]
Property type: contains all [Commercial, Flat]  // Mixed-use commercial flats
Property type: does not contain [Terraced]
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property type: Detached AND Semi-Detached
```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Do NOT confuse with "Property classification" (which has 500+ values)

---

### Tenure

**Context:**
- Legal ownership structure
- 5 values: Leasehold, Freehold, Pending first registration, Caution against first registration, Rentcharge
- Critical for acquisition strategy (Freehold = full ownership, Leasehold = time-limited)

**Operator:** `is one of` (implicit OR)

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Leasehold, Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Pending first registration]  // Unregistered land - potential opportunity
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'
❌ Tenure: NOT 'Leasehold'
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Freehold only:** For long-term hold/development (no ground rent complications)
- **Leasehold:** Can indicate motivated sellers (especially short leases <80 years)
- **Pending first registration:** Unregistered land - may have title issues but also opportunities

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Combine with "Lease end date" for leasehold properties to find short leases

---

### Property Classification

**Context:**
- Comprehensive taxonomy with ~500+ values across 24 major categories
- Separate from "Use class" (planning) - this is Ordnance Survey classification
- Hierarchical: Commercial > Hotel/Motel > Youth Hostel (example)
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT mix with "Use class" values

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**Major Categories:**
- Commercial, Education, Hotel/Motel, Industrial, Leisure, Medical, Animal Centre, Office, Broadcasting, Retail, Storage Land, Transport, Utility, Emergency/Rescue, Information, Land, Water, Military, Other, Parent Shell, Residential, Unclassified, Dual Use, Object of Interest

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property classification: contains any [Commercial, Residential]
Property classification: contains all [Development Site, Residential Construction Site]
Property classification: does not contain [Military, Prison]
Property classification: exactly matches [Hotel/Motel]
Property classification: contains any [Vacant / Derelict Land, Development Site]  // Opportunity sites
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property classification: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property classification: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]  // WRONG - that's Use class, not classification
❌ Property classification: Development Site AND Residential  // Use 'contains all' instead
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Development Site:** Active construction - may indicate market activity
- **Vacant / Derelict Land:** Potential redevelopment opportunities
- **Care / Nursing Home:** For care home conversion strategies
- **Hotel/Motel:** For hotel-to-residential conversions
- **Warehouse / Store / Storage Depot:** For industrial-to-residential conversions

**Performance/Notes:**
- Slower filter due to large value set - use strategically
- More granular than "Property type" but less planning-specific than "Use class"
- Can combine with "Use class" for precision (e.g., Classification: Hotel + Use class: C3 for converted hotels)

### PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level)

**Context:**
- London-specific metric (Transport for London)
- 9 values: 0 (Worst), 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)
- Higher = better public transport access = higher land values + planning support for density
- **CRITICAL:** Only available in London - will return zero results elsewhere

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
PTAL: contains any [6a, 6b (Best)]  // Excellent transport - supports tall buildings
PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]  // Good to excellent
PTAL: does not contain [0 (Worst), 1a, 1b]  // Exclude poor transport areas
PTAL: exactly matches [6b (Best)]  // Only the very best
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ PTAL: '6a' OR '6b'
❌ PTAL: is greater than 4  // Not a numeric filter - use 'contains any' with list
❌ PTAL: High  // Must use exact values (0, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b)
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **High-density development:** PTAL 4+ supports planning for tall buildings
- **Residential demand:** PTAL 5+ = premium pricing for car-free living
- **Planning policy:** Many London boroughs require PTAL 3+ for car-free developments
- **Opportunity:** PTAL 2-3 areas with planned transport improvements (check TfL plans)

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- **London only** - always combine with London geography filters
- Use with "Distance to nearest Train Station" for non-London areas
- PTAL ratings can change - check TfL website for planned improvements

**Related Filters:**
- Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - for non-London areas
- Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m)
- Distance to nearest Rapid Transit Stop/Station (m)

### Planning Constraints

**Context:**
- 34 constraint types covering environmental, heritage, policy, and flood risk
- Critical for assessing development viability
- Some are absolute blockers (Green Belt, SSSI), others provide policy support (Housing Zones)
- **IMPORTANT:** "Built up areas" is POSITIVE (urban context), not a constraint to avoid

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (34 constraints)
- **Absolute Blockers:** Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, World heritage sites, Scheduled Monuments, National Parks, National Landscapes (AONB)
- **Flood Risk:** Flood Zone 2 (negotiable), Flood Zone 3 (major blocker)
- **Policy Support (SEEK):** Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas, Areas Of Intensification, Site Allocations, Built up areas
- **Heritage:** Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer (less restrictive), Parks and Gardens, Battlefields
- **Environmental:** SAC, SPA, RAMSAR, National Nature Reserves, Local Nature Reserves, Country Parks, CROW
- **Urban Planning:** Central Activities Zone (London), SIL, LSIS, Town Center Boundaries, Designated Open Space
- **Other:** Tree Preservation Order (TPO), Nutrient Neutrality

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]  // Avoid major blockers
Planning constraints: contains any [Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas]  // Seek policy support
Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Exclude protected sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Housing Zones, Built up areas]  // Urban housing policy areas
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]  // Exclude Green Belt only
Planning constraints: contains any [Site Allocations]  // Sites allocated for development in local plan
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Planning constraints: NOT 'Green Belt'
❌ Planning constraints: 'Green Belt' OR 'Conservation Area'
❌ Planning constraints: does not contain [Built up areas]  // WRONG - Built up areas is GOOD!
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Urban Brownfield Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
   ```

2. **High-Density Development (London):**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [Central Activities Zone, Opportunity Areas]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
   ```

3. **Avoid All Major Blockers:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   ```

4. **Industrial Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [SIL, LSIS]  // Strategic/Locally Significant Industrial - may be released
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
   ```

5. **Flood Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3]  // Exclude high risk
   Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 2]  // Accept Zone 2 (mitigation possible)
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Use "Percentage of plot un-constrained" to find sites with minimal coverage (e.g., >80%)
- **Critical distinction:** "Built up areas" = urban context (GOOD), NOT a development blocker
- Green Belt = ~13% of England - major constraint but some brownfield exceptions exist
- Conservation Areas = ~2% of England - design restrictions, not necessarily a blocker
- Flood Zone 3 = high risk - insurance issues, planning refusal likely
- Flood Zone 2 = medium risk - mitigation measures required but achievable

**Related Filters:**
- Percentage of plot un-constrained (%) - Find sites with <20% constraint coverage
- Area of plot un-constrained (acres) - Absolute unconstrained area
- Percentage of title covered by Green Belt - Partial coverage may be workable
- Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2/3 - Assess flood risk extent

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Clean sites for quick planning
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80

# Policy-supported urban sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]

# Heritage-adjacent (not on-site)
Planning constraints: contains any [Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Near but not on
```

### Building Use Group

**Context:**
- High-level functional classification - 17 categories
- Less granular than "Use class" (planning), more functional than "Property type"
- Good for broad filtering before applying detailed "Use class" filters
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly listed as a category (unlike in Property type)

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (17 categories)
- **Commercial:** Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing, Commercial Activity: Other
- **Residential:** Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation
- **Public Services:** Education, Government Services, Medical or Emergency Services
- **Infrastructure:** Transport, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Construction
- **Other:** Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Attraction Sports or Activity, Religious Worship and Funeral Services, Mixed Use, Unknown

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other]
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection]
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // All residential types
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail]  // Retail focus
Building use group: does not contain [Unknown]  // Exclude unclear properties
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Building use group: 'Mixed Use' OR 'Commercial'
❌ Building use group: NOT 'Agriculture'
❌ Building use group: contains any [C3, E]  // WRONG - those are Use class values, not Building use group
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Broad Commercial Search:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]
   ```

2. **Exclude Non-Development Sites:**
   ```
   Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
   ```

3. **Mixed-Use Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
   // Then refine with specific Use class filters
   ```

4. **Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // Hotels to residential
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]  // Industrial to residential
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Good for initial broad filtering, then refine with "Use class"
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly tagged - useful for precedent-based searches
- "Unknown" category exists - may want to exclude or investigate separately
- More intuitive than "Use class" codes but less planning-specific

**Relationship to Other Filters:**
- **Broader than:** Use class (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Narrower than:** Property type (Detached, Commercial, etc.)
- **Different from:** Property classification (OS taxonomy)

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Broad commercial search, then refine
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other]
Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]

# Residential focus with mixed-use
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Mixed Use]
Property type: contains any [Flat, Commercial]

# Exclude unsuitable for development
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
```
