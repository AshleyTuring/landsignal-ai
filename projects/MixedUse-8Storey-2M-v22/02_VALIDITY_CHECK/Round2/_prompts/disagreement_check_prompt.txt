# Disagreement Detection Task

Analyze the 4 critique files and identify TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS CASE DISAGREEMENTS.

## What Counts as Disagreement
- LLM A says filter exists, LLM B says it doesn't (factual dispute)
- LLM A says "acres", LLM B says "sqft" for same filter (unit dispute)
- LLM A says VALID syntax, LLM B says INVALID syntax (technical dispute)
- LLM A says £n is sufficient, LLM B says it's not (capital feasibility dispute)
- LLM A says ROI achievable, LLM B says unrealistic (business case dispute)
- LLM A says deal structure works, LLM B says legally/financially flawed (implementation dispute)

## What Does NOT Count
- Priority rankings (A ranks #1, B ranks #3 - both valid)
- Strategic preferences (speed vs certainty - philosophical)
- Implementation styles (different but both correct)

## Special Note on Precedent-Based Approaches
For approaches replicating user-provided planning applications:
- Business case is AUTO-VALID (user requested it)
- Focus validation on: Do filters actually replicate the precedent correctly?
- Multiple valid filter implementations are expected and acceptable

## Output Format
If disagreements exist:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** [Filter existence | Units | Syntax | Capital feasibility | ROI | Deal structure]
**Approaches:** [Which approaches affected]
**Positions:**
- LLM A: [Position]
- LLM B: [Position]
- LLM C: [Position]
- LLM D: [Position]

**Impact:** [Critical | Minor]
**Requires iteration:** [YES | NO]

---

If no disagreements:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: NO

All LLMs agree on technical and business case facts. Strategic differences are preserved.


## CRITIQUES TO ANALYZE

### Critique_Claude

I'll provide the comprehensive validation report directly:

# Comprehensive Technical & Business Case Validation Report

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a thorough validation of all 12 approaches across 4 LLMs, checking filter existence, syntax correctness, unit accuracy, capital feasibility, ROI calculations, and implementation viability.

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All 10 filters correct (no errors)
- ✅ Capital: £160k (within budget)
- ⚠️ ROI: £80k-£120k per property (requires 16-20 properties for £2M)
- ⚠️ Strategic alignment: Volume trading strategy, not single development

**No technical changes needed**, but note this is a volume strategy (3-5 years, multiple properties).

---

### ⚠️ CONDITIONAL APPROACHES (Fixable Errors)

#### 4. **Claude Approach A: Slough Precedent Replication**
**Status:** **CONDITIONAL** ⚠️

**Technical Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL - Filter 2: Invalid OR syntax**
   ```
   ❌ Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial" OR "Class E"
   ```
   **Fix:**
   ```
   ✅ Proposal: contains "retail" AND "mixed"
   ✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   ```

2. **CRITICAL - Filter 2: Invalid "Class E" format**
   - SearchLand requires full format: "E - Commercial Business and Service"

**After fixes:** Excellent strategy, £53k-£168k capital, £2M-£3.5M ROI achievable.

---

#### 5. **Claude Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage**
**Status:** **CONDITIONAL** ⚠️

**Technical Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL - Filter 2: Verify "Liquidation" value**
   ```
   ⚠️ Company status: is one of [Liquidation]
   ```
   - Need to check SearchLand UI dropdown for exact value
   - Possible values: "Liquidation", "In Liquidation", "In Administration"

**Business Case Issue:**
- ⚠️ Volume strategy required (3-5 sites) to hit £2M
- Single site profit: £220k-£570k (below target)

**After verification + volume acceptance:** Strong forced-sale strategy, £110k-£176k capital.

---

#### 6. **Claude Approach C: Legacy Holdings Conversion**
**Status:** **CONDITIONAL** ⚠️

**Technical Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL - Filter 1: Unclear syntax**
   ```
   ❌ No latest sold date
   ```
   **Fix:**
   ```
   ✅ Latest sold date: is before 1990-01-01
   ```

2. **CRITICAL - Filter 9: Incomplete syntax**
   ```
   ❌ Built up areas
   ```
   **Fix:**
   ```
   ✅ Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]
   ```

3. **MINOR - Filter 3: Restrictive**
   ```
   Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
   ```
   Consider: `is less than 2` (less restrictive)

**After fixes:** Excellent off-market strategy, £64k-£194k capital, £690k-£1.9M per site ROI.

---

#### 7. **Gemini Approach C: EPC Arbitrage**
**Status:** **CONDITIONAL** ⚠️

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ NO technical errors (filters perfect)
- ✅ Capital: £165k (within budget)
- ❌ ROI: £15k-£35k per property (requires 60-80 properties for £2M)
- ❌ Strategic alignment: Volume trading (5-10 years), not development

**Issue:** Technically flawless but wrong strategy type for user objective (trading vs development).

---

#### 8. **Grok Approach A: Slough Mid-Rise Intensification**
**Status:** **CONDITIONAL** ⚠️

**Technical Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL - Filter 2: Invalid Property type value**
   ```
   ❌ Property type: contains any [Mixed Use]
   ```
   **Fix:**
   ```
   ✅ Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
   OR remove filter entirely
   ```

2. **CRITICAL - Filter 5: PTAL is London-only**
   ```
   ❌ PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
   ```
   **Fix:** Remove (already has distance to station filter)

**After fixes:** Good precedent strategy, £100k capital (leaves £100k buffer).

---

### ❌ INVALID APPROACHES (Critical Errors)

#### 9. **Claude Approach D: High-PTAL London**
**Status:** **INVALID** ❌

**Issues:**
- ❌ NO technical errors (filters perfect)
- ❌ Budget violation: Requires £225k vs £200k available
- ❌ Requires JV partner (not in user requirements)
- ❌ ROI: Conservative scenario = LOSS; optimistic = £500k (below £2M)
- ❌ London S106/CIL too high (35-50% affordable housing)

**Conclusion:** Technically correct but financially unviable for £200k solo capital strategy.

---

#### 10. **Codex Approach A: Slough Mid-Rise Intensification**
**Status:** **INVALID** ❌

**Technical Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL - Filter 2: "contains all" too restrictive**
   ```
   ❌ Use class: contains all [E, C3]
   ```
   - Requires BOTH E AND C3 on single title (rare)
   - **Fix:** `contains any` (EITHER E OR C3)

2. **CRITICAL - Filter 3: Invalid Property type value**
   ```
   ❌ Property type: is one of [Mixed Use, Commercial]
   ```
   - "Mixed Use" does NOT exist in Property type
   - **Fix:** `Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]`

**Conclusion:** Multiple critical filter errors make approach non-viable without major rework.

---

#### 11. **Codex Approach B: HMO Conversion**
**Status:** **INVALID** ❌

**Technical Issues:**
- Minor date format issue (fixable)
- Article 4 filter name needs verification

**Critical Issue:**
- ❌ **Strategic misalignment:** This is a RENTAL YIELD strategy, not development
- ❌ ROI: £30k-£90k per property (need 25-30 properties for £2M)
- ❌ Timeline: 3-5 years with capital recycling
- ❌ User wants: Development profit (planning uplift), not rental yield

**Conclusion:** Wrong strategy type for user objective (yield vs capital gain).

---

#### 12. **Codex Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry**
**Status:** **INVALID** ❌

**Technical Issues:**
1. **CRITICAL - Filter 8: Wrong units**
   ```
   ❌ Title area (sqft): is greater than 7000 AND less than 30000
   ```
   - SearchLand ONLY has `Title area (acres)`
   - **Fix:** Convert to acres (0.16 - 0.69 acres)

2. **MINOR - Filter 2: Value format**
   - Use class values need exact format

3. **MINOR - Filter 6: Filter name**
   - Should be "Average footfall count passing title daily"

**Conclusion:** Critical units error (filter doesn't exist) makes approach non-executable.

---

## MOST COMMON ERRORS (Cross-LLM Patterns)

### 1. **Property Type "Mixed Use" ❌**
**Frequency:** 3 times (Codex A, Codex C implied, Grok A)
**Error:** "Mixed Use" is NOT a valid Property type value
**Correct values:** Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial (only 5)
**Fix:** Use `Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]`

### 2. **Title Area Units (sqft vs acres) ❌**
**Frequency:** 1 time (Codex C)
**Error:** `Title area (sqft)` doesn't exist - ONLY `Title area (acres)`
**Fix:** Convert sqft to acres (divide by 43,560)

### 3. **OR Operator Syntax ❌**
**Frequency:** 1 time (Claude A)
**Error:** SearchLand does NOT support OR within single filter line
**Fix:** Use `contains any [value1, value2]` for implicit OR logic

### 4. **Strategic Misalignment (Trading vs Development) ⚠️**
**Frequency:** 3 times (Codex B HMO, Gemini C EPC, Grok B Derelict)
**Issue:** Volume trading strategies (15-80 properties) for development objective (single large project)

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Immediate Use (No Changes):**
1. ✅ **Gemini A** - Precedent-driven intensification (£65k, £2M-£3.5M ROI)
2. ✅ **Gemini B** - Airspace development (£170k, portfolio approach)

### **Quick Fixes (< 5 minutes):**
1. ⚠️ **Claude A** - Remove OR operators, fix "Class E"
2. ⚠️ **Grok A** - Remove PTAL, fix Property type

### **Moderate Fixes (Need verification):**
1. ⚠️ **Claude B** - Verify "Liquidation" value in SearchLand UI
2. ⚠️ **Claude C** - Fix 3 syntax issues (date, "Built up areas")

### **Reject (Not Viable):**
1. ❌ **Claude D** - Exceeds budget, requires JV
2. ❌ **Codex A** - Multiple critical filter errors
3. ❌ **Codex B** - Wrong strategy (yield not development)
4. ❌ **Codex C** - Critical units error

### **Conditional (Strategic Decision Needed):**
1. ⚠️ **Gemini C** - Perfect technically, but is volume trading acceptable? (60-80 properties, 5-10 years)
2. ⚠️ **Grok B** - Perfect technically, but is volume distressed trading acceptable? (16-20 properties, 3-5 years)

### Critique_Codex

Claude - Approach A: CONDITIONAL  
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters mostly exist but Filter 2 uses unsupported inline OR syntax and Filter 7 is best split into two lines for reliability; business case fits £200k and ROI is plausible if planning succeeds.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- Filter 2 should be `Proposal: contains any [retail, commercial, E - Commercial Business and Service]` (no OR).  
- Filter 7 range should be split into two filters for parsing reliability.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Replace Filter 2 with `contains any` list.  
- Split the acreage band into two filters.

Claude - Approach B: CONDITIONAL  
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist/syntax OK; capital is within £200k, but ROI to £2M depends on closing 3–5 sites, not a single deal.  
**Technical Issues:** None material.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Explicitly plan for portfolio volume (3–5 sites) and recycling capital.

Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL  
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Business case fits budget, but prompt has missing/invalid filters.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- “No latest sold date” needs a real filter (e.g., `Latest sold date: is blank` if supported) or replace with `Latest sold date: is before 19xx-01-01`.  
- Filter 3 should be `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`.  
- Filter 9 must be `Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]`.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Use supported latest-sold syntax; correct Filters 3 and 9.

Claude - Approach D: CONDITIONAL  
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters are valid, but base case breaches £200k equity and the pro forma shows tight/negative margin unless JV/co-invest or cheaper site is found.  
**Technical Issues:** None.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Lock JV/partner equity or target sub-£1.5M assets; rework finance so total equity ≤£200k and revisit cost/affordable assumptions.

Codex - Approach A: INVALID  
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Prompt is not executable as written.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- `Property type: Mixed Use` is not a valid value (allowed: Detached/Semi-Detached/Terraced/Flat/Commercial).  
- `Use class: contains all [E, C3]` is over-restrictive for single-class titles; use `contains any` or separate filters.  

Codex - Approach B: INVALID  
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Multiple filter/name/unit errors; business case also needs volume.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- `Property type: Residential` not valid.  
- Article 4 should be via `Planning constraints`/percentage, not `Article 4 Direction`.  
- Property floor area unit/filter (`sqft`) not confirmed in Available Filters.

Codex - Approach C: INVALID  
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Key filters don’t exist/are in wrong units.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- `Property type: Mixed Use` invalid.  
- `Title area (sqft)` should be `Title area (acres)`.  
- `Average daily footfall` filter not in the documented filter list.  

Gemini - Approach A: VALID  
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist with correct syntax; capital plan (£65k) is within budget and planning-uplift route is viable, though success depends on planning.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Consider splitting the acreage band into two filters for parser reliability.  

Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL  
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Strategy feasible within £200k, but one filter is unverified and ROI to £2M needs volume or bigger schemes.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- Confirm `A building in the title has flat roof` exists; if not, swap to `Roof type: Flat` or manual verification.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Verify/replace flat-roof filter; model deal count/exit needed for £2M target.

Gemini - Approach C: CONDITIONAL  
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters valid; capital fits. Profit per unit is low—£2M requires high deal volume/recycling.  
**Technical Issues:** None.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Set volume target (e.g., 10–15 deals) and secure refurbishment funding lines.

Grok - Approach A: INVALID  
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Prompt uses an invalid property type and mixes PTAL (London-only) with a Slough focus.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- `Property type: Mixed Use` not allowed.  
- PTAL returns nothing outside London; combine with train-distance instead if non-London.  

Grok - Approach B: CONDITIONAL  
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist and capital fits; hitting £2M depends on executing multiple small derelict turnarounds.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- Ensure `Use class: does not contain [B2]` is supported; if not, invert with `Use class: contains any [...]` for allowed classes.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Plan portfolio throughput (e.g., 5–8 projects) and validate use-class exclusion syntax.

### Critique_Gemini

Loaded cached credentials.
Here is the technical and business case validation for each approach, based on the provided reference materials.

### Claude - Approach A: Slough Precedent Replication - Stalled Mixed-Use with Height Approval
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is coherent and capital-efficient. However, the SearchLand prompt contains three technical syntax errors that would prevent it from running correctly.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 2 (Proposal):** Uses `OR` operators within a single filter line, which is invalid syntax. It should use separate filter groups or rely on the `Use class` filter.
- **Filter 8 (Inactive):** Uses `Yes` for a boolean filter. The correct syntax is `is equal to Yes`.
- **Filter 9 (On Market):** Uses `Yes` for a boolean filter. The correct syntax is `is equal to Yes`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **Filter 2:** Rephrase using the `Use class` filter, such as `Use class: contains any [E(a), E(b), ...]` for more precise targeting than a proposal text search.
- **Filter 8:** Change to `Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes`.
- **Filter 9:** Change to `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes`.

### Claude - Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales with Development Potential
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** An excellent strategy targeting highly motivated sellers with strong, valid filters. The business case is realistic, noting the need for a volume approach. The prompt has minor, correctable syntax errors.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 1 (Ownership type):** Uses `is equal to Company`. The correct syntax is `is one of [Company]`.
- **Filter 6 (Derelict):** Uses `Yes` for a boolean filter. The correct syntax is `is equal to Yes`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **Filter 1:** Change to `Ownership type: is one of [Company]`.
- **Filter 6:** Change to `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes`.

### Claude - Approach C: Legacy Holdings Conversion - Off-Market Mixed-Use Opportunities
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** A strong, off-market strategy leveraging information asymmetry. The business case is sound. The prompt, however, has several invalid or incomplete filter syntaxes.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 1 (Sold Date):** `No latest sold date` is a concept, not a valid filter syntax. A workaround, like setting `Latest sold date: is before [very old date]`, is required.
- **Filter 3 (Applications):** `Less than 1 application in last 5 years` is incomplete. Correct syntax is `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`.
- **Filter 9 (Built up areas):** This is an incomplete filter. Correct syntax is `Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **Filter 1:** Change to `Latest sold date: is before 1995-01-01` (to capture pre-digital records).
- **Filter 3:** Correct to `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`.
- **Filter 9:** Correct to `Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]`.

### Claude - Approach D: High-PTAL Low-Rise Intensification - London Tall Building Zones
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The business case is fundamentally flawed as it fails the primary capital constraint. The approach's own analysis shows a required equity of £225k, exceeding the user's £200k budget. While a JV is suggested as a fallback, a valid approach must be feasible with the stated constraints.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 8 (On Market):** Uses `Yes` for a boolean filter. The correct syntax is `is equal to Yes`.

**Strategic Notes:**
- The ROI calculations show this is a high-risk strategy with tight margins, even if the capital issue were resolved.

---
### Codex - Approach A: Slough Mid-Rise Intensification (Precedent Match)
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The prompt contains multiple critical and non-functional technical errors related to filter values and operators, making it unusable.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 3 (Property type):** Uses `Mixed Use`, which is not a valid value for the `Property type` filter.
- **Filter 4 (Tenure):** Uses the operator `is equal to` and omits brackets. Correct syntax is `is one of [Freehold]`.
- **Filter 9 (Inactive):** Uses `Yes` for a boolean filter. Correct syntax is `is equal to Yes`.

### Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (High Yield, Low Capital)
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The prompt is technically riddled with errors (invalid values, operators, and date formats). Furthermore, the strategy (HMO/rental yield) is fundamentally misaligned with the user's stated goal of achieving a £2M profit from a large-scale development project.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 1 (Property type):** `Residential` is not a valid value.
- **Filter 3 (Tenure):** Incorrect operator and missing brackets.
- **Filter 7 (Ownership type):** Incorrect operator and missing brackets.
- **Filter 8 (Sold date):** Invalid date format. Must be `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Filter 10 (Article 4):** Incorrect filter name (`Article 4 Direction`). The correct filter is `Article 4` within `Planning constraints`.

**Strategic Notes:**
- This is a rental yield and volume trading strategy, not a development capital gain strategy. It does not align with the precedent-based objective.

### Codex - Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry Reposition (QSR/Retail to Mixed Use)
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The prompt is technically unusable due to multiple critical errors, including a fatal unit mismatch (`sqft` for `Title area`) and several invalid filter names and values.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 1 (Property type):** Uses `Mixed Use`, an invalid value.
- **Filter 3 (Tenure):** Incorrect operator and missing brackets.
- **Filter 5 (Lease end date):** Invalid date format.
- **Filter 6 (Footfall):** `Average daily footfall` is the wrong filter name. Correct is `Average footfall count passing title daily`.
- **Filter 8 (Title area):** **CRITICAL ERROR.** Uses `sqft` where the filter only accepts `acres`.
- **Filter 10 (Constraints):** `Listed building` is an incomplete value.

---
### Gemini - Approach A: Precedent-Driven Intensification (Option Agreement)
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is technically flawless, with all filters using correct syntax and values. The business case is sound, capital-efficient, and directly aligned with the user's objective of replicating the precedent using an option-based strategy.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Gemini - Approach B: Airspace Development Over Commercial Hubs
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** An excellent and creative strategy that is both capital-efficient and strategically sound. The prompt has one minor, easily correctable syntax error.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 1 (Flat roof):** Uses `Yes` for a boolean filter. The correct syntax is `is equal to Yes`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **Filter 1:** Change to `A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes`.

### Gemini - Approach C: EPC Arbitrage (Regulation-Driven)
**Status:** VALID (Technically) / CONDITIONAL (Strategically)
**Reasoning:** The prompt is technically flawless. The business model is sound and viable within the capital constraints. However, it represents a strategic pivot from a single large-scale development to a high-volume trading strategy. While it can achieve the profit target, it is not aligned with the nature of the user's precedent-based request.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

**Strategic Notes:**
- This is a "flipper" or volume trading strategy, which has a different risk, operational, and time-scale profile than the core development objective. Its validity depends on whether the user is open to alternative business models to reach the financial goal.

---
### Grok - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The prompt contains two critical technical errors that would cause it to fail to produce relevant results. Using the London-specific PTAL filter for a search in Slough is a fatal logical flaw.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Filter 2 (Property type):** Uses `Mixed Use`, which is not a valid value for the `Property type` filter. `Building use group` should be used instead.
- **Filter 5 (PTAL):** **CRITICAL ERROR.** PTAL is a London-only filter and cannot be used for a search in Slough. This filter will cause the search to return zero results.

### Grok - Approach B: Low-Capital Derelict Turnaround
**Status:** VALID (Technically) / CONDITIONAL (Strategically)
**Reasoning:** The prompt is technically flawless. The business strategy is a viable volume-based approach to reach the profit target. As with Gemini's Approach C, this is a different business model (volume trading) than the user's primary objective (large-scale development).

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

**Strategic Notes:**
- This approach is valid but requires executing multiple smaller deals to reach the target, which is a different operational model than the single-project precedent.

### Claude - Approach A: Slough Precedent Replication - Stalled Mixed-Use with Height Approval
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Technically sound overall with proven precedent logic and capital/ROI within bounds, but has syntax errors that would prevent proper execution. Strategic diversity preserved as precedent-based stalled planning approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 2 uses unsupported OR syntax ("OR") in a single filter line, which SearchLand AI cannot parse
- Filters 8-9 use incorrect boolean syntax ("Yes" instead of "is equal to Yes")

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change Filter 2 to: `Proposal: contains any ["retail", "commercial", "Class E"]` (but note "Class E" should be "E - Commercial Business and Service")
- Change Filters 8-9 to: `Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes` and `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes`

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Strong for replicating specific local precedents; complements off-market approaches

### Claude - Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales with Development Potential
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Excellent motivation signal from liquidation status with viable capital/ROI, but boolean syntax error prevents execution. Preserves strategic diversity as distressed asset approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 6 uses incorrect boolean syntax ("Yes" instead of "is equal to Yes")

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change Filter 6 to: `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes`

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Unique forced-sale motivation; pairs well with precedent approaches for volume

### Claude - Approach C: Legacy Holdings Conversion - Off-Market Mixed-Use Opportunities
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Strong off-market strategy with low capital and good ROI potential, but critical filter errors would return zero results. Maintains strategic diversity as relationship-based legacy holdings approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 1 ("No latest sold date") is non-existent; no such filter in SearchLand
- Filter 9 ("Built up areas") uses incorrect syntax; should be part of Planning constraints filter

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace Filter 1 with: `Latest sold date: is before 1980-01-01` (proxy for never sold)
- Change Filter 9 to: `Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]`

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Excellent for patient capital; fills gap between quick flips and long-term development

### Claude - Approach D: High-PTAL Low-Rise Intensification - London Tall Building Zones
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Capital exceeds £200k budget (£225k+ required), making it financially infeasible despite technically sound filters and good ROI potential. Violates hard budget constraint.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 8 uses incorrect boolean syntax ("Yes" instead of "is equal to Yes")

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A (capital violation makes it invalid)

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Strong London-focused policy approach; could be adapted with JV partner to meet budget

### Codex - Approach A: Slough Mid-Rise Intensification (Precedent Match)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Solid precedent focus with capital/ROI within bounds, but filter value and syntax errors would cause failures. Preserves strategic diversity as geographic precedent replication.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 3 uses invalid Property type value ("Mixed Use" not available; only Detached/Semi-Detached/Terraced/Flat/Commercial)
- Filter 9 uses incorrect boolean syntax ("Yes" instead of "is equal to Yes")

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change Filter 3 to: `Property type: contains any [Commercial]` (or remove if using Use class)
- Change Filter 9 to: `Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes`

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Geographic focus provides planning de-risking; similar to Claude A

### Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (High Yield, Low Capital)
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Strategic misalignment (yield-focused HMO strategy vs. capital gain development objective) combined with multiple filter errors. Does not meet stated goal of £2M profit from mixed-use development.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 1 uses invalid Property type value ("Residential" not available)
- Filter 8 uses invalid date format ("is less than 2004" instead of "is before 2004-01-01")
- Filter 10 uses incorrect filter name ("Article 4 Direction" instead of "Article 4" or "Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions")

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A (strategic misalignment)

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Valid for rental yield strategies but wrong for this development objective

### Codex - Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry Reposition (QSR/Retail to Mixed Use)
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Multiple critical filter errors (units, names, values) would prevent execution, plus strategic misalignment with yield focus. Capital/ROI potentially viable but filters non-functional.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 1 uses invalid Property type value ("Mixed Use" not available)
- Filter 5 uses invalid date format ("Lease end date (year): is less than 2027" instead of proper date filter)
- Filter 6 uses incorrect filter name ("Average daily footfall" instead of "Average footfall count passing title daily")
- Filter 8 uses wrong units ("Title area (sqft)" instead of acres)

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A (too many critical errors)

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Interesting lease expiry motivation but filters need complete rewrite

### Gemini - Approach A: Precedent-Driven Intensification (Option Agreement)
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters correct with proper syntax, capital within budget, ROI achievable. Excellent strategic diversity as low-capital option-based precedent approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Strong patient capital model; complements aggressive approaches

### Gemini - Approach B: Airspace Development Over Commercial Hubs
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Innovative airspace strategy with viable capital/ROI, but boolean syntax error prevents execution. Preserves strategic diversity as vertical intensification approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 1 uses incorrect boolean syntax ("Yes" instead of "is equal to Yes")

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change Filter 1 to: `A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes`

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Unique airspace angle; fills technical diversity gap

### Gemini - Approach C: EPC Arbitrage (Regulation-Driven)
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Strategic misalignment (trading/refurb strategy vs. development profit) despite technically sound filters and capital fit. Does not deliver mixed-use development outcomes.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A (strategic misalignment)

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Valid for volume trading but not development objective

### Grok - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Good precedent logic with capital/ROI within bounds, but filter value error and PTAL geographic limitation would reduce results. Maintains strategic diversity as precedent-focused approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 2 uses invalid Property type value ("Mixed Use" not available)
- PTAL filter only works in London (approach appears UK-wide)

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change Filter 2 to: `Property type: contains any [Commercial]` or remove
- For non-London: Replace PTAL with `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Similar to Claude A but broader geographic scope

### Grok - Approach B: Low-Capital Derelict Turnaround
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Strong distressed asset strategy with capital/ROI fit, but date format error prevents execution. Preserves strategic diversity as quick-turnaround approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 8 uses invalid date format ("is before 2010" instead of "is before 2010-01-01")

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change Filter 8 to: `Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01`

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Good for volume strategy; pairs with liquidation approaches
