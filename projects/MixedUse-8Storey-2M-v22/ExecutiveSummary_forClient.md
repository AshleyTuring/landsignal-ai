## Strategy 1: Mixed-Use Development Opportunities ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**Status:** ✅ 100% Viable Rate  
**Properties Found:** 24  
**Sample Tested:** 6 properties  
**Capital Required:** £50,000-£300,000 per deal

### Rationale

Target small-scale mixed-use properties (commercial ground floor + residential above) with significant airspace development potential. These properties are:
- Low-rise (1-2 storeys) with potential for 3-5 storey intensification
- Small scale (0.04-0.3 acres) = manageable capital requirements
- Clean ownership (freehold or minimal leaseholds)
- Well-located near transport
- Free from major planning constraints

### Strengths

- ✅ **Proven success rate:** 100% viable in 6-property sample
- ✅ **Airspace upside:** All properties <8m height with 3-5 storey potential
- ✅ **Clean ownership:** Freehold or <3 leaseholds (simpler negotiations)
- ✅ **Transport accessible:** Supports higher density planning policy
- ✅ **Manageable scale:** £50k-£300k per property within budget
- ✅ **Planning-friendly:** Urban context, no major constraints

### Limitations

- ⚠️ Recent sales only (excludes long-term holdings)
- ⚠️ May concentrate in specific areas
- ⚠️ Active market = potential competition
- ⚠️ Planning timeline: 12-18 months typical

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Screening & Validation (Weeks 1-4)**
1. Desktop due diligence on all 24 properties
2. Land Registry checks (ownership, leaseholds, charges)
3. Planning portal review (history, constraints)
4. Shortlist 10 properties with 3-5 storey potential

**Phase 2: Owner Engagement (Weeks 5-12)**
1. Approach owners with option proposals
2. 12-24 month option period
3. £10k-£50k option fee (1-5% of estimated value)
4. Negotiate 2-3 option agreements concurrently

**Phase 3: Planning Process (Months 4-18)**
1. Pre-application consultation (£5k-£20k)
2. Architect feasibility studies (£10k-£30k)
3. Planning application (£5k-£15k fees + £20k-£50k consultants)
4. Manage to approval

**Phase 4: Exit (Months 19-24)**
1. Market consented site to developers/housebuilders
2. Assign option or sell freehold (if purchased)
3. Target: £800k-£1.2M with consent vs. £200k-£400k land value

**Profit Model:** £50k option + £50k planning = £100k invested → sell £1M = **£900k profit per deal × 2-3 deals = £1.8M-£2.7M**

### Capital Breakdown (Per Deal)

- Option agreement: £10,000-£50,000
- Legal fees: £3,000-£8,000
- Planning consultant: £20,000-£50,000
- Planning application: £10,000-£30,000
- Surveys/investigations: £5,000-£15,000
- Contingency (10%): £5,000-£15,000
- **Total:** £53,000-£168,000 ✅ Within £200k budget

## Strategy 2: HMO Conversion Opportunities

**Status:** ✅ 67% Viable Rate  
**Properties Found:** 46  
**Sample Tested:** 6 properties  
**Capital Required:** £160,000-£190,000 per deal

### Rationale

Target large single-family homes (>2,000 sqft, 8-12 rooms) with poor energy performance certificates (EPC E-G). Convert to Houses in Multiple Occupation (HMOs) to achieve 2-3× yield uplift.

Key motivation signals:
- Poor EPC = cannot legally rent until improved
- Long-term ownership (10+ years) = tired landlord
- No recent planning activity = passive holding
- Yield arbitrage: 3-bed BTL 3-4% → 6-8 bed HMO 6-9%

### Strengths

- ✅ Clean acquisition (single negotiation, no leaseholders)
- ✅ EPC pressure creates discount motivation
- ✅ Clear HMO scale (>2,000 sqft = 6-8 beds proven)
- ✅ Yield uplift 2-3× on same asset
- ✅ Planning risk lower (C3→C4 often permitted)
- ✅ Market liquidity (sell to investors or families)

### Limitations

- ⚠️ Article 4 restrictions (must check per property)
- ⚠️ EPC F/G may require heavy capex (£30k-£50k)
- ⚠️ Conversion costs £40k-£60k
- ⚠️ License saturation in some areas
- ⚠️ Amenity space standards vary by council

### Implementation Strategy

**Weeks 1-4:** Screen properties, cross-check Article 4 register  
**Weeks 5-8:** Approach owners ("EPC problem, needs £30k, we offer cash")  
**Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate 10-20% discount  
**Months 4-6:** Convert (EPC £20k-£30k, HMO fit-out £20k-£30k)  
**Months 7-8:** HMO license, rent (6-8 beds @ £600/month = £43k-£58k gross)  
**Exit:** Hold for 8% net × 5 years OR flip to investor at £310k (12 months)

**Profit Model:** £160k + £50k conversion = £210k → sell £310k = **£100k profit × 20 deals = £2M**

### Capital Breakdown (Per Deal)

- Acquisition (25% deposit + fees): £80,000
- Conversion works + compliance: £55,000
- Professional fees: £10,000
- Licensing/EPC/contingency: £15,000
- **Total:** £160,000 ✅ Within £200k budget

### Sample Properties Tested

1. **69 Burnham Lane, Slough** [^2]
   - Size: 0.10 acres
   - Ownership: Company, 1 leasehold
   - Unconstrained: 82.87%
   - ⚠️ **Conditional:** Leasehold complication

2. **9 Ledgers Road, Slough** [^2]
   - Size: 0.072 acres
   - Ownership: Company, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 100%
   - ✅ **Viable:** Clean ownership

3. **137 Burnham Lane, Slough** [^2]
   - Size: 0.27 acres
   - Ownership: Private, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 91.36%
   - ✅ **Viable:** Large plot

4. **244 High Street, Slough** [^2]
   - Size: 0.053 acres
   - Ownership: Private, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 100%
   - ✅ **Viable:** High street location

5. **24 Ward Gardens, Slough** [^2]
   - Size: 0.09 acres
   - Ownership: Private, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 20.96%
   - ⚠️ **Conditional:** Low unconstrained %

6. **55 Royston Way, Slough** [^2]
   - Size: 0.13 acres
   - Ownership: Private, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 100%
   - ✅ **Viable:** Clean opportunity

**Result:** 4/6 fully viable + 2 conditional = **67% success rate**

## Strategy 3: Large Plot Development (Run Down Homes)

**Status:** ✅ 50% Viable Rate (But 1 Star Property)  
**Properties Found:** 2  
**Sample Tested:** 2 properties  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£200,000 per deal

### Rationale

Target large detached houses (0.5-1 acre) with very low building coverage (<30% built) and poor EPC ratings. These represent land-rich development opportunities where the existing house can be demolished or retained, and 8-12 new units built.

Key characteristics:
- Large plots (0.5-1 acres = 21,780-43,560 sqft)
- Minimal existing development (6-10% built = 90%+ available land)
- Private ownership (potentially motivated - poor EPC, run down)
- Single dwelling (simple acquisition)

### Strengths

- ✅ Exceptional land value opportunity (93% undeveloped)
- ✅ Private owner motivation (poor EPC, maintenance burden)
- ✅ Simple acquisition (single dwelling, no leaseholds)
- ✅ Large development potential (8-12 units possible)
- ✅ **£500k-£2M+ profit potential per property**

### Limitations

- ⚠️ Very low volume (only 2 properties found)
- ⚠️ Green Belt risk (must verify constraints)
- ⚠️ Planning may face local opposition (density increase)
- ⚠️ Requires full planning permission (12-18 months)
- ⚠️ Higher capital requirement if purchasing outright

### Implementation Strategy

**Months 1-2:** Approach owner with option proposal  
**Months 2-4:** Negotiate option (£10k-£50k, 18-24 months, planning-contingent)  
**Months 4-6:** Architect feasibility (8-12 unit scheme)  
**Months 6-18:** Planning application and approval  
**Exit:** Sell consented site to housebuilder

**Profit Model:** £30k option + £50k planning = £80k → sell £1.5M-£2M = **£1.42M-£1.92M profit**

### Capital Breakdown (Per Deal)

- Option fee: £10,000-£50,000
- Planning consultant: £20,000-£40,000
- Architect/feasibility: £15,000-£30,000
- Planning application: £10,000-£20,000
- Surveys/investigations: £10,000-£20,000
- Legal fees: £5,000-£10,000
- Contingency: £10,000-£30,000
- **Total:** £80,000-£200,000 ✅ Within £200k budget

### Sample Properties Tested

1. **83 Sussex Place, Slough (SL1 1NN)** [^3]
   - Size: 0.50 acres (21,780 sqft)
   - Built: **6.6%** (only 1,448 sqft house)
   - Available land: **20,340 sqft** (93% undeveloped!)
   - Ownership: Private, freehold
   - Unconstrained: 70.59%
   - Planning activity: Minimal (3 applications)
   - ✅✅ **STAR PROPERTY:** Exceptional development potential
   - **Potential:** 8-12 units (2,000-3,000 sqft each)
   - **Profit:** £500k-£2M+

2. **Manor Farm, Common Road, Dorney, Windsor** [^3]
   - Size: 0.84 acres (36,590 sqft)
   - Built: 8.5% (3,101 sqft)
   - Available land: 33,490 sqft
   - Ownership: Private, freehold
   - Unconstrained: **0%** (100% planning constraints)
   - Green Belt: **Strong designation**
   - ❌ **Not Viable:** Undevelopable due to Green Belt

**Result:** 1/2 viable = **50% success rate** (but that 1 property is exceptional)

**Note:** Low volume strategy, but Property 1 alone could deliver £2M profit target.

---

## Strategy 4: Legacy Holdings (Poor EPC Properties)

**Status:** ✅ 67-100% Viable Rate (Depending on Refinement)  
**Properties Found:** 139 (refined) / 462 (base)  
**Sample Tested:** 6 properties  
**Capital Required:** £50,000-£150,000 per deal

### Rationale

Target properties with 20+ year ownership, poor EPC ratings (E-G), and no recent sales. These owners face:
- Regulatory pressure (cannot legally rent with poor EPC)
- Improvement costs (£5k-£50k to upgrade EPC)
- Long-term holding fatigue
- Potential estate planning motivation

This is a **volume play** targeting £50k-£200k profit per property through refurbishment or HMO conversion.

### Strengths

- ✅ High volume (139 properties after refinement)
- ✅ Strong motivation signals (20+ years, poor EPC)
- ✅ Regulatory pressure (forced action)
- ✅ Small capital per deal (allows multiple acquisitions)
- ✅ Multiple exit routes (refurb, HMO, small development)

### Limitations

- ⚠️ Lower profit per deal (£50k-£200k vs. £500k-£2M)
- ⚠️ Requires volume (need 10-20 deals for £2M target)
- ⚠️ Some properties too small (<0.05 acres)
- ⚠️ Leasehold properties mixed in (must filter)
- ⚠️ **Not suitable for £2M profit goal** (better for £50k-£200k profit)

### Implementation Strategy

**Weeks 1-4:** Screen properties, identify best opportunities  
**Weeks 5-12:** Approach owners (focus on EPC problem, offer solution)  
**Months 4-6:** Acquire at discount (10-20% below market)  
**Months 6-9:** Refurbish or convert to HMO  
**Exit:** Sell or hold for yield

**Profit Model:** £80k acquisition + £30k refurb = £110k → sell £180k = **£70k profit × 20-30 deals = £1.4M-£2.1M**

### Sample Properties Tested (Refined Strategy)

1. **1 Tuns Lane, Slough** [^4]
   - Size: 0.15 acres
   - Ownership: Company, freehold, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 100%
   - ✅ **Viable:** Clean opportunity

2. **7 Tuns Lane, Slough** [^4]
   - Size: 0.11 acres
   - Ownership: Company, freehold, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 100%
   - ✅ **Viable:** Good size

3. **68 Whitby Road, Slough** [^4]
   - Size: 0.067 acres
   - Ownership: Company, freehold, 0 leaseholds
   - Unconstrained: 100%
   - ✅ **Viable:** Minimum viable size

**Base Strategy Sample (Before Size Filter):**

4. **48 Queens Court, Slough** [^5]
   - Size: 0.0087 acres (340 sqft)
   - Ownership: Company, **Leasehold**
   - ❌ **Not Viable:** Too small + Leasehold

5. **5 Tuns Lane, Slough** [^5]
   - Size: 0.12 acres
   - Ownership: Company, freehold
   - Unconstrained: 100%
   - ✅ **Viable**

6. **36 St Pauls Avenue, Slough** [^5]
   - Size: 0.049 acres
   - Ownership: Company, freehold
   - Unconstrained: 86.68%
   - ✅ **Viable** (borderline size)

**Result:** 
- Base strategy: 4/6 viable (67%)
- Refined strategy: 3/3 viable (100%)

**Recommendation:** Use refined strategy with size and tenure filters for better hit rate.

## Strategy 5: Airspace Development (Commercial Buildings)

**Status:** ❌ 0% Viable Rate (Needs Refinement)  
**Properties Found:** 68  
**Sample Tested:** 3 properties  
**Capital Required:** £170,000-£195,000 per deal

### Rationale

Target commercial buildings with flat roofs and potential to add residential storeys above. Purchase airspace rights (20-40% of freehold value) rather than full ownership.

### Strengths

- ✅ Lower capital (airspace rights vs. full ownership)
- ✅ Landowner keeps income (easier negotiation)
- ✅ Policy support (housing crisis, urban intensification)
- ✅ Flat roof = lower construction costs

### Limitations

- ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** 30-40% fail structural survey (£10k-£15k sunk cost)
- ⚠️ Properties returned too large (2-11 acres = institutional scale)
- ⚠️ Multiple leaseholds (ownership complexity)
- ⚠️ Requires significant refinement to find suitable properties
- ⚠️ Party wall agreements (2-6 month delays)
- ⚠️ Fire regulations (second staircase £80k-£150k)

### Sample Properties Tested

1. **Fleetwood House, 480 Bath Road, Slough** [^6]
   - Size: **2.98 acres** (institutional scale)
   - Leaseholds: 1
   - Unconstrained: 16.07%
   - ❌ **Not Viable:** Too large, heavily constrained

2. **225 Bath Road, Slough** [^6]
   - Size: **11.67 acres** (massive institutional site)
   - Leaseholds: 7
   - Unconstrained: 94.27%
   - ❌ **Not Viable:** Requires £5M-£20M capital

3. **Acorn House, 20 Wellcroft Road, Slough** [^6]
   - Size: 0.27 acres
   - Leaseholds: 1
   - Unconstrained: 50.91%
   - ⚠️ **Conditional:** Leasehold complication

**Result:** 0/3 viable = **0% success rate**

**Issue:** Strategy needs significant refinement to exclude large institutional properties and focus on 0.1-0.5 acre sites.

**Recommendation:** Revisit after refining property size criteria (0.1-0.5 acres, <1 leasehold).

---

## Strategy 6: Legacy Holdings (HMO Conversion)

**Status:** ❌ 0% Viable Rate (Flawed Strategy)  
**Properties Found:** 4  
**Sample Tested:** 3 properties  

### Rationale

Target single dwellings suitable for HMO conversion in areas without Article 4 restrictions.

### Critical Flaw

**Missing Green Belt exclusion filter** - all properties returned were in Strong Green Belt areas with 0% developable land.

### Sample Properties Tested

1. **1 Little Sutton Lane, Slough** [^7]
   - Size: 0.19 acres
   - Unconstrained: **0%**
   - Green Belt: **Strong**
   - ❌ **Not Viable:** Undevelopable

2. **2oar Little Sutton Lane, Slough** [^7]
   - Size: 0.13 acres
   - Unconstrained: **0%**
   - Green Belt: **Strong**
   - ❌ **Not Viable:** Undevelopable

3. **2 Little Sutton Lane, Slough** [^7]
   - Size: 0.24 acres
   - Unconstrained: **0%**
   - Green Belt: **Strong**
   - ❌ **Not Viable:** Undevelopable

**Result:** 0/3 viable = **0% success rate**

**Recommendation:** Do not pursue this strategy without significant refinement to exclude Green Belt properties.

- ⚠️ Requires 10-20 deals to reach £2M target
- Better suited for volume investors, not £2M profit goal

**Strategy 5: Airspace Commercial**
- ❌ 0% viable rate (needs significant refinement)
- ❌ Properties too large for capital available
- Revisit only after strategy refinement

**Strategy 6: Legacy Holdings (HMO)**
- ❌ 0% viable rate (flawed - Green Belt issue)
- Do not pursue

---

## Conclusion

Our analysis identified **Strategy 1 (Mixed-Use Development Opportunities)** as the clear winner with:
- 100% viable rate in testing
