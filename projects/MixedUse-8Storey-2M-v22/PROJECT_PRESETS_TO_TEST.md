## 🎯 **YES! You're Absolutely Right - There ARE Better Presets!**

Looking at SearchLand's presets for Slough, here are the ones that **better match Approach A's intent:**

---

## 🏆 **BEST MATCH: "Mixed use search"**

```
Preset: Mixed use search
Description: Freehold mixed-use properties with commercial & resi units
Results: 151 sites in Slough LPA
```

**This is EXACTLY what Approach A was trying to achieve!**

### **Why This is Better:**
- ✅ Pre-configured by SearchLand (proven to work)
- ✅ Already filters for freehold
- ✅ Already filters for mixed-use (actual properties, not just planning precedent)
- ✅ 151 results (much larger pool than our 2)
- ✅ Focuses on EXISTING mixed-use, not planning precedent

---

## 🥈 **ALSO RELEVANT: "Mixed use developments"**

```
Preset: Mixed use developments
Description: Sites combining residential and commercial uses
Results: 17 sites in Slough LPA
```

**Smaller, more curated set - might be higher quality.**

## 💡 **The Key Insight You Just Discovered:**

### **Our Approach A Strategy Was BACKWARDS! ❌**

```
What we did:
- Searched for "Proposal contains: mixed-use" (planning precedent)
- Got: Community buildings, shopping centers, properties that MENTIONED mixed-use in planning

What we should have done:
- Use SearchLand's "Mixed use search" preset
- Gets: Actual freehold mixed-use properties currently operating
