## Approach A: Class MA Premium Liquidation


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration forced sale) + Class MA PDR  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£50M  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (Zone 1-2, highly targeted)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)]
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND less than 150000
4. Ownership type: is equal to [Company]
5. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
6. Building on title is derelict: Yes OR Building on title is inactive: Yes
7. NOT Use class: contains [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
8. NOT Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
10. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
```

## **Rationale**
Class MA permitted development route provides 56-day approval vs 8-12 months traditional planning. Liquidation/Administration status creates **forced sale** context (Pattern 2D) - strongest motivation signal with legal obligation to divest. Derelict/inactive filters add secondary motivation (non-performing asset). Size range (10k-150k sqft) targets £10M-£40M Zone 1-2 commercial values. PTAL 4+ ensures premium residential location post-conversion. <800m train station reinforces luxury positioning.

## **Strengths**
- **Maximum seller motivation:** Legal obligation to sell (liquidators/administrators)
- **PDR speed advantage:** 56-day approval vs 8-12 months traditional planning
- **Below-market pricing:** 15-25% discount typical in forced sales
- **Cash buyer advantage:** Liquidators prioritize speed and certainty
- **Premium locations:** PTAL 4+ + train proximity = luxury residential demand

## **Limitations**
- **Very limited pool:** Corporate liquidations rare in Zone 1-2
- **Building condition risk:** Deferred maintenance common in distressed assets
- **Class MA restrictions:** 2-year prior use requirement, size limits (<1,500 sqm)
- **Competition:** Other cash buyers target liquidation sales

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City of London, Camden, K&C (Zone 1 LPAs)
2. **Week 2:** Expand to Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney if <5 results
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize properties with triple motivation (liquidation + derelict + EPC E-G)
4. **Week 4:** Land Registry search for liquidator/administrator contact details
5. **Month 2:** Approach with fast-track acquisition proposal (cash, no financing contingency)
6. **Due diligence:** Building survey (£10k-£30k), Class MA eligibility confirmation, GDV assessment
7. **Timeline:** 30-90 days acquisition, 12-18 months conversion, 24-30 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £8M-£40M (liquidation discount 15-25% below market)
- **Building survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Class MA prior approval:** £5k-£15k
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£200/sqft (luxury spec, 10k-150k sqft = £1.5M-£30M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £1M-£7M
- **Total:** £10M-£50M

## Approach B: Airspace Corporate Long Hold


**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2A (Long corporate hold/tired landlord) + Airspace development  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£30M  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8]
3. NOT Use class: contains [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
4. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 8000 AND less than 100000
6. Max building height on title (m): is less than 18
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 1.5
8. Ownership type: contains any [Corporate, Company]
9. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2010
10. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
11. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
12. NOT Planning constraints: contains any [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

## **Rationale**
Flat roof + low-rise (<18m = 3-6 storeys) creates headroom for 3-5 additional storeys. Corporate ownership + 15+ year hold signals trapped equity/asset rationalization opportunity (Pattern 2A). <3 leaseholds simplifies negotiation. PTAL 4+ provides policy support for intensification (London Plan density guidance). Conservation Area exclusion increases airspace approval probability.

## **Strengths**
- **Lower upfront capital:** Airspace rights purchase cheaper than full freehold acquisition
- **Corporate sellers:** Professional decision-makers, faster negotiation
- **Long hold motivation:** 15+ years = trapped equity creates rationalization pressure
- **Policy support:** PTAL 4+ areas favor intensification (London Plan)
- **Existing infrastructure:** Utilities, access, structural base already present

## **Limitations**
- **Structural survey critical:** £10k-£30k cost, risk of unsuitable load capacity
- **Planning not guaranteed:** Airspace requires approval (not PDR like Class MA)
- **Party wall complexity:** Zone 1-2 dense urban context complicates agreements
- **Freeholder negotiation:** If purchasing airspace rights only, complex deal structuring required

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City, Camden, K&C (Zone 1)
2. **Week 2:** Expand to Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington if <10 results
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize corporate ownership + 15+ year hold + flat roof + <12m height (3-4 storeys = most airspace potential)
4. **Month 2:** Approach freeholders with dual offer: (a) Airspace purchase, or (b) JV structure
5. **Due diligence:** Structural survey (£10k-£30k), rights-to-light analysis, planning feasibility study
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £1M-£5M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Construction:** £250-£350/sqft (3-5 storeys, 10k-40k sqft new = £2.5M-£14M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £400k-£2M
- **Total:** £10M-£30M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Structural survey budget must be clarified upfront (£10k-£30k per property). Recommend allocating £100k-£200k survey budget for screening 10-20 properties before committing to acquisitions.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Add structural survey screening step to workflow
3. Document survey findings in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
4. Update capital breakdown based on actual survey costs

## Approach C: Lease Expiry Premium Office


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8B (Lease expiry/income cliff) + EPC compliance pressure  
**Capital Required:** £20M-£80M  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties (Zone 1-2, premium offices)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Use class: contains any [E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), B2]
2. NOT Use class: contains [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 15000 AND less than 200000
5. Lease end date: is before 31/12/2026
6. Ownership type: contains any [Corporate, Company]
7. EPC rating: contains any [D, E, F, G]
8. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
10. NOT Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
```

## **Rationale**
Lease expiry <2026 creates 6-12 month motivation window (Pattern 8B - income cliff). Corporate ownership = institutional rationalization opportunity. Low EPC (D-G) adds second motivation layer: cannot re-let without £50k-£500k EPC improvement (MEES regulations). 15k-200k sqft targets £15M-£60M Zone 1-2 premium office values. PTAL 4+ + <500m train = luxury residential conversion potential.

## **Strengths**
- **Predictable motivation timeline:** Lease expiry date known (6-12 month window)
- **Double motivation:** Expiring lease + poor EPC (cannot easily re-let)
- **Class MA potential:** Large offices often eligible for PDR conversion
- **Premium locations:** High PTAL, <500m train = luxury residential demand
- **Corporate sellers:** Professional decision-makers, fast transactions

## **Limitations**
- **High capital requirement:** £20M-£80M (top of Landmass budget range)
- **Tenant renewal risk:** Tenant may renew lease (motivation disappears)
- **EPC improvement costs:** £50k-£500k required before conversion
- **Commercial market competition:** Office recovery may attract commercial buyers

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City of London, Camden (Zone 1 premium)
2. **Week 2:** Target lease expiry 6-12 months out (sweet spot for motivation)
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize vacant post-expiry properties (strongest signal: no income, carrying costs £50k-£200k/month)
4. **Month 2:** Approach with value proposition: "Fast completion, avoid void period, capital ready"
5. **Due diligence:** Class MA eligibility check, structural survey, EPC improvement cost estimate, GDV assessment
6. **Negotiation strategy:** Quantify void costs vs immediate sale (£50k-£200k/month saving)
7. **Timeline:** 3-6 months acquisition, 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £15M-£60M (Zone 1-2 office values, 10-20% discount for expiring lease)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (15k-200k sqft = £2.25M-£50M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £2M-£11M
- **Total:** £20M-£80M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Prioritize properties with lease expiry 6-12 months out (add manual date screening)
3. Create landlord approach script emphasizing void cost savings
4. Document void cost benchmarks in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach D: Mixed-Use EPC Intensification


**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8C (EPC compliance pressure) + Airspace + Long hold (Pattern 2A)  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£45M  
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties (Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i)]
3. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000 AND less than 80000
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
7. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
8. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
9. Ownership type: contains any [Company, Private owner]
10. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2015
11. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 2
12. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 60
```

## **Rationale**
Mixed-use (E + C3) provides existing permission precedent for both uses, easing intensification planning. EPC E-G creates MEES compliance pressure (cannot rent until improved - Pattern 8C). Flat roof + <15m height (3-5 storeys) = airspace potential (add 2-4 storeys). 10+ year hold signals tired landlord/trapped equity (Pattern 2A). <2 leaseholds = simple negotiation. 60%+ unconstrained plot = room for expansion.

## **Strengths**
- **Triple motivation:** Poor EPC + long hold + airspace potential
- **Existing mixed-use:** Planning precedent for intensification
- **Flat roof airspace:** Add 2-4 storeys luxury residential
- **MEES pressure:** Landlord cannot rent E-G rated properties (forced improvement or sale)
- **Lower competition:** Many developers avoid poor EPC complexity

## **Limitations**
- **EPC improvement costs:** £50k-£500k depending on building size
- **Mixed-use complexity:** Residential + commercial tenant management
- **Planning required:** Airspace not PDR for mixed-use (full planning application needed)
- **Structural survey critical:** Flat roof may not support additional storeys

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Zone 2 LPAs (Southwark, Islington, Hackney for volume)
2. **Week 2:** Target EPC F-G (strongest motivation) + flat roof + <12m height (3-4 storeys = most airspace potential)
3. **Month 2:** Approach with value proposition: "EPC compliance + refurbishment specialists, fast completion"
4. **Due diligence:** EPC improvement cost estimate, structural capacity assessment (airspace), GDV analysis
5. **Planning strategy:** Intensification (add 2-4 storeys) + refurbishment (EPC upgrade to B-C)
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months acquisition, 18-30 months refurb + intensification, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£30M (mixed-use values, 10-15% discount for poor EPC + long hold)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Refurbishment:** £200-£300/sqft (5k-80k sqft = £1M-£24M)
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Contingency (10%):** £600k-£5.5M
- **Total:** £10M-£45M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Triple-signal approach (EPC + long hold + airspace) is complex. Recommend testing **Approach A or C first** (simpler motivation stacks) before attempting multi-signal strategies.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Add EPC improvement cost screening step (desktop analysis)
3. Prioritize properties with F-G ratings (strongest MEES pressure)
4. Document EPC improvement case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach E: Class MA Broad Distress


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation) + Pattern 8C (EPC compliance) + Class MA PDR  
**Capital Required:** £12M-£55M  
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties (Zone 1, may skew to 10-15 with price refinement)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000
2. Sales listing price: is less than 60000000
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
```

## **Rationale**
Uses Class MA preset foundation (Preset #32) to surface office/retail blocks eligible for PDR. Layers **double distress**: insolvency (liquidation/administration) + EPC E-G. Long-hold signal (sold before 2015) adds price tension. 2k+ sqft floor (lower than Approach A's 10k) captures smaller opportunities. Broader filters than Approach A = higher volume but requires more screening.

## **Strengths**
- **Strong motivation stack:** Liquidation + poor EPC + long hold
- **PDR route:** Reduces planning risk (56-day approval)
- **Broader size range:** 2k+ sqft captures smaller opportunities (£5M-£20M range)
- **Higher volume:** Less restrictive filters = more properties to screen

## **Limitations**
- **Requires Class MA preset:** Must apply Preset #32 first, then add filters (two-step process)
- **Smaller floorplates:** 2k sqft properties may have limited conversion potential
- **EPC data gaps:** Poor EPC properties may have data quality issues
- **Tired assets:** Liquidation properties often have deferred maintenance (higher capex risk)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Step 1:** Apply SearchLand Preset #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
2. **Step 2:** Add filters above to preset results
3. **Week 1:** Screen by floor area bands: 2k-10k sqft (smaller), 10k-30k sqft (mid), 30k+ sqft (large)
4. **Week 2:** Prioritize liquidation status (strongest motivation) + EPC F-G (worst ratings)
5. **Month 2:** Contact liquidators/administrators directly (Land Registry for contact details)
6. **Due diligence:** Class MA eligibility confirmation (E use class, vacancy, size limits), building survey, GDV assessment
7. **Timeline:** 30-90 days acquisition, 12-18 months conversion, 24-30 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£55M (£5M-£20M for smaller properties, £20M-£55M for larger)
- **Building survey:** £5k-£30k
- **Class MA prior approval:** £5k-£15k
- **Conversion costs:** £200-£350/sqft (luxury spec, 2k-60k sqft = £400k-£21M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £1M-£9M
- **Total:** £12M-£55M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Apply SearchLand Preset #32 first
2. Copy filters above as refinements
3. Segment results by floor area (2k-10k, 10k-30k, 30k+)
4. Document which size bands yield best margins in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach F: Airspace Low-Rise Freehold


**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Airspace mismatch) + Pattern 23A (Capital-efficient airspace)  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£40M  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 (skews to Zone 2; Zone 1 likely 8-15)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000
2. Sales listing price: is less than 40000000
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Max building height (m): is less than 12
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets freehold commercial blocks with flat-roof airspace (Preset #23) where existing massing <12m (3-4 storeys) is below tall-building policy thresholds, enabling 1-3 additional storeys. Unbroken title (<1 leasehold) removes leaseholder consent risk. Mid-size (2k+ sqft) keeps buildability and GDV balance. Price filter £5M-£40M aligns with Zone 1-2 freehold values.

## **Strengths**
- **Minimal assembly risk:** <1 leasehold = simple ownership
- **Structural uplift:** Leverage existing land value by adding floors
- **JV/optionable:** Lower capital entry via airspace rights purchase
- **Low-rise focus:** <12m height = policy headroom for intensification

## **Limitations**
- **Structural capacity unknown:** Roof load capacity requires survey (£10k-£30k per property)
- **Planning sensitivity:** Some LPAs sensitive to massing increases, even on low-rise
- **Freehold availability:** Limited pool of freehold commercial with <1 leasehold
- **Requires Preset #23:** Must apply "Airspace: Commercial, no resi" preset first

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Step 1:** Apply SearchLand Preset #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"
2. **Step 2:** Add filters above to preset results
3. **Week 1:** Prioritize 4-8 storey candidates (<12m height = 3-4 storeys existing)
4. **Week 2:** Focus on post-1970 concrete frames (better load capacity)
5. **Month 2:** Triage by PTAL/high streets for design acceptability
6. **Due diligence:** Structural desktop assessment, rights-to-light quick check, planning feasibility study
7. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Freehold acquisition:** £5M-£40M
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Superstructure/fit-out:** £150-£250/sqft (1-3 storeys, 2k-20k sqft new = £300k-£5M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £550k-£4.5M
- **Total:** £5M-£40M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Similar to Approach B - structural survey budget must be clarified upfront (£10k-£30k per property). Recommend allocating £100k-£200k survey budget for screening 10-20 properties.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Apply SearchLand Preset #23 first
2. Copy filters above as refinements
3. Add structural survey screening step to workflow
4. Document survey findings (load capacity, frame type) in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach G: Brand Covenant Expiry - QSR/Retail


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 20A (Covenant release/lease-driven opportunity)  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£30M  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 (higher in Zone 2 high streets)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000
2. Sales listing price: is less than 30000000
3. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Use class: contains E
```

## **Rationale**
Captures QSR/retail blocks approaching covenant expiry where restrictive covenants (e.g., "no competing food use within 500m") lapse or renegotiation creates change-of-use leverage. EPC E-G adds regulatory pressure (MEES compliance). Lease expiry <2027 creates income cliff motivation. <1 leasehold = simple ownership. E use class provides Class MA conversion potential (PDR to residential) or bespoke resi via full planning.

## **Strengths**
- **Time-bound motivation:** Lease expiry date known (creates urgency)
- **Covenant fall-away:** Restrictive covenants lapse at expiry, enabling alternative uses
- **Strong locations:** Prime retail pitches convert to high-value residential
- **Dual exit options:** Class MA PDR (if vacant) or full planning reposition

## **Limitations**
- **Over-rented sites:** Some properties may have above-market rents (reduces motivation)
- **Dilapidations disputes:** Potential legal issues with outgoing tenants
- **Covenant release complexity:** Some covenants require negotiation/legal review (not automatic lapse)
- **Vacancy requirement:** Class MA needs vacancy (if tenant renews, PDR not available)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Zone 2 high streets (Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Hackney)
2. **Week 2:** Sort by lease expiry proximity (≤12 months = highest motivation)
3. **Month 2:** Pull leases from Land Registry for assignment/restriction clauses
4. **Due diligence:** Check vacancy status (for Class MA eligibility), covenant review, dual-exit modeling (renewal uplift vs resi conversion)
5. **Negotiation strategy:** Bid with optionality (acquire pre-expiry, convert post-vacancy)
6. **Timeline:** 3-6 months acquisition, 12-18 months conversion (if vacant), 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£30M (Zone 2 retail/QSR values, 10-15% discount for expiring lease + poor EPC)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£300k
- **Conversion costs:** £120-£220/sqft (strip-out/refurb, or £200-£300/sqft for full resi conversion)
- **Legal (covenant review):** £10k-£30k
- **Contingency (10%):** £600k-£3.3M
- **Total:** £5M-£30M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Prioritize properties with lease expiry ≤12 months
3. Create covenant review checklist (assignment clauses, restrictions, lapse conditions)
4. Document covenant case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach H: Airspace Rights Purchase (Capital-Efficient)


**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Capital-efficient airspace acquisition)  
**Capital Required:** £2M-£10M (airspace rights only, not full building)  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 (highly targeted, Zone 1)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes]
3. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO, C2 - Residential institutions, C1 - Hotels]
4. Developed area (sqft): is greater than 3229
5. Developed area percentage: is less than or equal to 30
6. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to true
7. Max building height on title (m): is less than 25
8. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
9. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
10. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND is less than 60000000
11. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Listed Building(s) in plot, Conservation Area]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets Zone 1 commercial buildings where Landmass can purchase **airspace rights only** (not full building) for fraction of cost. <25m height = low-to-mid-rise with vertical extension potential. <3 leaseholds = simpler rights negotiation. Developed area ≤30% = significant unused plot capacity. Conservation Area exclusion = higher airspace approval probability. Capital-efficient entry to Zone 1 premium market.

## **Strengths**
- **Capital efficient:** £2M-£10M airspace rights vs £10M-£60M full building purchase
- **High value creation:** Adding luxury flats at £2,000-£4,000 psf (Zone 1) creates substantial margin
- **Targeted approach:** Directly addresses Landmass's airspace PD strategy
- **Prime locations:** Zone 1 focus (Westminster, K&C) = highest residential values

## **Limitations**
- **Very low deal flow:** Flat roof + low height + simple ownership in Zone 1 is rare
- **Negotiation complexity:** Acquiring airspace rights requires complex freeholder negotiation
- **Structural risk:** Existing building must support additional floors (survey critical)
- **Planning required:** Airspace not automatic PDR (approval needed)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter within Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea only (Zone 1 premium)
2. **Week 2:** Identify buildings with <25m height (6-8 storeys = 2-4 storeys airspace potential)
3. **Month 2:** Approach freeholder off-market to negotiate airspace rights purchase
4. **Due diligence:** Structural survey (£10k-£30k), rights-to-light analysis, planning feasibility study
5. **Deal structure:** Option agreement (£50k-£200k deposit) while securing planning
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £2M-£10M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Option deposit:** £50k-£200k
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Construction:** £250-£350/sqft (2-4 storeys, 5k-20k sqft new = £1.25M-£7M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £350k-£1.7M
- **Total:** £2M-£10M (airspace rights + construction)

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Airspace rights negotiation is highly complex. Recommend testing **full building acquisition strategies (Approaches A, C, E) first** before attempting rights-only deals.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Add freeholder negotiation strategy document
3. Create airspace rights option agreement template
4. Document negotiation case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach I: Class MA Dual Regulation (Zone 2)


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8C (EPC compliance pressure) + Pattern 8B (Lease expiry)  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£20M (Zone 2 focus)  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(c)(i) - Financial constants, E(c)(ii) - Professional constants, E(c)(iii) - Other commercial constants, E(d) - Indoor sport, E(e) - Provision of medical or health constants, E(f) - Creche, day nursery or day centre, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
3. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND less than 40000
5. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
6. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
7. Ownership type: is one of [Corporate, Company]
8. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 20000000
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

## **Rationale**
Creates "perfect storm" of motivation by combining **dual regulatory pressure**: (1) EPC E-G = cannot let without £50k-£500k upgrades (MEES), (2) Lease expiry <2027 = income cliff approaching. Corporate ownership = rational financial decision-makers (institutional divestment). Zone 2 focus keeps prices £5M-£20M (Landmass sweet spot). 10k-40k sqft = viable Class MA conversion scale.

## **Strengths**
- **Strong motivation:** EPC pressure + lease expiry = double regulatory squeeze
- **High volume:** Common in aging Zone 2 commercial stock (20-40 properties expected)
- **Directly actionable:** Every property is Class MA conversion candidate
- **Corporate sellers:** Professional decision-makers, faster transactions

## **Limitations**
- **Competition:** Other developers aware of regulatory pressures
- **Refurbishment costs:** Poor EPC implies substantial refurb needed (£50k-£500k)
- **Lease complexity:** Expiring leases require management/surrender negotiations
- **Class MA restrictions:** 2-year prior use, size limits apply

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney (Zone 2 LPAs)
2. **Week 2:** Screen for earliest lease expiry dates + lowest EPC ratings (highest motivation)
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize vacant properties (Class MA ready, no tenant surrender needed)
4. **Month 2:** Approach corporate sellers with value proposition: "Bypass EPC costs and void period, immediate Class MA conversion"
5. **Due diligence:** Class MA eligibility confirmation, EPC improvement cost estimate, GDV assessment
6. **Timeline:** 3-6 months acquisition, 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£15M (Zone 2 commercial values, 15-20% discount for dual motivation)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Class MA prior approval:** £5k-£15k
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (10k-40k sqft = £1.5M-£10M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £700k-£2.6M
- **Total:** £5M-£20M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Prioritize properties with lease expiry ≤12 months + EPC F-G
3. Create corporate seller approach script emphasizing dual-cost avoidance
4. Document dual-motivation case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach J: Zone 1 Liquidation Land Grab


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Forced sale/liquidation) - aggressive distressed asset acquisition  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£60M (off-market, no price filter needed)  
**Expected Results:** 2-10 (very rare but extremely high value)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions]
4. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
5. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
6. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 20000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI]
```

## **Rationale**
Highly aggressive, off-market strategy targeting **ultimate seller motivation**: forced sale by administrators. No price filter (deals conducted off-market with small pool of well-funded buyers). 20k+ sqft = large prime commercial buildings (£20M-£60M Zone 1 values). Administrator's legal duty to dispose = 20-30% discount potential. Targets prime Zone 1 canvases for Landmass's luxury conversion expertise.

## **Strengths**
- **Maximum discount potential:** 20-30% below market (forced sales)
- **Reduced competition:** Off-market deals avoid bidding wars
- **Speed advantage:** Administrators motivated for quick, clean closures
- **Creates margin:** Acquisition discount drives 20%+ profit margin

## **Limitations**
- **Extremely low deal flow:** Corporate liquidations of £20M+ freehold assets are very rare
- **High risk:** Properties may have hidden legal/structural issues
- **Requires strong capital:** Must demonstrate cash funds and ability to close without financing
- **Time-sensitive:** Requires weekly monitoring to catch opportunities immediately

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Setup:** Run search weekly across Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, K&C, City of London) to catch new listings
2. **Alert system:** Configure SearchLand alerts for new liquidation/administration entries
3. **Week 1:** Contact administrator within 24-48 hours of listing (first credible buyer advantage)
4. **Week 2:** Rapid due diligence: Desktop legal review, structural desktop assessment, GDV quick estimate
5. **Month 2:** Proof of funds letter, non-binding offer within 7 days
6. **Timeline:** 30-60 days acquisition (administrators favor speed), 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £10M-£60M (20-30% below market value)
- **Rapid due diligence:** £20k-£50k (accelerated timeline)
- **Legal fees:** £30k-£100k (complex distressed sale)
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (20k+ sqft = £3M-£5M+)
- **Contingency (15%, higher for distressed):** £2M-£9M
- **Total:** £10M-£60M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Setup weekly automated search (configure alerts)
3. Create administrator approach protocol (24-48 hour response SLA)
4. Prepare proof of funds template for rapid deployment
5. Document liquidation case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## Approach K: Class MA Multi-Signal Distress (Zone 2)


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation) + Pattern 8C (EPC) + Pattern 8B (Lease expiry) - comprehensive distress  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£20M (Zone 2 focus)  
**Expected Results:** 20-60 properties (broad search, refined by motivation)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(c)(i) - Financial constants, E(c)(ii) - Professional constants, E(c)(iii) - Other commercial constants, E(d) - Indoor sport, E(e) - Provision of medical or health constants, E(f) - Creche, day nursery or day centre, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 1
3. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

## **Rationale**
Comprehensive multi-signal distress strategy combining: (1) Liquidation/administration = forced sale, (2) EPC E-G = MEES compliance pressure, (3) Lease expiry <2027 = income cliff. Zone 2 focus (0.05-1 acres = manageable sites) keeps capital £5M-£20M. Class MA eligible (E use classes). Expected viable rate 30-50% based on preset performance + refinement patterns.

## **Strengths**
- **Triple motivation:** Liquidation + poor EPC + lease expiry = maximum discount potential
- **High volume:** Zone 2 aging commercial stock yields 20-60 properties
- **PDR route:** Class MA reduces planning risk (56-day approval)
- **Comprehensive search:** Captures all major distress signals simultaneously

## **Limitations**
- **Requires manual LPA filtering:** Must apply Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney, Wandsworth, Lambeth manually
- **Liquidation properties:** May have complex legal issues (extended due diligence needed)
- **EPC improvement costs:** £50k-£500k required before rental
- **Class MA restrictions:** 2-year prior use, size limits (100-8,000 sqm)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney (Zone 2 LPAs)
2. **Week 2:** Prioritize properties with triple motivation (liquidation + EPC F-G + lease expiry ≤12 months)
3. **Week 3:** Target sites with flat roofs (airspace upside potential)
4. **Month 2:** Contact administrators directly for liquidation properties (fast closure advantage)
5. **Due diligence:** Class MA eligibility check, EPC improvement cost estimate, legal review, GDV assessment
6. **Timeline:** 30-90 days acquisition (liquidations), 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£15M (Zone 2 values, 20-25% discount for triple motivation)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Class MA prior approval:** £5k-£15k
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (0.05-1 acre = 2k-40k sqft = £300k-£10M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £600k-£2.6M
- **Total:** £5M-£20M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Create triple-motivation screening checklist (liquidation + EPC F-G + lease expiry ≤12m)
3. Add flat roof screening for airspace upside

## Approach L: Airspace + Distress (Zone 1-2)


**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Airspace) + Pattern 2A (Long hold) + Pattern 8C (EPC)  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£40M  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (commercial focus narrows results)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(c)(i) - Financial constants, E(c)(ii) - Professional constants, E(c)(iii) - Other commercial constants, E(d) - Indoor sport, E(e) - Provision of medical or health constants, E(f) - Creche, day nursery or day centre, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
2. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
3. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 2
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

## **Rationale**
Combines airspace potential (flat roof, commercial, no residential) with distress signals: (1) Long institutional hold (sold before 2015 = trapped equity), (2) Poor EPC (E-G = MEES compliance pressure). 0.1-2 acres = viable intensification scale. Conservation Area exclusion = higher airspace approval probability. Expected viable rate 40-60% based on preset + refinement patterns.

## **Strengths**
- **Airspace + motivation:** Flat roof + long hold + poor EPC = triple upside
- **Lower upfront capital:** Airspace rights focus (£2M-£10M) vs full building purchase
- **Distressed sellers:** Long hold + EPC pressure = 10-20% discount potential
- **Pure commercial focus:** Excludes residential = targets institutional airspace opportunities

## **Limitations**
- **Structural survey critical:** £5k-£15k per property to confirm load capacity
- **Freeholder negotiation:** Complex airspace rights negotiation (if not purchasing freehold)
- **Planning required:** Airspace not PDR (full planning application needed)
- **Institutional long holds:** May have complex ownership structures

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City of London, Camden (Zone 1), then Tower Hamlets, Southwark (Zone 2)
2. **Week 2:** Prioritize 5-12m height (2-4 storeys = 2-4 additional storeys potential)
3. **Month 2:** Use long hold signal for direct owner outreach (off-market approach)
4. **Due diligence:** Structural survey (£5k-£15k), rights-to-light analysis, planning feasibility study
5. **Deal structure:** Secure airspace options (£50k-£200k deposits) while obtaining planning
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £2M-£10M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Option deposit:** £50k-£200k
- **Structural survey:** £5k-£15k per property
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Construction:** £250-£350/sqft (2-4 storeys, 5k-20k sqft new = £1.25M-£7M)
- **EPC improvement (if buying full building):** £50k-£500k
- **Contingency (10%):** £350k-£1.8M
- **Total:** £10M-£40M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Similar to Approaches B, F, H - structural survey budget must be clarified upfront (£5k-£15k per property). Recommend allocating £100k-£200k survey budget for screening 15-20 properties.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Add structural survey screening step (budget £100k-£200k for 15-20 properties)
3. Prioritize post-1970 concrete frames (better load capacity)
4. Document airspace + distress case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
9. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

## **Rationale**
No preset directly targets expired planning permissions, so custom filters combine: (1) Proposal keywords (residential/storey = development intent), (2) Application history (old submissions pre-2020 + dwelling numbers = likely lapsed consents), (3) Motivation signals (long hold, liquidation, poor EPC). Targets sites with planning precedent + sunk costs = motivated sellers. Expected viable rate 20-40% based on pattern analysis.

## **Strengths**
- **Planning precedent:** Expired consents provide historical approval (reduces risk vs greenfield)
- **Strong motivation:** Sunk costs + distress signals (liquidation + EPC + long hold)
- **Refurb focus:** Aligns with Landmass expertise (unmodernized buildings)
- **Broader than PDR:** Includes full planning consents (not just Class MA)

## **Limitations**
- **No direct "expired" filter:** Proxies via date + proposal (requires manual screening)
- **Re-application required:** Expired consents need re-submission (£20k-£100k cost, 6-12 months)
- **May include non-lapsed applications:** Manual planning history check needed
- **Higher capital:** Full acquisitions (£10M-£60M) vs airspace rights

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City of London, Camden (Zone 1 premium)
2. **Week 2:** Manually check planning history for lapsed consents (via council planning portal)
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize liquidation properties (fastest closures)
4. **Month 2:** Approach administrators with value proposition: "Revive sunk planning costs, immediate refurbishment"
5. **Due diligence:** Planning re-application feasibility, structural survey, EPC improvement cost estimate, GDV assessment
6. **Timeline:** 30-90 days acquisition (liquidations), 6-12 months re-application, 12-18 months refurbishment, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £10M-£50M (Zone 1-2 values, 15-20% discount for distress + lapsed planning)
- **Planning re-application:** £20k-£100k
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Refurbishment:** £150-£250/sqft (0.05-2 acres = 2k-80k sqft = £300k-£20M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £1.5M-£7M
- **Total:** £10M-£60M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** No direct "expired planning" filter in SearchLand - requires manual screening of planning history. Recommend testing **Approaches A, C, E (simpler Class MA/lease expiry strategies) first** before attempting expired planning searches.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Create manual planning history screening protocol (council planning portal checks)
3. Document which LPAs have good planning data (Westminster, Camden, K&C typically best)
4. Build expired planning case study database in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Total Approaches Generated:** 13 (A-M)

**Status Breakdown:**
- ✅ **VALID (Ready to test):** 8 approaches (A, C, E, G, I, J, K)
- ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL (Minor issues):** 5 approaches (B, D, F, H, L, M)
- ❌ **INVALID:** 0 approaches

**Recommended Testing Sequence:**

### **Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Highest Motivation Signals**
1. **Approach A** - Class MA Premium Liquidation (strongest motivation: forced sale + derelict + low EPC)
2. **Approach J** - Zone 1 Liquidation Land Grab (maximum discount potential: 20-30%)
3. **Approach C** - Lease Expiry Premium Office (dual motivation: lease expiry + EPC)

### **Phase 2 (Week 3-4): High-Volume Zone 2**
4. **Approach I** - Class MA Dual Regulation (Zone 2 focus, EPC + lease expiry)
5. **Approach K** - Class MA Multi-Signal Distress (comprehensive Zone 2 coverage)
6. **Approach G** - Brand Covenant Expiry (unique QSR/retail angle)

### **Phase 3 (Month 2): Airspace Strategies**
7. **Approach H** - Airspace Rights Purchase (capital-efficient, Zone 1)
8. **Approach B** - Airspace Corporate Long Hold (long hold motivation)
9. **Approach F** - Airspace Low-Rise Freehold (simple ownership)

### **Phase 4 (Month 3): Complex/Experimental**
10. **Approach E** - Class MA Broad Distress (broader filters than Approach A)
11. **Approach D** - Mixed-Use EPC Intensification (triple-signal complexity)
12. **Approach L** - Airspace + Distress (airspace + long hold + EPC combo)
13. **Approach M** - Expired Planning + Distress (requires manual screening)

**Key Success Factors:**
- ✅ Landmass has **£10M-£60M capital** = competitive advantage for liquidations/distressed sales
- ✅ **Refurbishment expertise** = handle poor EPC, derelict buildings (avoid competition)
- ✅ **Zone 1-2 luxury focus** = extract maximum GDV from conversions
- ✅ **PDR routes** (Class MA) = reduce planning risk vs full applications

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Structural surveys:** Budget £100k-£200k for airspace screening (15-20 properties)
- **EPC improvement:** Add 10-20% contingency (£50k-£500k per property)
- **Liquidation due diligence:** Accelerated timeline (24-48 hours) but thorough legal review
- **Planning risk:** Focus on PDR (Class MA) or policy-supported intensification (PTAL 4+)

**Expected Total Pipeline:** 150-350 properties across all approaches  
**Viable Rate (Conservative):** 20-40% = 30-140 exceptional opportunities  
**Timeline to First Acquisition:** 30-90 days (Approaches A, J via liquidation fast-track)
