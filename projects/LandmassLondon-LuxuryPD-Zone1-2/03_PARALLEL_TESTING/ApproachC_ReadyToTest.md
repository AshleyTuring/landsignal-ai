```
1. Use class: contains any [E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), B2]
2. NOT Use class: contains [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 15000 AND less than 200000
5. Lease end date: is before 31/12/2026
6. Ownership type: contains any [Corporate, Company]
7. EPC rating: contains any [D, E, F, G]
8. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
10. NOT Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
```

## **Rationale**
Lease expiry <2026 creates 6-12 month motivation window (Pattern 8B - income cliff). Corporate ownership = institutional rationalization opportunity. Low EPC (D-G) adds second motivation layer: cannot re-let without £50k-£500k EPC improvement (MEES regulations). 15k-200k sqft targets £15M-£60M Zone 1-2 premium office values. PTAL 4+ + <500m train = luxury residential conversion potential.

## **Strengths**
- **Predictable motivation timeline:** Lease expiry date known (6-12 month window)
- **Double motivation:** Expiring lease + poor EPC (cannot easily re-let)
- **Class MA potential:** Large offices often eligible for PDR conversion
- **Premium locations:** High PTAL, <500m train = luxury residential demand
- **Corporate sellers:** Professional decision-makers, fast transactions

## **Limitations**
- **High capital requirement:** £20M-£80M (top of Landmass budget range)
- **Tenant renewal risk:** Tenant may renew lease (motivation disappears)
- **EPC improvement costs:** £50k-£500k required before conversion
- **Commercial market competition:** Office recovery may attract commercial buyers

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City of London, Camden (Zone 1 premium)
2. **Week 2:** Target lease expiry 6-12 months out (sweet spot for motivation)
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize vacant post-expiry properties (strongest signal: no income, carrying costs £50k-£200k/month)
4. **Month 2:** Approach with value proposition: "Fast completion, avoid void period, capital ready"
5. **Due diligence:** Class MA eligibility check, structural survey, EPC improvement cost estimate, GDV assessment
6. **Negotiation strategy:** Quantify void costs vs immediate sale (£50k-£200k/month saving)
7. **Timeline:** 3-6 months acquisition, 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £15M-£60M (Zone 1-2 office values, 10-20% discount for expiring lease)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (15k-200k sqft = £2.25M-£50M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £2M-£11M
- **Total:** £20M-£80M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Prioritize properties with lease expiry 6-12 months out (add manual date screening)
3. Create landlord approach script emphasizing void cost savings
4. Document void cost benchmarks in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
