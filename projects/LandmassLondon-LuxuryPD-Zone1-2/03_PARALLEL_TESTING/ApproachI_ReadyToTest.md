```

## **Rationale**
Creates "perfect storm" of motivation by combining **dual regulatory pressure**: (1) EPC E-G = cannot let without £50k-£500k upgrades (MEES), (2) Lease expiry <2027 = income cliff approaching. Corporate ownership = rational financial decision-makers (institutional divestment). Zone 2 focus keeps prices £5M-£20M (Landmass sweet spot). 10k-40k sqft = viable Class MA conversion scale.

## **Strengths**
- **Strong motivation:** EPC pressure + lease expiry = double regulatory squeeze
- **High volume:** Common in aging Zone 2 commercial stock (20-40 properties expected)
- **Directly actionable:** Every property is Class MA conversion candidate
- **Corporate sellers:** Professional decision-makers, faster transactions

## **Limitations**
- **Competition:** Other developers aware of regulatory pressures
- **Refurbishment costs:** Poor EPC implies substantial refurb needed (£50k-£500k)
- **Lease complexity:** Expiring leases require management/surrender negotiations
- **Class MA restrictions:** 2-year prior use, size limits apply

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney (Zone 2 LPAs)
2. **Week 2:** Screen for earliest lease expiry dates + lowest EPC ratings (highest motivation)
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize vacant properties (Class MA ready, no tenant surrender needed)
4. **Month 2:** Approach corporate sellers with value proposition: "Bypass EPC costs and void period, immediate Class MA conversion"
5. **Due diligence:** Class MA eligibility confirmation, EPC improvement cost estimate, GDV assessment
6. **Timeline:** 3-6 months acquisition, 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£15M (Zone 2 commercial values, 15-20% discount for dual motivation)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Class MA prior approval:** £5k-£15k
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (10k-40k sqft = £1.5M-£10M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £700k-£2.6M
- **Total:** £5M-£20M
