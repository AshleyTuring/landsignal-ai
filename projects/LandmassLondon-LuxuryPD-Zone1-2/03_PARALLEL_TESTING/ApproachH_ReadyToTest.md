**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Capital-efficient airspace acquisition)  
**Capital Required:** £2M-£10M (airspace rights only, not full building)  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 (highly targeted, Zone 1)

```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes]
3. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO, C2 - Residential institutions, C1 - Hotels]
4. Developed area (sqft): is greater than 3229
5. Developed area percentage: is less than or equal to 30
6. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to true
7. Max building height on title (m): is less than 25
8. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
9. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
10. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND is less than 60000000
11. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Listed Building(s) in plot, Conservation Area]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets Zone 1 commercial buildings where Landmass can purchase **airspace rights only** (not full building) for fraction of cost. <25m height = low-to-mid-rise with vertical extension potential. <3 leaseholds = simpler rights negotiation. Developed area ≤30% = significant unused plot capacity. Conservation Area exclusion = higher airspace approval probability. Capital-efficient entry to Zone 1 premium market.

## **Strengths**
- **Capital efficient:** £2M-£10M airspace rights vs £10M-£60M full building purchase
- **High value creation:** Adding luxury flats at £2,000-£4,000 psf (Zone 1) creates substantial margin
- **Targeted approach:** Directly addresses Landmass's airspace PD strategy
- **Prime locations:** Zone 1 focus (Westminster, K&C) = highest residential values

## **Limitations**
- **Very low deal flow:** Flat roof + low height + simple ownership in Zone 1 is rare
- **Negotiation complexity:** Acquiring airspace rights requires complex freeholder negotiation
- **Structural risk:** Existing building must support additional floors (survey critical)
- **Planning required:** Airspace not automatic PDR (approval needed)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter within Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea only (Zone 1 premium)
2. **Week 2:** Identify buildings with <25m height (6-8 storeys = 2-4 storeys airspace potential)
3. **Month 2:** Approach freeholder off-market to negotiate airspace rights purchase
4. **Due diligence:** Structural survey (£10k-£30k), rights-to-light analysis, planning feasibility study
5. **Deal structure:** Option agreement (£50k-£200k deposit) while securing planning
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £2M-£10M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Option deposit:** £50k-£200k
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Construction:** £250-£350/sqft (2-4 storeys, 5k-20k sqft new = £1.25M-£7M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £350k-£1.7M
- **Total:** £2M-£10M (airspace rights + construction)

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Airspace rights negotiation is highly complex. Recommend testing **full building acquisition strategies (Approaches A, C, E) first** before attempting rights-only deals.
