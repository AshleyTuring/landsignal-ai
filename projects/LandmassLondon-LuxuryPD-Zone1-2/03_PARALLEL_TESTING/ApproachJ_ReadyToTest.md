**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Forced sale/liquidation) - aggressive distressed asset acquisition  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£60M (off-market, no price filter needed)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions]

6. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 20000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI]
```

## **Rationale**
Highly aggressive, off-market strategy targeting **ultimate seller motivation**: forced sale by administrators. No price filter (deals conducted off-market with small pool of well-funded buyers). 20k+ sqft = large prime commercial buildings (£20M-£60M Zone 1 values). Administrator's legal duty to dispose = 20-30% discount potential. Targets prime Zone 1 canvases for Landmass's luxury conversion expertise.

## **Strengths**
- **Maximum discount potential:** 20-30% below market (forced sales)
- **Reduced competition:** Off-market deals avoid bidding wars
- **Speed advantage:** Administrators motivated for quick, clean closures
- **Creates margin:** Acquisition discount drives 20%+ profit margin

## **Limitations**
- **Extremely low deal flow:** Corporate liquidations of £20M+ freehold assets are very rare
- **High risk:** Properties may have hidden legal/structural issues
- **Requires strong capital:** Must demonstrate cash funds and ability to close without financing
- **Time-sensitive:** Requires weekly monitoring to catch opportunities immediately

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Setup:** Run search weekly across Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, K&C, City of London) to catch new listings
2. **Alert system:** Configure SearchLand alerts for new liquidation/administration entries
3. **Week 1:** Contact administrator within 24-48 hours of listing (first credible buyer advantage)
4. **Week 2:** Rapid due diligence: Desktop legal review, structural desktop assessment, GDV quick estimate
5. **Month 2:** Proof of funds letter, non-binding offer within 7 days
6. **Timeline:** 30-60 days acquisition (administrators favor speed), 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £10M-£60M (20-30% below market value)
- **Rapid due diligence:** £20k-£50k (accelerated timeline)
- **Legal fees:** £30k-£100k (complex distressed sale)
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (20k+ sqft = £3M-£5M+)
- **Contingency (15%, higher for distressed):** £2M-£9M
- **Total:** £10M-£60M

## **Next Steps**
