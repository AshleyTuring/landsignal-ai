# **APPROACH B: Airspace Corporate Long Hold**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2A (Long corporate hold/tired landlord) + Airspace development  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£30M  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1-2)

```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8]
3. NOT Use class: contains [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
4. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 8000 AND less than 100000
6. Max building height on title (m): is less than 18
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 1.5
8. Ownership type: contains any [Corporate, Company]
9. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2010
10. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
11. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
12. NOT Planning constraints: contains any [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

## **Rationale**
Flat roof + low-rise (<18m = 3-6 storeys) creates headroom for 3-5 additional storeys. Corporate ownership + 15+ year hold signals trapped equity/asset rationalization opportunity (Pattern 2A). <3 leaseholds simplifies negotiation. PTAL 4+ provides policy support for intensification (London Plan density guidance). Conservation Area exclusion increases airspace approval probability.

## **Strengths**
- **Lower upfront capital:** Airspace rights purchase cheaper than full freehold acquisition
- **Corporate sellers:** Professional decision-makers, faster negotiation
- **Long hold motivation:** 15+ years = trapped equity creates rationalization pressure
- **Policy support:** PTAL 4+ areas favor intensification (London Plan)
- **Existing infrastructure:** Utilities, access, structural base already present

## **Limitations**
- **Structural survey critical:** £10k-£30k cost, risk of unsuitable load capacity
- **Planning not guaranteed:** Airspace requires approval (not PDR like Class MA)
- **Party wall complexity:** Zone 1-2 dense urban context complicates agreements
- **Freeholder negotiation:** If purchasing airspace rights only, complex deal structuring required

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City, Camden, K&C (Zone 1)
2. **Week 2:** Expand to Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington if <10 results
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize corporate ownership + 15+ year hold + flat roof + <12m height (3-4 storeys = most airspace potential)
4. **Month 2:** Approach freeholders with dual offer: (a) Airspace purchase, or (b) JV structure
5. **Due diligence:** Structural survey (£10k-£30k), rights-to-light analysis, planning feasibility study
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £1M-£5M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Construction:** £250-£350/sqft (3-5 storeys, 10k-40k sqft new = £2.5M-£14M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £400k-£2M
- **Total:** £10M-£30M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Structural survey budget must be clarified upfront (£10k-£30k per property). Recommend allocating £100k-£200k survey budget for screening 10-20 properties before committing to acquisitions.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Add structural survey screening step to workflow
3. Document survey findings in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
4. Update capital breakdown based on actual survey costs
