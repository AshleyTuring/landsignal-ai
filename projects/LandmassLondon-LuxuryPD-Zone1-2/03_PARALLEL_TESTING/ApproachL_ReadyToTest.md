# **APPROACH L: Airspace + Distress (Zone 1-2)**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Airspace) + Pattern 2A (Long hold) + Pattern 8C (EPC)  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£40M  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (commercial focus narrows results)

1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(c)(i) - Financial constants, E(c)(ii) - Professional constants, E(c)(iii) - Other commercial constants, E(d) - Indoor sport, E(e) - Provision of medical or health constants, E(f) - Creche, day nursery or day centre, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
2. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
3. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 2
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

## **Rationale**
Combines airspace potential (flat roof, commercial, no residential) with distress signals: (1) Long institutional hold (sold before 2015 = trapped equity), (2) Poor EPC (E-G = MEES compliance pressure). 0.1-2 acres = viable intensification scale. Conservation Area exclusion = higher airspace approval probability. Expected viable rate 40-60% based on preset + refinement patterns.

## **Strengths**
- **Airspace + motivation:** Flat roof + long hold + poor EPC = triple upside
- **Lower upfront capital:** Airspace rights focus (£2M-£10M) vs full building purchase
- **Distressed sellers:** Long hold + EPC pressure = 10-20% discount potential
- **Pure commercial focus:** Excludes residential = targets institutional airspace opportunities

## **Limitations**
- **Structural survey critical:** £5k-£15k per property to confirm load capacity
- **Freeholder negotiation:** Complex airspace rights negotiation (if not purchasing freehold)
- **Planning required:** Airspace not PDR (full planning application needed)
- **Institutional long holds:** May have complex ownership structures

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City of London, Camden (Zone 1), then Tower Hamlets, Southwark (Zone 2)
2. **Week 2:** Prioritize 5-12m height (2-4 storeys = 2-4 additional storeys potential)
3. **Month 2:** Use long hold signal for direct owner outreach (off-market approach)
4. **Due diligence:** Structural survey (£5k-£15k), rights-to-light analysis, planning feasibility study
5. **Deal structure:** Secure airspace options (£50k-£200k deposits) while obtaining planning
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £2M-£10M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Option deposit:** £50k-£200k
- **Structural survey:** £5k-£15k per property
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Construction:** £250-£350/sqft (2-4 storeys, 5k-20k sqft new = £1.25M-£7M)
- **EPC improvement (if buying full building):** £50k-£500k
- **Contingency (10%):** £350k-£1.8M
- **Total:** £10M-£40M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Similar to Approaches B, F, H - structural survey budget must be clarified upfront (£5k-£15k per property). Recommend allocating £100k-£200k survey budget for screening 15-20 properties.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Add structural survey screening step (budget £100k-£200k for 15-20 properties)
3. Prioritize post-1970 concrete frames (better load capacity)
4. Document airspace + distress case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
