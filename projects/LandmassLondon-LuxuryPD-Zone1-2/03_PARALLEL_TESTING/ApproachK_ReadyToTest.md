# **APPROACH K: Class MA Multi-Signal Distress (Zone 2)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation) + Pattern 8C (EPC) + Pattern 8B (Lease expiry) - comprehensive distress  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£20M (Zone 2 focus)  
**Expected Results:** 20-60 properties (broad search, refined by motivation)

1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(c)(i) - Financial constants, E(c)(ii) - Professional constants, E(c)(iii) - Other commercial constants, E(d) - Indoor sport, E(e) - Provision of medical or health constants, E(f) - Creche, day nursery or day centre, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 1
3. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

## **Rationale**
Comprehensive multi-signal distress strategy combining: (1) Liquidation/administration = forced sale, (2) EPC E-G = MEES compliance pressure, (3) Lease expiry <2027 = income cliff. Zone 2 focus (0.05-1 acres = manageable sites) keeps capital £5M-£20M. Class MA eligible (E use classes). Expected viable rate 30-50% based on preset performance + refinement patterns.

## **Strengths**
- **Triple motivation:** Liquidation + poor EPC + lease expiry = maximum discount potential
- **High volume:** Zone 2 aging commercial stock yields 20-60 properties
- **PDR route:** Class MA reduces planning risk (56-day approval)
- **Comprehensive search:** Captures all major distress signals simultaneously

## **Limitations**
- **Requires manual LPA filtering:** Must apply Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney, Wandsworth, Lambeth manually
- **Liquidation properties:** May have complex legal issues (extended due diligence needed)
- **EPC improvement costs:** £50k-£500k required before rental
- **Class MA restrictions:** 2-year prior use, size limits (100-8,000 sqm)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney (Zone 2 LPAs)
2. **Week 2:** Prioritize properties with triple motivation (liquidation + EPC F-G + lease expiry ≤12 months)
3. **Week 3:** Target sites with flat roofs (airspace upside potential)
4. **Month 2:** Contact administrators directly for liquidation properties (fast closure advantage)
5. **Due diligence:** Class MA eligibility check, EPC improvement cost estimate, legal review, GDV assessment
6. **Timeline:** 30-90 days acquisition (liquidations), 12-18 months conversion, 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£15M (Zone 2 values, 20-25% discount for triple motivation)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Class MA prior approval:** £5k-£15k
- **Conversion costs:** £150-£250/sqft (0.05-1 acre = 2k-40k sqft = £300k-£10M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £600k-£2.6M
- **Total:** £5M-£20M

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Create triple-motivation screening checklist (liquidation + EPC F-G + lease expiry ≤12m)
3. Add flat roof screening for airspace upside
4. Document multi-signal case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
