# **APPROACH G: Brand Covenant Expiry - QSR/Retail**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 20A (Covenant release/lease-driven opportunity)  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£30M  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 (higher in Zone 2 high streets)

```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000
2. Sales listing price: is less than 30000000
3. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Use class: contains E
```

## **Rationale**
Captures QSR/retail blocks approaching covenant expiry where restrictive covenants (e.g., "no competing food use within 500m") lapse or renegotiation creates change-of-use leverage. EPC E-G adds regulatory pressure (MEES compliance). Lease expiry <2027 creates income cliff motivation. <1 leasehold = simple ownership. E use class provides Class MA conversion potential (PDR to residential) or bespoke resi via full planning.

## **Strengths**
- **Time-bound motivation:** Lease expiry date known (creates urgency)
- **Covenant fall-away:** Restrictive covenants lapse at expiry, enabling alternative uses
- **Strong locations:** Prime retail pitches convert to high-value residential
- **Dual exit options:** Class MA PDR (if vacant) or full planning reposition

## **Limitations**
- **Over-rented sites:** Some properties may have above-market rents (reduces motivation)
- **Dilapidations disputes:** Potential legal issues with outgoing tenants
- **Covenant release complexity:** Some covenants require negotiation/legal review (not automatic lapse)
- **Vacancy requirement:** Class MA needs vacancy (if tenant renews, PDR not available)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Zone 2 high streets (Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Hackney)
2. **Week 2:** Sort by lease expiry proximity (≤12 months = highest motivation)
3. **Month 2:** Pull leases from Land Registry for assignment/restriction clauses
4. **Due diligence:** Check vacancy status (for Class MA eligibility), covenant review, dual-exit modeling (renewal uplift vs resi conversion)
5. **Negotiation strategy:** Bid with optionality (acquire pre-expiry, convert post-vacancy)
6. **Timeline:** 3-6 months acquisition, 12-18 months conversion (if vacant), 18-24 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£30M (Zone 2 retail/QSR values, 10-15% discount for expiring lease + poor EPC)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£300k
- **Conversion costs:** £120-£220/sqft (strip-out/refurb, or £200-£300/sqft for full resi conversion)
- **Legal (covenant review):** £10k-£30k
- **Contingency (10%):** £600k-£3.3M
- **Total:** £5M-£30M
