# **APPROACH M: Expired Planning + Distress**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Custom (no preset) - revive lapsed consents with distress signals  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£60M (Zone 1-2 full acquisitions)  
**Expected Results:** 5-20 properties (expired planning is rare)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Proposal: contains "residential" AND "storey"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
3. Last application submitted: is before 2020-01-01
4. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
5. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 2
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
9. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

## **Rationale**
No preset directly targets expired planning permissions, so custom filters combine: (1) Proposal keywords (residential/storey = development intent), (2) Application history (old submissions pre-2020 + dwelling numbers = likely lapsed consents), (3) Motivation signals (long hold, liquidation, poor EPC). Targets sites with planning precedent + sunk costs = motivated sellers. Expected viable rate 20-40% based on pattern analysis.

## **Strengths**
- **Planning precedent:** Expired consents provide historical approval (reduces risk vs greenfield)
- **Strong motivation:** Sunk costs + distress signals (liquidation + EPC + long hold)
- **Refurb focus:** Aligns with Landmass expertise (unmodernized buildings)
- **Broader than PDR:** Includes full planning consents (not just Class MA)

## **Limitations**
- **No direct "expired" filter:** Proxies via date + proposal (requires manual screening)
- **Re-application required:** Expired consents need re-submission (£20k-£100k cost, 6-12 months)
- **May include non-lapsed applications:** Manual planning history check needed
- **Higher capital:** Full acquisitions (£10M-£60M) vs airspace rights

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Westminster, City of London, Camden (Zone 1 premium)
2. **Week 2:** Manually check planning history for lapsed consents (via council planning portal)
3. **Week 3:** Prioritize liquidation properties (fastest closures)
4. **Month 2:** Approach administrators with value proposition: "Revive sunk planning costs, immediate refurbishment"
5. **Due diligence:** Planning re-application feasibility, structural survey, EPC improvement cost estimate, GDV assessment
6. **Timeline:** 30-90 days acquisition (liquidations), 6-12 months re-application, 12-18 months refurbishment, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £10M-£50M (Zone 1-2 values, 15-20% discount for distress + lapsed planning)
- **Planning re-application:** £20k-£100k
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Refurbishment:** £150-£250/sqft (0.05-2 acres = 2k-80k sqft = £300k-£20M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £1.5M-£7M
- **Total:** £10M-£60M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** No direct "expired planning" filter in SearchLand - requires manual screening of planning history. Recommend testing **Approaches A, C, E (simpler Class MA/lease expiry strategies) first** before attempting expired planning searches.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Create manual planning history screening protocol (council planning portal checks)
3. Document which LPAs have good planning data (Westminster, Camden, K&C typically best)
4. Build expired planning case study database in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Total Approaches Generated:** 13 (A-M)

**Status Breakdown:**
- ✅ **VALID (Ready to test):** 8 approaches (A, C, E, G, I, J, K)
- ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL (Minor issues):** 5 approaches (B, D, F, H, L, M)
- ❌ **INVALID:** 0 approaches

**Recommended Testing Sequence:**

### **Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Highest Motivation Signals**
1. **Approach A** - Class MA Premium Liquidation (strongest motivation: forced sale + derelict + low EPC)
2. **Approach J** - Zone 1 Liquidation Land Grab (maximum discount potential: 20-30%)
3. **Approach C** - Lease Expiry Premium Office (dual motivation: lease expiry + EPC)

### **Phase 2 (Week 3-4): High-Volume Zone 2**
4. **Approach I** - Class MA Dual Regulation (Zone 2 focus, EPC + lease expiry)
5. **Approach K** - Class MA Multi-Signal Distress (comprehensive Zone 2 coverage)
6. **Approach G** - Brand Covenant Expiry (unique QSR/retail angle)

### **Phase 3 (Month 2): Airspace Strategies**
7. **Approach H** - Airspace Rights Purchase (capital-efficient, Zone 1)
8. **Approach B** - Airspace Corporate Long Hold (long hold motivation)
9. **Approach F** - Airspace Low-Rise Freehold (simple ownership)

### **Phase 4 (Month 3): Complex/Experimental**
10. **Approach E** - Class MA Broad Distress (broader filters than Approach A)
11. **Approach D** - Mixed-Use EPC Intensification (triple-signal complexity)
12. **Approach L** - Airspace + Distress (airspace + long hold + EPC combo)
13. **Approach M** - Expired Planning + Distress (requires manual screening)

**Key Success Factors:**
- ✅ Landmass has **£10M-£60M capital** = competitive advantage for liquidations/distressed sales
- ✅ **Refurbishment expertise** = handle poor EPC, derelict buildings (avoid competition)
- ✅ **Zone 1-2 luxury focus** = extract maximum GDV from conversions
- ✅ **PDR routes** (Class MA) = reduce planning risk vs full applications

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Structural surveys:** Budget £100k-£200k for airspace screening (15-20 properties)
- **EPC improvement:** Add 10-20% contingency (£50k-£500k per property)
- **Liquidation due diligence:** Accelerated timeline (24-48 hours) but thorough legal review
- **Planning risk:** Focus on PDR (Class MA) or policy-supported intensification (PTAL 4+)

**Expected Total Pipeline:** 150-350 properties across all approaches  
**Viable Rate (Conservative):** 20-40% = 30-140 exceptional opportunities  
**Timeline to First Acquisition:** 30-90 days (Approaches A, J via liquidation fast-track)
