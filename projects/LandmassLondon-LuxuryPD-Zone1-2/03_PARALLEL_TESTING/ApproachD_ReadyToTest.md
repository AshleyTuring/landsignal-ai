# **APPROACH D: Mixed-Use EPC Intensification**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8C (EPC compliance pressure) + Airspace + Long hold (Pattern 2A)  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£45M  
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties (Zone 1-2)

```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i)]
3. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000 AND less than 80000
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
7. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
8. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
9. Ownership type: contains any [Company, Private owner]
10. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2015
11. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 2
12. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 60
```

## **Rationale**
Mixed-use (E + C3) provides existing permission precedent for both uses, easing intensification planning. EPC E-G creates MEES compliance pressure (cannot rent until improved - Pattern 8C). Flat roof + <15m height (3-5 storeys) = airspace potential (add 2-4 storeys). 10+ year hold signals tired landlord/trapped equity (Pattern 2A). <2 leaseholds = simple negotiation. 60%+ unconstrained plot = room for expansion.

## **Strengths**
- **Triple motivation:** Poor EPC + long hold + airspace potential
- **Existing mixed-use:** Planning precedent for intensification
- **Flat roof airspace:** Add 2-4 storeys luxury residential
- **MEES pressure:** Landlord cannot rent E-G rated properties (forced improvement or sale)
- **Lower competition:** Many developers avoid poor EPC complexity

## **Limitations**
- **EPC improvement costs:** £50k-£500k depending on building size
- **Mixed-use complexity:** Residential + commercial tenant management
- **Planning required:** Airspace not PDR for mixed-use (full planning application needed)
- **Structural survey critical:** Flat roof may not support additional storeys

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter across Zone 2 LPAs (Southwark, Islington, Hackney for volume)
2. **Week 2:** Target EPC F-G (strongest motivation) + flat roof + <12m height (3-4 storeys = most airspace potential)
3. **Month 2:** Approach with value proposition: "EPC compliance + refurbishment specialists, fast completion"
4. **Due diligence:** EPC improvement cost estimate, structural capacity assessment (airspace), GDV analysis
5. **Planning strategy:** Intensification (add 2-4 storeys) + refurbishment (EPC upgrade to B-C)
6. **Timeline:** 6-12 months acquisition, 18-30 months refurb + intensification, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £5M-£30M (mixed-use values, 10-15% discount for poor EPC + long hold)
- **EPC improvement:** £50k-£500k
- **Refurbishment:** £200-£300/sqft (5k-80k sqft = £1M-£24M)
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Contingency (10%):** £600k-£5.5M
- **Total:** £10M-£45M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Triple-signal approach (EPC + long hold + airspace) is complex. Recommend testing **Approach A or C first** (simpler motivation stacks) before attempting multi-signal strategies.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Add EPC improvement cost screening step (desktop analysis)
3. Prioritize properties with F-G ratings (strongest MEES pressure)
4. Document EPC improvement case studies in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
