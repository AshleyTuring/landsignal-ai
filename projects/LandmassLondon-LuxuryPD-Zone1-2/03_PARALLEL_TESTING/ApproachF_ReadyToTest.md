# **APPROACH F: Airspace Low-Rise Freehold**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Airspace mismatch) + Pattern 23A (Capital-efficient airspace)  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£40M  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 (skews to Zone 2; Zone 1 likely 8-15)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000
2. Sales listing price: is less than 40000000
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Max building height (m): is less than 12
5. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets freehold commercial blocks with flat-roof airspace (Preset #23) where existing massing <12m (3-4 storeys) is below tall-building policy thresholds, enabling 1-3 additional storeys. Unbroken title (<1 leasehold) removes leaseholder consent risk. Mid-size (2k+ sqft) keeps buildability and GDV balance. Price filter £5M-£40M aligns with Zone 1-2 freehold values.

## **Strengths**
- **Minimal assembly risk:** <1 leasehold = simple ownership
- **Structural uplift:** Leverage existing land value by adding floors
- **JV/optionable:** Lower capital entry via airspace rights purchase
- **Low-rise focus:** <12m height = policy headroom for intensification

## **Limitations**
- **Structural capacity unknown:** Roof load capacity requires survey (£10k-£30k per property)
- **Planning sensitivity:** Some LPAs sensitive to massing increases, even on low-rise
- **Freehold availability:** Limited pool of freehold commercial with <1 leasehold
- **Requires Preset #23:** Must apply "Airspace: Commercial, no resi" preset first

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Step 1:** Apply SearchLand Preset #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"
2. **Step 2:** Add filters above to preset results
3. **Week 1:** Prioritize 4-8 storey candidates (<12m height = 3-4 storeys existing)
4. **Week 2:** Focus on post-1970 concrete frames (better load capacity)
5. **Month 2:** Triage by PTAL/high streets for design acceptability
6. **Due diligence:** Structural desktop assessment, rights-to-light quick check, planning feasibility study
7. **Timeline:** 6-12 months negotiation + structural surveys, 18-24 months planning + construction, 24-36 months total ROI

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Freehold acquisition:** £5M-£40M
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£30k
- **Planning application:** £20k-£100k
- **Superstructure/fit-out:** £150-£250/sqft (1-3 storeys, 2k-20k sqft new = £300k-£5M)
- **Contingency (10%):** £550k-£4.5M
- **Total:** £5M-£40M

## **Next Steps**

**CONDITIONAL ISSUE:** Similar to Approach B - structural survey budget must be clarified upfront (£10k-£30k per property). Recommend allocating £100k-£200k survey budget for screening 10-20 properties.

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Apply SearchLand Preset #23 first
2. Copy filters above as refinements
3. Add structural survey screening step to workflow
4. Document survey findings (load capacity, frame type) in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
