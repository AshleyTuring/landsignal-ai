### Approach A: Class MA Distressed Commercial Conversion
**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"  
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Motivation + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (PDR conversion to residential)  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£20M (Zone 2 focus: acquisition £5M-£15M, conversion £1M-£3M, total £6M-£18M)  
**Expected Results:** 20-60 properties (Zone 2 broader search, refined for motivation reduces to viable distressed assets)

2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 1
3. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset targets Class MA eligible commercial buildings (E use classes, built-up areas, size constraints). Refinements add scale (0.05-1 acres for manageable Zone 2 sites), motivation signals (liquidation/administration for forced sales, poor EPC for regulatory pressure, expiring leases for income cliff), and constraints exclusion (avoids planning blockers). This creates a focused search for distressed commercial assets ripe for PDR conversion to luxury residential. Expected viable rate 30-50% based on preset performance and refinement patterns from case studies (e.g., v22 mixed-use refinements improved from 17% to 100% viable).

**Strengths:**
- PDR reduces planning risk and timeline (56 days vs 8-12 months)
- Strong motivation signals create 20-30% discount potential
- Zone 2 focus aligns with £5M-£20M budget for 20-60 unit conversions
- Preset is pre-validated for Class MA eligibility

**Limitations:**
- Requires prior approval process (not automatic)
- Size limits (100-8,000 sqmt) may exclude some large opportunities
- Liquidation properties may have complex legal issues
- EPC E-G properties need £50k-£500k upgrades before rental

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Apply LPA filters manually (Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney, Wandsworth, Lambeth). Run search, export results, screen for strong motivation (liquidation status, poor EPC, lease expiry). Prioritize sites with flat roofs for airspace upside. Approach administrators directly for quick closures. Budget for prior approval costs (£5k-£15k) and EPC improvements.

### Approach B: Airspace Development on Distressed Commercial
**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation + Scale + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (airspace intensification)  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£40M (Zone 1-2: airspace rights £2M-£10M, build costs £5M-£20M, total £7M-£30M)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (commercial focus narrows results, motivation filters target distressed sellers)

2. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
3. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
4. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 2
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset targets commercial buildings with flat roofs and no residential use (ideal for airspace). Refinements add motivation (long institutional holds for trapped equity, poor EPC for compliance pressure), scale (0.1-2 acres for viable intensification), and constraints exclusion (avoids planning issues). This exploits information arbitrage on distressed commercial assets with airspace potential, creating margin through additional floors. Expected viable rate 40-60% based on preset targeting and refinement patterns (e.g., adding motivation filters in v22 case studies improved viability).

**Strengths:**
- Flat roof requirement ensures airspace feasibility
- Long hold + poor EPC signals strong seller motivation (10-20% discount)
- Lower upfront capital than full building purchase (airspace rights focus)
- Preset excludes residential, focusing on pure commercial opportunities

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural surveys (£5k-£15k) to confirm capacity
- Freeholder negotiation needed for airspace rights
- Planning still required for additional floors (not PDR)
- Institutional long holds may have complex ownership

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Apply LPA filters manually (Westminster, City of London, Camden, Tower Hamlets, Southwark). Run search, prioritize sites with 5-12m height for 2-4 additional storeys. Use long hold signal for direct owner outreach (off-market). Secure airspace options (£50k-£200k deposits) while obtaining planning. Leverage luxury refurb expertise for high-end residential conversion.

### Approach C: Expired Planning Permission Refurb Opportunities
**Base Preset:** Custom filters (no preset fits - presets focus on PDR/eligible sites, not expired consents)  
**Refinements Applied:** N/A (custom filters)  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (revive lapsed consents)  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£60M (Zone 1-2: acquisition £10M-£50M, refurb £3M-£10M, total £13M-£60M)  
**Expected Results:** 5-20 properties (expired planning is rare, motivation filters narrow to distressed sellers)  

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "residential" AND "storey"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
3. Last application submitted: is before 2020-01-01
4. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
5. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 2
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
9. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C2 - Residential institutions, C4 - HMO]
```

**Rationale:**  
No preset directly targets expired planning permissions, so custom filters combine proposal keywords (residential/storey for development intent), application history (old submissions + dwelling numbers for lapsed consents), and motivation signals (long holds, liquidation, poor EPC). This capitalizes on sunk planning costs creating motivated sellers. Expected viable rate 20-40% based on pattern analysis (stale planning + motivation signals from v22 case studies).

**Strengths:**
- Targets sites with planning precedent (reduces risk vs greenfield)
- Strong motivation from sunk costs + distress signals
- Refurb focus aligns with Landmass expertise
- Broader than PDR (includes full planning consents)

**Limitations:**
- Expired consents require re-application (time/cost)
- No direct "expired" filter (proxy via date + proposal)
- May include non-lapsed applications (manual screening needed)
- Higher capital for full acquisitions

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Apply LPA filters manually (Westminster, City of London, Camden for Zone 1 premium). Run search, manually check planning history for lapsed consents. Prioritize liquidation properties for fast closures. Budget for planning re-application (£20k-£100k) and refurbishment. Use distressed signals for negotiation leverage.
