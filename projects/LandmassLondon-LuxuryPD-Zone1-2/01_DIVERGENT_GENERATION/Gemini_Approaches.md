### Approach A: The Zone 1 Airspace Arbitrage

**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Development Potential + Ownership Complexity + Constraints
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Capital-efficient airspace acquisition)
**Capital Required:** £2M - £10M (for airspace rights, not the entire asset)
**Expected Results:** 5-15 (highly targeted)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes]
3. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO, C2 - Residential institutions, C1 - Hotels]
4. Developed area (sqft): is greater than 3229
5. Developed area percentage: is less than or equal to 30
6. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to true
7. Max building height on title (m): is less than 25
8. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
9. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
10. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND is less than 60000000
11. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Listed Building(s) in plot, Conservation Area]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets one of Landmass's key PD strategies—airspace development—in the highest value location, Zone 1. Instead of acquiring the entire £10M-£60M building, this strategy aims to identify buildings where Landmass can purchase just the airspace rights for a fraction of the cost, aligning with a more capital-efficient entry.

The base preset (#23) provides a starting point of commercial buildings with flat roofs. The refinements surgically narrow the results:
- **Potential:** `Max building height on title (m): is less than 25` specifically targets low-to-mid-rise buildings with significant vertical extension potential.
- **Complexity:** `Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3` is critical for simplifying the acquisition of airspace rights, avoiding protracted negotiations with multiple tenants.
- **Constraints:** Excluding `Conservation Area` and `Listed Building(s) in plot` is vital for an airspace strategy, as these designations make adding height exceptionally difficult.

**Strengths:**
- **Capital Efficient:** Lower capital entry into the prime Zone 1 market by acquiring rights, not the whole asset.
- **High Value Creation:** Adding luxury flats in Zone 1 at £2,000-£4,000 psf on top of an existing structure creates substantial margin.
- **Targeted:** Directly addresses a core client requirement (airspace PD).

**Limitations:**
- **Lower Deal Flow:** The combination of flat roofs, low height, and simple ownership in Zone 1 is rare.
- **Negotiation Complexity:** Acquiring airspace rights can be complex, even with few leaseholders.
- **Structural Risk:** The existing building must be able to support additional floors, requiring due diligence.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Execute this search within Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea. The primary goal is to identify buildings, then approach the freeholder off-market to negotiate the purchase of the airspace rights, leveraging the PD potential as the value proposition.

### Approach B: The Class MA 'Regulatory Squeeze'

**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (Dual Signal) + Capital + Scale + Ownership
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Regulation-driven conversion)
**Capital Required:** £5M - £20M (for Zone 2 asset acquisition)
**Expected Results:** 20-40

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(c)(i) - Financial constants, E(c)(ii) - Professional constants, E(c)(iii) - Other commercial constants, E(d) - Indoor sport, E(e) - Provision of medical or health constants, E(f) - Creche, day nursery or day centre, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
3. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND is less than 40000
5. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
6. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
7. Ownership type: is one of [Corporate, Company]
8. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 20000000
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy creates a "perfect storm" of motivation for Class MA conversions in Zone 2. It starts with the correct asset type (Preset #32) and then applies a dual-pronged regulatory pressure filter.

1.  **EPC Pressure:** An `EPC rating` of E, F, or G means the landlord cannot legally let the property without spending significant capital on upgrades (MEES regulations).
2.  **Income Cliff:** A `Lease end date` before 2027 means any remaining rental income is about to cease, creating a void period and associated costs.

Faced with a non-lettable, soon-to-be-vacant asset, a corporate owner is highly motivated to sell to a developer like Landmass who can bypass these issues via a Class MA residential conversion. The refinements focus on corporate sellers who are more likely to make a rational financial decision to divest a non-performing asset.

**Strengths:**
- **Strong Motivation:** Combines two powerful, regulation-driven motivation signals, increasing the likelihood of securing a discount.
- **High Volume:** This combination of factors is common in aging Zone 2 commercial stock, likely yielding a good number of opportunities.
- **Directly Actionable:** Every property found is, by definition, a candidate for Landmass's primary business model: Class MA conversion.

**Limitations:**
- **Competition:** Other developers will be aware of these regulatory pressures.
- **Refurbishment Costs:** Poor EPC ratings imply substantial refurbishment will be needed, which must be factored into the financial model.
- **Lease Complexity:** Existing leases, even if expiring, require management and potential surrender negotiations.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Run this search across priority Zone 2 LPAs (Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington, Hackney). Screen the results for the properties with the earliest lease expiry dates and lowest EPC ratings, as they will have the highest seller motivation.

### Approach C: The Zone 1 Liquidation Land Grab

**Base Preset:** "Custom filters (no preset fits)"
**Refinements Applied:** N/A (custom filters)
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Distressed asset acquisition)
**Capital Required:** £10M - £60M (Off-Market asset acquisition)
**Expected Results:** 2-10 (very rare but extremely high value)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions]
4. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
5. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
6. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 20000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI]
```

**Rationale:**
This is a highly aggressive, off-market strategy designed to find deeply discounted assets by targeting the ultimate seller motivation: forced sale by administrators. There is no preset for this, requiring a custom approach.

By filtering for `Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]`, we bypass all other market noise and go directly to situations where a seller (the administrator) has a legal duty to dispose of assets, often quickly and at a discount to achieve certainty of sale. This creates the 20-30% discount margin that makes deals in the prime Zone 1 market exceptionally profitable.

This search intentionally omits a `Sales listing price` filter because these deals are frequently conducted off-market with a small pool of credible, well-funded buyers. The strategy targets large, prime commercial buildings (`Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 20000`) that are perfect canvases for Landmass's luxury conversion expertise.

**Strengths:**
- **Maximum Discount Potential:** Targets forced sales, where the largest discounts (20%+) are typically found.
- **Reduced Competition:** Often conducted off-market, avoiding bidding wars.
- **Speed of Execution:** Administrators are motivated to transact quickly and cleanly, which suits a well-capitalized buyer like Landmass.
- **Creates Margin:** The acquisition discount is the primary driver of the 20%+ profit margin the client seeks.

**Limitations:**
- **Extremely Low Deal Flow:** Corporate liquidations involving prime £20M+ freehold assets are rare.
- **High Risk:** Properties may have hidden legal or structural issues. Due diligence must be rapid and thorough.
- **Requires Strong Capital Position:** To be credible to an administrator, a buyer must be able to demonstrate cash funds and the ability to close without financing clauses.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Run this search across Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, K&C, City of London) on a recurring basis (e.g., weekly) to catch new opportunities the moment they arise. This is a time-sensitive, opportunistic play that relies on being the first credible buyer to the table.
