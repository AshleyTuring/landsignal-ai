## 🎯 Investment Criteria

**Also consider:** Properties with planning permission (if expired or requiring refurbishment)

## 📊 Profit Margin Target

**Client Statement:** "Interested in anything that yields 20%+ in their price range"

**Reality Check:**
- Zone 1-2 luxury market often operates at 15-18% margins

- Focus on distressed/unmodernized assets = margin creation opportunity

**Minimum Required:** 15% (to account for market reality)  
**Target:** 20%+  
**Exceptional:** 25%+

---

## 🔍 Property Characteristics: "Distressed/Unmodernized"

### What Landmass Means by This:

**1. Physical Distress:**
- Buildings needing substantial refurbishment
- Poor EPC ratings (E, F, G) = regulatory pressure
- Dated 1970s-1990s office/commercial buildings
- Vacancy or long-term under-utilization

**2. Ownership Distress:**
- Corporate liquidations (forced sales)
- Institutional non-core assets (long holds, divesting)
- Expired planning permissions (sunk costs, tired sellers)
- Lease expiry situations (income cliff edge)

**3. Operational Issues:**
- Poor management (high vacancy)
- Deferred maintenance
- MEES compliance failures (cannot rent until upgraded)
- Single tenant risk (lease ending, no replacement)

---

## 🏗️ Target Property Types

### Primary: Commercial Buildings (for Class MA PD)

**Use Classes:**
- E - Commercial/Business/Service (offices, retail)
- E(g)(i) - Offices

**Building Types:**
- Mid-rise office blocks (5-12 floors)
- Retail/commercial ground floor with offices above
- Former institutional buildings (banks, government)
- Mixed-use commercial

- Freehold or long leasehold control
- Current use: Commercial or mixed-use (not pure residential)
- Location: High-value areas (Zone 1-2)

**Capital Structure:**

---

### Tertiary: Planning Permission Sites

**Only if:**
- Planning permission granted (even if expired)
- Substantial refurbishment required
- Distressed seller situation (liquidation, long hold)
- Luxury residential approved or likely

---

## 🚩 Seller Motivation Signals (CRITICAL)

**Why Motivation Matters:**
- £10M-£60M deals require STRONG seller motivation
- Distressed situations = 15-30% discount vs market value
- Creates the margin that makes deals viable

### Top Motivation Signals:

**1. Corporate Liquidation/Administration**
- Filter: `Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]`
- Seller: Administrator (legal forced sale)
- Discount: 20-30% below market
- Timeline: Fast (30-90 days)

**2. Poor EPC + MEES Regulations**
- Filter: `EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]`
- Issue: Cannot rent until upgraded (£50k-£500k+ costs)
- Seller motivation: Exit vs expensive upgrade
- Discount: 10-20% below market

**3. Lease Expiry (Income Cliff)**
- Filter: `Lease end date: is before [date]`
- Issue: Rental income stops, void property costs
- Seller motivation: Sell now (tenanted) vs face vacancy
- Discount: 10-20% below market

**4. Long-Term Institutional Holds**
- Filter: `Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01` (10+ years)
- Ownership: Institutional, corporate (non-core asset)
- Seller motivation: Portfolio rationalization, trapped equity
- Discount: 5-15% below market (less urgent than liquidation)

**5. Expired Planning Permission**
- Filter: Check planning history, look for lapsed consents
- Issue: Sunk costs, planning re-application required
- Seller motivation: Exit vs re-invest in planning
- Discount: 10-25% (depending on viability)

## 📋 Success Criteria for Generated Approaches

**Each approach MUST:**
1. ✅ Start with a SearchLand preset (not 15 custom filters)
2. ✅ Add 2-5 refinement filters (motivation + geography + size)
3. ✅ Target £5M-£60M price range (or explain off-market strategy)
4. ✅ Include at least ONE seller motivation signal
5. ✅ Focus on Zone 1-2 LPAs
6. ✅ Explain the profit mechanism (acquisition → refurb → luxury sale)
7. ✅ Calculate estimated margin (aim for 20%+)

**Approaches should be DIVERSE:**
- Different presets (Class MA vs Airspace vs Mixed-Use)
- Different motivation signals (Liquidation vs EPC vs Lease Expiry)
- Different price points (£5M-£20M vs £20M-£60M)
- Different geographies (Zone 1 vs Zone 2)

---

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

**Realistic Result Counts:**
- Zone 1 (Westminster, City): 5-20 properties per approach
- Zone 2 (broader): 20-60 properties per approach
- Total across all approaches: 50-150 properties to screen

**Quality over Quantity:**
- Better to find 10 exceptional opportunities
- Than 100 mediocre ones
- Focus on STRONG seller motivation signals

---

## 📊 Example Financial Model (Zone 2 Target)

**Acquisition:**
- Purchase price: £12M (£15M value, 20% liquidation discount)
- Stamp duty + legal: £600k
- **Total acquisition: £12.6M**

**Development:**
- Refurbishment: £3M (luxury spec, £150/sqft on 20,000 sqft)
- Building control, fees: £200k
- **Total development: £3.2M**

**Total Investment: £15.8M**

**Exit:**
- 20 luxury flats × 1,000 sqft each = 20,000 sqft
- Sales value: £1,500/sqft (Zone 2 premium)
- Total GDV: 20 × (1,000 sqft × £1,500) = £30M
- Sales costs: £300k (1%)
- **Net proceeds: £29.7M**

**Profit: £29.7M - £15.8M = £13.9M**

**Margin: 13.9M / 15.8M = 88% ROI or 47% of GDV**

*Note: This is illustrative - actual margins may be 20-30% depending on deal specifics*
