## Approach A: The Precedent-Proxy Airspace Play

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) and Pattern 6A (Airspace Development).
**Capital Required:** £155,000
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties per major city.

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
2. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 9 AND less than 21
3. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
5. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, other than hot food", "E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions", "B2 - General industrial"
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
7. Ownership type: is one of "Company", "Private owner"
8. Sales listing currently on the market: No
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets the precedent of an 8-storey mixed-use scheme by identifying sites with the physical and locational characteristics to support such a development. Since a "Tall Building Zone" filter doesn't exist, it uses "Distance to nearest Train Station < 800m" as a robust proxy for areas where local authorities support density (as per `LEARNINGS_DATABASE`).

It focuses on airspace development, which is a highly capital-efficient strategy fitting the £200k budget. By targeting existing 3-6 storey commercial buildings (9-21m height) with flat roofs, we find structures that can likely support additional floors. Filtering for commercial use classes (E, B2) provides a base for a mixed-use scheme (Class E ground floor + C3 residential above).

The motivation angle is crucial for an off-market, low-capital deal. By filtering for `< 2 applications in 5 years` and `Sales listing currently on the market: No`, we target passive owners who are not actively developing their sites, making them more receptive to an option agreement to purchase airspace rights.

**Strengths:**
-   Capital-efficient, using the £200k for airspace rights, not a full site purchase.
-   Directly mimics the characteristics of the successful planning precedent (density near transport).
-   Targets passive, off-market owners, increasing the likelihood of a favourable option agreement.
-   Filters are robust and available UK-wide (avoids London-only PTAL).
-   The commercial base provides potential for existing income or a clear Class E component for the mixed-use scheme.

**Limitations:**
-   Structural integrity of the existing building is unknown and requires a survey.
-   Assumes the freeholder is willing to sell the airspace.
-   Does not guarantee the local authority has a specific tall building policy for that exact site.
-   Competition from other airspace developers may exist.
-   Requires sophisticated negotiation and legal structuring for the airspace rights.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Execute Search:** Run the filter across target geographies (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester).
2.  **Desktop Analysis:** For each result, conduct a high-level review of the building's age, condition (via Google Street View), and surrounding context to shortlist the top 10-15 candidates.
3.  **Ownership & Approach:** Identify the ultimate beneficial owner. Initiate a direct, professional approach with a clear proposal to acquire the airspace rights via an option agreement, contingent on planning permission.
4.  **Negotiate Option:** Secure a 24-month option agreement.
5.  **Due Diligence:** Conduct a full structural survey to confirm the building can take the additional load.
6.  **Planning Application:** Submit a full planning application for a mixed-use scheme of up to 8 storeys total height.
7.  **Exit:** Upon grant of planning, either exercise the option and develop the scheme, or sell the site with the benefit of the planning permission and the option agreement to a larger developer for a profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
-   Option Fee (for 24-month exclusivity on airspace): £50,000
-   Legal Fees (for option agreement): £15,000
-   Initial Architectural Feasibility & Massing Studies: £15,000
-   Structural Engineer's Initial Survey: £10,000
-   Planning Application Costs (incl. consultant fees, reports): £65,000
-   **Total:** £155,000

## Approach B: The Motivated Seller's Stalled Project

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 1A (Old Planning + No Recent Activity) and Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales).
**Capital Required:** £115,000
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties UK-wide.

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of "Liquidation", "In Administration"
3. Last application submitted: is before 2021-01-01
4. Proposal: contains "storey" AND "residential"
5. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 10
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 3
7. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy focused on a powerful combination of motivation signals. It targets sites where significant planning work has already been done for a multi-storey residential scheme, but the project has stalled, and the owner is now in financial distress.

The `Company status: is one of "Liquidation", "In Administration"` filter is a critical motivation signal from the `LEARNINGS_DATABASE`, indicating a forced sale. The liquidator has a legal duty to sell assets and will prioritize speed and certainty over maximizing price.

Combining this with `Last application submitted: is before 2021-01-01` and `Proposal: contains "storey" AND "residential"` identifies stalled projects of the correct type and scale. The groundwork and planning precedent are already there, but the value has not been realized. This creates an opportunity to acquire the site at a significant discount, making the £200k capital outlay viable for a direct purchase or a highly advantageous option.

**Strengths:**
-   Targets sellers under extreme pressure to sell quickly, creating immense negotiating leverage.
-   Acquires sites where planning precedent for a multi-storey development has already been established.
-   Potential to acquire the asset significantly below market value, directly contributing to the £2M profit target.
-   A very narrow and targeted search, leading to high-quality, actionable leads.
-   The liquidator is a clear, legally mandated decision-maker, simplifying negotiations.

**Limitations:**
-   The pool of properties is extremely small; results may be geographically scattered.
-   Properties may have legal complications or debts attached that need to be resolved.
-   The original planning may have been refused or may have issues that need to be overcome.
-   Competition from other distressed asset funds may be fierce.
-   Requires the ability to transact quickly, often with cash or pre-arranged financing.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Execute Search:** Run the filter UK-wide to maximize the chance of finding a match.
2.  **Rapid Due Diligence:** Immediately investigate the planning history and the reason for the company's failure. Assess if the planning concept is still viable.
3.  **Contact Liquidator:** Make immediate contact with the appointed liquidator/administrator. Present a clean, straightforward offer with proof of funds.
4.  **Structure Deal:** Propose either a discounted purchase using bridging finance or an option agreement with a non-refundable deposit to provide the liquidator with immediate cash and certainty.
5.  **Acquire & Reposition:** Once control is secured, update the previous planning application, address any historical issues, and resubmit.
6.  **Exit:** With a fresh planning consent, sell the de-risked site to a mainstream developer for a significant uplift, or develop it out.

**Capital Breakdown:**
-   Option Fee / Deposit to Liquidator: £75,000
-   Legal Fees (for complex acquisition/option): £20,000
-   Planning & Viability Assessment: £20,000
-   **Total:** £115,000

## Approach C: The Commercial-to-Resi Intensification

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + High Accessibility) combined with Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities).
**Capital Required:** £180,000
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties per major city.

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Use class: is one of "E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions", "E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, other than hot food"
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Lease end date: is between 2025-11-20 and 2027-05-20
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. Sales listing currently on the market: No
7. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is greater than 10
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets under-developed commercial properties in prime locations that are ripe for intensification. It blends a clear development rationale (intensification) with a powerful motivation signal (lease expiry).

The strategy focuses on low-rise commercial buildings (`Max building height on title (m): is less than 15`) near transport hubs, which are ideal candidates for adding significant residential density above. This aligns with the precedent of an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.

The key is the `Lease end date` filter. A lease expiring within the next 6-18 months creates a "motivation window." The landlord faces an income cliff and must decide whether to re-let the commercial space or sell. This is the perfect moment to propose an option agreement for a mixed-use redevelopment, offering the landlord a potentially higher-value exit than re-letting. By targeting off-market properties, we avoid competition and inflated prices.

**Strengths:**
-   Targets landlords at a predictable point of motivation (lease expiry).
-   The existing commercial building can be retained on the ground floor, perfectly matching the mixed-use precedent.
-   Focuses on high-value locations (near train stations) where residential density is supported.
-   Capital-efficient option-based approach.
-   Avoids conservation areas to reduce planning complexity.

**Limitations:**
-   The landlord may successfully find a new commercial tenant, removing the motivation.
-   The existing building's structure may not be suitable for adding multiple storeys.
-   Change of use planning permission will be required for the upper floors.
-   The landlord may have unrealistic price expectations for a redevelopment scheme.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Execute Search:** Run the filter in target urban areas.
2.  **Prioritize:** Shortlist properties where the existing commercial tenant is likely to leave (e.g., struggling retail sector, outdated office blocks).
3.  **Landlord Approach:** Contact the landlord 6-9 months before the lease expires. Frame the proposal as an alternative to the risk and cost of finding a new tenant and managing a potential void period.
4.  **Negotiate Option:** Structure an option agreement to purchase the entire site, conditional on planning for a mixed-use scheme.
5.  **Planning & Design:** Engage architects to design a scheme that retains the ground-floor commercial use while adding 5-7 storeys of residential above.
6.  **Submit Application:** File a full planning application.
7.  **Exit:** Once planning is granted, exercise the option and either develop the project or sell the consented site to a housebuilder.

**Capital Breakdown:**
-   Option Fee: £70,000
-   Legal Fees: £15,000
-   Architectural & Planning Consultant Fees: £80,000
-   Structural & Site Surveys: £15,000
-   **Total:** £180,000
