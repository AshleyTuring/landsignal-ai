Here are three targeted property search strategies to fit a mixed-use, eight-storey, ~2 M sq ft project:

- **Transit-Centric Assemblage** – Map parcels within a 5–7 minute walk of high-capacity transit hubs, prioritize underutilized commercial/industrial plots already zoned (or rezoning-friendly) for higher FAR, and negotiate multi-lot assemblages to hit the total footprint while leveraging TOD incentives and reduced parking ratios.  
- **Adaptive-Reuse Spine** – Scan aging office or retail corridors where vacancy is high but infrastructure capacity (power, sewer, fiber) is strong; target buildings suitable for partial retention of podium levels and vertical additions to reach eight storeys, lowering structural costs and accelerating approvals by emphasizing sustainability benefits.  
- **Civic Partnership Catalyst** – Approach municipalities with redevelopment mandates (e.g., downtown revitalization districts) and offer public-private partnerships on city-owned land: combine market-rate housing, affordable units, and civic amenities; exchange programmatic commitments for expedited entitlements, tax abatements, and discounted land pricing to meet the 2 M sq ft requirement.
