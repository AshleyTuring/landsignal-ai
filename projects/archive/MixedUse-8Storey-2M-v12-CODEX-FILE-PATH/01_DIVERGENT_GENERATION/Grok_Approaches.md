## Approach A: Precedent-Based 8-Storey Mixed-Use Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A: Similar planning approvals (8-storey mixed-use)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreements for planning-contingent deals)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "8-storey" AND "mixed-use"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
7. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3
8. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with existing 8-storey mixed-use planning approvals similar to the Slough/Birmingham/Manchester precedent, focusing on substantial height (25-35m), multi-unit residential above flexible retail ground floors. By replicating successful precedents, we reduce planning risk while leveraging the £200k capital constraint through option agreements rather than direct purchase.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching reduces planning uncertainty
- Focuses on transport-accessible urban areas supporting density
- Targets sites with established use classes compatible with mixed-use
- Low upfront capital via options allows multiple site testing

**Limitations:**
- Limited to sites with recent approvals (may be priced at post-planning value)
- Requires manual verification of amenity provisions (terraces, parking)
- Competition from housebuilders may increase acquisition costs
- Geographic focus may miss emerging areas

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify approved 8-storey mixed-use sites
2. Cross-reference with local planning portals for full approval details
3. Secure option agreements (£10k-£50k) on 3-5 sites with planning-contingent terms
4. Engage planning consultants to assess resubmission potential if approvals are expiring
5. Negotiate direct with freehold owners, targeting corporate holdings for faster decisions
6. Structure deals with overage provisions to capture upside from development

## Approach B: Airspace Intensification in Tall Building Zones

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, height headroom)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (airspace rights purchase + minimal build costs within budget)  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15 AND less than 25
3. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
7. Ownership type: is equal to Company
8. Latest sold date: is before 2019-01-01
9. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3
10. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot
```

**Rationale:**
This capital-efficient approach targets existing commercial buildings in London's tall building zones with flat roofs and height capacity for adding 4-6 storeys of residential above, creating 8-storey mixed-use developments. The £200k budget supports airspace rights acquisition rather than full site purchase, with corporate ownership providing motivated sellers for quick negotiations.

**Strengths:**
- Utilizes existing infrastructure and utilities, reducing development costs
- London PTAL focus ensures transport accessibility for density
- Corporate ownership signals potential motivation for asset monetization
- Flat roofs enable straightforward residential extensions

**Limitations:**
- Limited to London (PTAL filter geography constraint)
- Requires structural engineering assessment (additional £5k-£15k cost)
- Freeholder negotiation complexity for airspace rights
- May face local opposition in established commercial areas

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for flat-roof commercial buildings in PTAL 4-6b areas
2. Conduct desktop structural reviews using existing building data
3. Approach corporate freeholders with airspace development proposals
4. Secure airspace rights agreements (£20k-£100k) with profit-sharing terms
5. Partner with residential developers for joint venture execution
6. Phase development to stay within capital constraints, focusing on planning gain

## Approach C: Regulation-Driven Stalled Planning Revival

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A: Old planning + No recent activity  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£200k (direct purchase of distressed assets)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Last application submitted: is before 2020-01-01
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 15
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 2.5
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
8. Ownership type: is equal to Company
9. Company status: is one of Liquidation
10. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3
11. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot
```

**Rationale:**
This approach exploits regulatory motivation from companies in liquidation, targeting sites with old mixed-use planning applications that stalled due to owner circumstances. The forced sale scenario allows acquisition below market value, with existing planning providing a foundation for 8-storey redevelopment within the £200k capital limit.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation from liquidation status (forced asset sales)
- Existing planning derisks development timeline
- Corporate liquidation provides clear decision-making
- Combines precedent analysis with distressed pricing

**Limitations:**
- Liquidation properties may have complex legal encumbrances
- Requires due diligence on planning expiry status
- Limited geographic availability of liquidation cases
- May need professional insolvency expertise

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Monitor for liquidation signals in company status filters
2. Verify planning application details and expiry status
3. Engage insolvency practitioners for direct negotiations
4. Structure conditional contracts contingent on planning validity
5. Conduct environmental assessments for brownfield considerations
6. Execute quick completions to capitalize on distressed pricing before asset distribution
