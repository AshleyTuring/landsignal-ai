## Approach A: Precedent-Based 8-Storey Mixed-Use Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A: Similar planning approvals (8-storey mixed-use)

**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreements £10k-£50k, planning consultancy £20k-£50k, legal due diligence £20k-£50k)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (narrow focus on recent approvals)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "8-storey" AND "mixed-use"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
7. NOT: Flood zone 3
8. NOT: Conservation area
9. NOT: Listed building(s) in plot
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with recent planning approvals for similar 8-storey mixed-use developments (flexible retail ground floor with residential above), replicating the successful Slough/Birmingham/Manchester precedents. By focusing on approved schemes within the last 5 years, we identify proven development patterns with policy support for tall buildings and densification. The filters capture the key characteristics: substantial height (25-35m implied by 8 storeys), multi-unit residential (>20 dwellings), transport accessibility (<800m train), and compatible use classes (E commercial transitioning to residential). This precedent-based strategy derisks planning by demonstrating similar developments have been approved nearby.

**Strengths:**
- Planning derisked through precedent analysis
- Clear development template from approved schemes
- Policy support for tall buildings in urban areas
- Transport accessibility supports density requirements
- Narrow results focus on high-probability matches

**Limitations:**
- Limited to areas with recent 8-storey approvals (may miss emerging markets)
- Requires manual review of planning documents for exact scheme details
- Competition from other developers following same precedents
- May exclude sites with expired planning but resubmittable applications
- Geographic bias toward areas with tall building policies

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 10-30 sites with recent 8-storey mixed-use approvals
2. Manually review planning applications to confirm scheme details (retail ground + residential above, communal amenities)
3. Secure option agreements (£10k-£50k) with landowners for 12-24 month exclusivity
4. Engage planning consultant (£20k-£50k) to adapt precedent scheme to target site
5. Conduct legal due diligence (£20k-£50k) on title and planning conditions
6. Submit planning application using precedent evidence
7. Exit via sale to housebuilder or joint venture upon approval

## Approach B: Capital-Efficient Option Agreement Pipeline

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4B: Option agreement candidates

**Capital Required:** £30k-£120k (option deposits £10k-£50k, initial legal £10k-£30k, planning scoping £10k-£40k)

**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (broader pipeline for option farming)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Latest sold date: No latest sold date
2. Ownership type: is one of Private owner, Company
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
6. Freehold tenure
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. NOT: Flood zone 3
10. NOT: Conservation area
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets legacy holdings (never sold, indicating inherited or long-term family ownership) with inactive buildings and minimal recent planning activity, ideal for low-capital option agreements within the £200k budget. By focusing on sites with appropriate size (0.5-5 acres for 8-storey development), transport proximity (<1km train), and freehold tenure, we identify motivated sellers unaware of development potential. The inactive building filter suggests stalled or underutilized assets, while the "no latest sold date" captures legacy holdings where owners may be open to creative structures like options. This capital-efficient strategy allows securing multiple sites with minimal upfront commitment, creating a pipeline for planning applications contingent on option exercise.

**Strengths:**
- Very low initial capital (£10k-£50k per option) fits £200k budget
- Targets motivated legacy owners (inherited holdings, unaware value)
- Off-market approach avoids competition from active listings
- Flexible pipeline strategy (secure multiple options, pursue best)
- Freehold tenure simplifies development structure

**Limitations:**
- Requires strong negotiation skills for option agreements
- Owners may reject option terms (need planning contingency)
- Inactive buildings may have hidden condition issues
- Broader results require manual filtering for 8-storey suitability
- Time-intensive relationship building with private owners

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 20-50 legacy holdings with inactive buildings
2. Research ownership via Land Registry to identify private/family companies
3. Approach owners with option proposal (£10k-£50k deposit, 12-24 month term, planning-contingent)
4. Secure initial legal agreements (£10k-£30k) for option exclusivity
5. Conduct planning scoping (£10k-£40k) to assess 8-storey mixed-use feasibility
6. Exercise options on most promising sites (convert to full acquisition)
7. Develop planning applications using mixed-use template
8. Exit via sale to developer or joint venture upon planning approval

## Approach C: Airspace Intensification in Urban Transport Hubs

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, height headroom)

**Capital Required:** £80k-£180k (airspace rights negotiation £20k-£80k, structural assessment £10k-£30k, planning application £30k-£50k, legal £20k-£30k)

**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (urban focus with transport priority)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 3
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
6. Ownership type: is one of Private owner, Company
7. NOT: Flood zone 3
8. NOT: Conservation area
9. NOT: Listed building(s) in plot
10. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets existing buildings with flat roofs and height headroom (<15m current vs. 25-35m potential for 8 storeys) in high-transport-accessibility urban areas, enabling airspace development for mixed-use intensification. By focusing on commercial use classes (E) suitable for retail ground floors and transport proximity (<500m train station), we identify sites where adding residential storeys above creates substantial value. The flat roof filter ensures structural feasibility for extensions, while excluding green belt and conservation constraints maintains planning viability. This airspace strategy leverages existing infrastructure (utilities, access) while meeting the 8-storey height requirements through permitted development rights or planning approvals.

**Strengths:**
- Utilizes existing buildings and infrastructure (lower development costs)
- Flat roofs enable straightforward airspace extensions
- Transport proximity supports high-density residential above retail
- Commercial ground floor provides income during development
- Height headroom allows 4-6 additional storeys for 8-storey total

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural assessments to confirm load-bearing capacity
- Freeholder negotiation may be complex for airspace rights
- Urban focus may increase acquisition costs
- Planning approval needed for height increases beyond PDR limits
- Limited to buildings with actual flat roofs (not pitched/converted)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 15-40 urban sites with flat roofs and height potential
2. Conduct structural assessments (£10k-£30k) to confirm airspace capacity for 4-6 additional storeys
3. Negotiate airspace rights with freeholders (£20k-£80k) for development exclusivity
4. Engage planning consultant (£30k-£50k) for mixed-use intensification application
5. Secure legal agreements (£20k-£30k) for airspace development rights
6. Submit planning application for 8-storey mixed-use (retail ground + residential above)
7. Execute development or exit via sale to housebuilder with planning consent
