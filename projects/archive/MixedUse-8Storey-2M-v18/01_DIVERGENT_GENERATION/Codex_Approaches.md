### Approach A: Tall Podium Replication
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5 – High-Density/Intensification  
**Capital Required:** £120k option premiums + £50k planning/design + £30k surveys/contingency ≈ £200k (structured through option/JV rather than purchase)  
**Expected Results:** 45-65 titles nationwide in PTAL-rich urban cores

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.20 AND less than 1.50
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 25
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
6. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii)
7. Property classification: is equal to Mixed use
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
10. Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m): is less than 250
```

**Rationale:** Filters seek mid-acre urban mixed-use plots that already referenced “mixed use” in proposals, matching the precedent 8-storey approval. Low existing height/floors build in air-rights headroom, while high rail/bus accessibility and limited constraints align with tall building policy support, positioning projects to secure £2m+ profit uplifts via intensified resi units over Class E podiums.

**Strengths:**
- Directly mirrors planning language and scale of the approved 8-storey precedent.
- Targets high-accessibility plots that planners typically allow to reach 25-35m.
- Keeps land free of major constraints, accelerating programme to 12-24 months.

**Limitations:**
- Relies on accurate proposal text; may miss similar schemes described differently.
- Mixed-use classification data can be noisy; manual verification still required.
- Sites may already be under option by established developers.

**Implementation Strategy:** Export filtered titles, prioritise ones within boroughs known for tall building clusters. Use £120k option/JV premiums to secure control while commissioning massing studies and early transport statements. Re-engage planners referencing the prior approval type to evidence policy support for updated communal terraces, parking ratios, and Class E/C3 mix.

### Approach B: Airspace JV Pipeline
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6 – Airspace Development  
**Capital Required:** £90k option/roof-right premiums + £60k structural/feasibility + £50k planning/legal ≈ £200k total (roof-right JV model)  
**Expected Results:** 55-80 titles with flat roofs over urban retail parades

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.10 AND less than 0.60
2. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
5. Ownership type: is equal to Company
6. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2018
7. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
8. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 25
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 400
10. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
11. Sales listing price: is less than £750,000
```

**Rationale:** Focuses on long-held corporate assets with flat roofs and sub-15m heights—prime for bolt-on airspace schemes delivering new residential floors above existing Class E uses. Hardstanding-heavy plots in rail-adjacent cores support densification, while live listings plus low capital entry allow control via airspace options rather than freehold purchase.

**Strengths:**
- Flat-roof signal shortens structural due diligence for rooftop additions.
- Corporate vendors + long holds increase appetite for JV/airspace disposal.
- Transport-rich cores underpin premium resi values, supporting £2m profit aims.

**Limitations:**
- Requires complex structural warranties and party wall negotiations.
- Listing data may skew toward marketed assets, so competition elevated.
- Need to diligence building services upgrades (lifts, fire strategy) early.

**Implementation Strategy:** Approach vendors with roof-right JV pitch funded by £90k premiums to secure exclusivity. Run structural surveys and massing feasibility simultaneously, then submit Class AA-style schemes or full applications integrating cycle/terrace amenities mirroring the precedent. Use remainder of capital to cover planning pack and legal costs while lining up development finance once consented.

### Approach C: Stalled Mixed-Use Option Sweep
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1 – Expired/Stalled Planning  
**Capital Required:** £70k option fees + £80k planning reactivation + £50k technical surveys/legal ≈ £200k  
**Expected Results:** 30-45 titles with dormant mixed-use consents

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.20 AND less than 1.20
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
3. Last application submitted: is before 01/01/2023
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
5. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
6. Ownership type: is one of Company, Private
7. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
8. Sales listing price: is less than £500,000
9. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 60
10. Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m): is less than 300
```

**Rationale:** Combines stalled mixed-use applications, inactive buildings, and affordable asking prices to line up option deals on sub-£500k sites needing planning refresh. Transit proximity ensures policy support, while low constraint coverage keeps re-submission timelines tight enough to hit a 12-24 month profit window.

**Strengths:**
- Directly targets stalled planning stock ready for re-application uplift.
- Asking price cap aligns with option premiums well within £200k capital.
- Inactive buildings strengthen negotiation leverage for creative structures.

**Limitations:**
- Some applications may have lapsed due to fundamental planning refusal reasons.
- Need to confirm structural integrity and contamination before reactivating.
- Vendor expectations might still exceed valuation despite listing price filters.

**Implementation Strategy:** Prioritise sites with expired but approved concepts similar to the 8-storey reference, negotiate 12-18 month option using £70k deposit, and allocate remainder to refreshed design packs (cycle parking, terraces, accessibility). Submit updated schemes referencing precedent policy wins, then market JV equity or forward-fund sale once resolution to grant is secured.

Next steps (optional): 1) Validate counts by running each prompt across priority cities (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester). 2) Rank resulting titles by achievable resi net sellable area to confirm £2m margin, then advance the most compelling two into feasibility.
