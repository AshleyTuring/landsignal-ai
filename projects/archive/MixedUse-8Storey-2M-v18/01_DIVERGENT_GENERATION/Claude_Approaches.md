## Summary & Recommendation

I've generated **three completely independent approaches** using different strategic patterns:

| Approach | Pattern | Capital | Risk | Timeline | £2M Achievable? |
|----------|---------|---------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **A: Stalled Planning** | Expired Planning + Lease Expiry | £55k-£110k | Medium | 12-18m | ✅ Yes (planning consent sale) |
| **B: Airspace Rights** | Airspace + High Density | £95k-£225k | Medium-High | 12-24m | ⚠️ £1.5M likely (JV needed for £2M) |
| **C: Nutrient Neutrality** | Regulation + Time Arbitrage | £65k-£280k | Medium | 12-24m | ✅ Yes (if unlock stalled development) |

**My Recommendation for Testing Priority:**

1. **Test Approach A FIRST** (Stalled Planning): Lowest capital, clearest path to £2M, proven precedent
2. **Test Approach B in London/high PTAL areas** (Airspace): Direct precedent match, structural opportunity
3. **Test Approach C ONLY in Solent/Norfolk** (Nutrient Neutrality): Niche but potentially highest ROI if geography matches

All three approaches stay within (or close to) £200k capital by using **creative structures** (options, airspace rights, JV partnerships) rather than direct purchase—which is impossible at this budget for 8-storey developments.

**Next Steps:**
Run these filters through SearchLand in target geographies (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester) and evaluate result counts before moving to Stage 1 (Cross-Validation).
