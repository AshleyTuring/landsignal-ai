## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

# Filter Requirements

**Project:** MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v18  
**Date:** 2025-11-21  
**Status:** Ready for v5.2 Independent Generation (Single-Pass Test)  
**System Version:** 5.2 (Independent Generation with Iterative Convergence)

---

## Global Context

**You are an expert UK property analyst.**

You will work **independently** to generate 1-3 unique filter strategies based on the requirements below.

### Available Resources (included below in this prompt):
- **Available Filters List** - Real filters available in SearchLand (see REFERENCE section below)
- **Preset Examples** - 86 expert presets for inspiration
- **Learnings Database** - Universal implementation behaviors (20+ motivation signals!)
- **Filter Patterns** - 23 strategic patterns (v2.1 - peer reviewed by 4 LLMs)
- **Preset Strategy Guide** - Comprehensive guide to all 86 presets

**IMPORTANT:** All reference materials are included in this prompt. Do NOT attempt to read external files.

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. **Output Format**: Use STRUCTURED LIST FORMAT ONLY (not prose)
   - Example: `1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.198 AND less than 2.47`
   - NOT: "Look for properties between 8,000-100,000 sqft"
2. **Units**: Use acres/sqft/metres (as shown in ACTUAL filters)
3. **Filter Names**: Use EXACT names from AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
4. **No Assumptions**: If a filter doesn't exist, propose proxy filters
5. **Independent Generation**: Work independently - do NOT see other LLM outputs
6. **Diversity**: Generate approaches using DIFFERENT patterns from FILTER_PATTERNS.md

---

## Requirement Type

- [x] **Type 1: Profit & Capital Outlay**
- [x] **Type 2: Similar Planning Applications**

---

## Type 1: Profit & Capital Outlay

**Target Profit:** £2,000,000

**Capital Outlay:** £200,000

**Additional Context:**
- Property type preferences: Mixed-use development opportunities, airspace development, stalled planning
- Geographic preferences: UK-wide, focusing on urban areas with good transport
- Risk tolerance: Medium - seeking motivated sellers, creative structures
- Time horizon: 12-24 months to planning/deal completion
- Other considerations: £200k requires option agreements, airspace rights, joint ventures (not direct purchase)

---

## Type 2: Similar Planning Applications

### Planning Application 1:

**Description:**
```
Demolition and construction of an 8-storey mixed-use development comprising 
flexible retail (class E) and residential (Class C3) use with associated communal 
terraces, cycle parking, accessible car parking and waste storage
```

**Location:** Urban UK location (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester, etc.)  
**Decision:** Approved  

**Key Success Factors to Analyze:**
- **Development Type:** 8-storey mixed-use (Class E ground + C3 residential above)
- **Scale:** Substantial height (25-35m), multi-unit residential
- **Use Class Mix:** Flexible retail/commercial ground floor + residential above
- **Amenity:** Communal terraces, cycle parking, accessible parking
- **Policy Support:** Area supporting tall buildings/densification

**Implicit Characteristics to Find (At Least ONE of your approaches should target this):**
- Title area: Likely 0.2-2 acres (large enough for 8-storey with parking/amenity)
- Height potential: Building height <15m OR permission for 25-35m additions
- Use classes: E or previous commercial + permission for residential
- Transport: Likely <800m train OR PTAL 4+ (supports density)
- Constraints: Zero flood zone 3, minimal conservation areas
- Planning policy: Tall building zone OR opportunity area OR HDT

**Implementation Options:**
1. **Direct precedent:** Find similar 8-storey mixed-use approvals (2020+)
2. **Site characteristics:** Match area, height, transport, policy
3. **Adjacency:** Properties near approved 8-storey schemes
4. **Proxy approach:** Similar height/mixed-use applications

---

## Additional Requirements

**Priority Level:**
- [x] High - Need precise matches
- [ ] Medium - Some flexibility acceptable
- [ ] Low - Exploratory search

**Expected Number of Results:**
- [x] Narrow (10-50 properties per approach)
- [ ] Moderate (50-200 properties)
- [ ] Wide (200+ properties)

**Special Considerations:**
- £200k capital = option agreements (£10k-£50k), airspace rights (£50k-£150k), or joint ventures
- Direct purchase at £200k unrealistic for 8-storey developments
- Motivation signals critical: long hold, derelict/inactive, corporate, expired/stalled planning
- Multiple diverse strategies preferred (4+ approaches from 4 LLMs)
- Target £2M profit = 10x ROI (substantial upside required)

---

## Target Geographies

**Primary:**
- Slough (previous test location)

**Secondary (for testing):**
- Birmingham (lower prices, more options at £200k)
- Manchester (mid-range market)
- London (high PTAL, airspace opportunities, competitive)

**Rationale:** Different approaches may work better in different markets - test empirically

---

## Strategic Guidance (Use Your Unique Lens)

### Your Role in v5.2 System:
You are ONE of FOUR expert analysts (Gemini, Codex, Grok, Claude) working **independently**.

**All analysts receive identical prompts** - your unique analytical style emerges naturally.

**Note:** You don't need to know which LLM you are - just bring YOUR unique analytical perspective to the requirements.

### Pattern Suggestions (Choose 1-3 patterns for your approaches):

**Precedent-Based (At least ONE approach):**
- Pattern 3A: Similar planning approvals (8-storey mixed-use)
- Pattern 1A: Stalled planning (expired but resubmittable)
- Pattern 5A: Low-rise in tall building zones

**Capital-Efficient:**
- Pattern 4B: Option agreement candidates (£10k-£50k upfront)
- Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, £50k-£150k rights)
- Pattern 17A: Micro-infill service yards (small plots, £50k-£200k)

**Motivation-Driven:**
- Pattern 2D: Liquidation/Administration (forced sale)
- Pattern 2A: Long hold + derelict (estate planning)
- Pattern 14A: Legacy holdings (never sold, unaware value)

**Regulation-Driven:**
- Pattern 8A: HMO license expiry (forced sale)
- Pattern 8B: Lease expiry (income cliff)
- Pattern 18A: Nutrient neutrality (unblocked by credits)

**Time/Information Arbitrage:**
- Pattern 13A: Fresh planning consents (24h advantage)
- Pattern 13B: New allocations (emerging land)

**Niche Opportunities:**
- Pattern 20A: Brand covenant expiry (QSR swaps)
- Pattern 22A: HMO conversion (5-8% yields vs. 3-4% BTL)
- Pattern 23A: Unbroken freehold titles (no assembly risk)

## Key Learnings Applied (Refer to LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md for more)

**Filter Behavior:**
- "Applications in last 5 years = 0" too restrictive (try "< 3")
- £200k direct purchase extremely limited (need creative structures)
- PTAL filters London-only (use "Distance to Train Station" elsewhere)
- Units: acres (not sqm), sqft (not sqm), metres

**Motivation Signals (20+ in LEARNINGS_DATABASE):**
- Company status: Liquidation/Administration = forced sale
- No latest sold date = inherited/legacy holding
- HMO License Expiry Date = regulatory forced sale
- EPC rating E-G = cannot rent (compliance sale)
- Less than 1 application in 5 years = no development intent

**Proven Strategies (23 patterns in FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.1):**
- Pattern 13 (Time Arbitrage) = HIGHEST ROI per Grok
- Pattern 8 (Regulation) = HIGHEST CERTAINTY per Gemini/Codex
- Pattern 4 (Low Capital) = Enhanced in v2.1 with executable examples
- Pattern 22 (HMO Conversion) = NEW in v2.1 (Gemini + Grok consensus)
- Pattern 23 (Unbroken Freehold) = NEW in v2.1 (Gemini + Codex consensus)

## System Version History

**v5.2 (current):** Independent generation with iterative convergence  
- ✅ Real Gemini, Codex, Grok, Claude (not simulated)
- ✅ Independent generation (no forced collaboration, identical prompts)
- ✅ Natural convergence/divergence emerges organically
- ✅ Iterative convergence loop (cross-validation → iteration until agreement)
- ✅ Single-pass mode available for quick testing
- ✅ 23 patterns in FILTER_PATTERNS.md (v2.1 peer reviewed)

**v5.0 (2025-11-19):** Real LLM CLIs introduced  
**v4.0 (archived):** Echo chamber (Claude simulated all agents) - deprecated  
**v3.0-3.2 (archived):** Divergent generation experiments  
**v2.0 (archived):** Convergent refinement  
**v1.0 (archived):** Initial single approach (0 results)

---

**Next Step:** Run v5.2 single-pass system

```bash
cd /home/ashsubband/landsignal/projects/MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v18/.agents_v5
./RUN_ALL_v5.sh
```

This will execute (SINGLE-PASS MODE):
- Phase 0: Independent Generation (4 LLMs in parallel)
- Phase 1: Cross-Validation (4 LLMs review all approaches)
- Phase 1.5: Technical Iteration (if disagreements - ONE PASS ONLY)
- Phase 2: Synthesis & Extraction (Claude synthesizes)

**Note:** For iterative convergence (loops until agreement), use `./RUN_ALL_ITERATIVE_v5.sh`

Expected output: 4+ approaches ready for parallel testing (minimum 1 per LLM)

---

## 1. Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies

### Pattern A: Old Planning + No Recent Activity
```
Strategy: Find sites with old planning applications and no recent development activity
Indicators:
- Last application submitted: >2-3 years ago
- Applications in last 5 years: <3
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Max number of dwellings applied for: >0 (confirms development intent)

Strengths: Targets sites where planning work already done but stalled
Weaknesses: May miss sites with expired planning but recent resubmissions
Capital requirement: Varies (often requires on-market listing filter)
```

### Pattern B: Proposal Keyword + Inactive Building
```
Strategy: Search for specific development types with inactive buildings
Indicators:
- Proposal: contains "[development type]" keywords
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Title area: appropriate size for target development

Strengths: More flexible than date-based approaches
Weaknesses: Doesn't confirm planning has actually lapsed
Capital requirement: Add price filters as needed
```

---

```
Strategy: Corporate owners holding derelict assets for 5+ years
Indicators:
- Ownership type: Company
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago
- Building on title is derelict: Yes
- Optional: Sales listing currently on the market: Yes

Strengths: Strong motivation signals (asset write-down, non-core holding)

- Latest sold date: >3-5 years ago (long hold)

Strengths: Active sellers with demonstrated motivation
Weaknesses: Cannot directly filter for "time on market"
Capital requirement: Directly constrained by price filter
```

### Pattern C: Inactive Building + Transport Proximity
```
Strategy: Inactive/derelict properties near transport (redevelopment angle)
Indicators:
- Building on title is inactive OR derelict: Yes
- Distance to nearest Train Station: <500-1000m
- Title area: appropriate size

Strengths: Combines motivation with development rationale
Weaknesses: Transport proximity doesn't guarantee motivation
Capital requirement: Add price filters for low-capital approaches
```

## Collaborative Round Guide 🔄

Maps patterns to exploration rounds in the v3.2.0 workflow:

### Round 2: Precedent Analysis
**Goal:** Which patterns help replicate successful planning applications?
- Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning (find similar approved schemes)
- Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (PTAL matching)
- Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly (precedent for infill)
- Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion (prior approvals)

**Why these patterns?** These rely on demonstrating that similar developments have been approved nearby or on similar sites. Success depends on finding comparable precedents.

### Round 3: Regulation-Driven
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit regulatory drivers and deadlines?
- Pattern 7: Permitted Development (Class AA, Q, MA, ZA rights)
- Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Article 4, expiring conditions)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (enforcement, S215 notices)

**Why these patterns?** These opportunities are created by regulatory changes, deadlines, or enforcement actions that create urgency or unlock new rights.

### Round 4: Structural Arbitrage
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit physical characteristics and constraints?
- Pattern 6: Airspace Development (roof extensions, party wall arbitrage)
- Pattern 9: Green Belt/Strategic Land (boundary anomalies, brownfield)
- Pattern 3: Underutilized/Inefficient Sites (layout inefficiencies)
- Pattern 4: Title/Access Issues (ransom strips, easements)

**Why these patterns?** These exploit physical, spatial, or legal constraints that others overlook or cannot solve. Value creation comes from structural problem-solving.

### Round 5: Behavioral/Motivation
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit seller motivation and market timing?
- Pattern 2: Motivated Seller (estate settlements, divorces, financial distress)
- Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage (Advanced Workflow) (emerging allocations, infrastructure announcements)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (combined with motivation)

**Why these patterns?** These depend on understanding seller psychology, market inefficiencies, and information asymmetries. Success requires empathy and timing.

### Cross-Round Patterns
Some patterns work across multiple rounds:
- **Pattern 11** (Distressed Assets): Regulation-driven (enforcement) + Behavioral (motivated seller)
- **Pattern 1** (Expired Planning): Precedent Analysis (prior approval) + Behavioral (frustrated owner)
- **Pattern 13** (Time Arbitrage): Regulation-Driven (policy changes) + Behavioral (information gaps)
```

```

## 3. Development Opportunity Strategies

### Pattern A: Under-Developed + High Accessibility
```
Strategy: Low-density sites in high-transport-accessibility areas
Indicators:
- Max building height on title: <12m (low current density)
- TFL PTAL: 4, 5, 6a, 6b (London only) OR Distance to Train Station: <500m
- Developed area percentage: <40-50%
- Title area: appropriate for target development

Strengths: Clear redevelopment potential with policy support
Weaknesses: PTAL limited to London; may be expensive acquisitions
Capital requirement: Typically requires higher capital or creative financing
```

### Pattern B: Large Plot + Low Building Density
```
Strategy: Large plots with minimal existing development
Indicators:
- Title area (acres): >0.5
- Developed area percentage: <30%
- Number of buildings on title: 0 or 1
- Planning constraints: minimal

Strengths: Clean slate for development
Weaknesses: May require greenfield development expertise
Capital requirement: Land acquisition costs can be high
```

### Pattern C: Existing Use + Upside Potential
```
Strategy: Properties with established use but intensification potential
Indicators:
- Title area: appropriate size
- Max building height: <current vs target differential
- Use class: target class or compatible
- Percentage of plot un-constrained: >70%

Strengths: Income-generating during planning process
Weaknesses: May require change of use or intensification planning
Capital requirement: Higher due to existing use value
```

---

## 4. Low Capital Entry Strategies

**NOTE:** Enhanced in v2.1 based on Codex review - added concrete filter examples for executability

### Pattern A: Sub-£200k Direct Purchase
```
Strategy: Direct freehold/leasehold purchase under capital limit
Source: User strategy (no direct preset)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Sales listing price: is less than £200,000
2. Tenure: Freehold
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
4. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
5. Use class: Contains "Residential" OR "Mixed"
6. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3

Indicators:
- Sales listing price: <£200,000 (adjust to your capital)
- Tenure: Freehold (avoid leasehold complications)
- Title area: 0.1-0.5 acres (adequate size without excess land cost)
- On market: Yes (immediate availability)

Strengths: Direct acquisition within budget, clear pricing
Weaknesses: Very limited supply; may sacrifice quality/location
Capital requirement: Hard cap at budget limit (£10k-£200k typical)
```

### Pattern B: Option Agreement Candidates
```
Strategy: Higher-value sites suitable for option agreements (low upfront capital)
Source: User strategy + Pattern 2 (Motivated Seller) overlap

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Latest sold date: No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
2. Ownership type: Private owner OR Company
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no recent activity)
5. NOT: Sales listing currently on the market (off-market approach)
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago OR never sold (motivated seller potential)
- Ownership type: Private owner or Company (institutional negotiation)
- Title area: 1-10 acres (large enough for phased development)
- No recent applications (owner not actively developing)
- OFF-MARKET (no listing price filter - approach directly)

Strengths: Access to better sites with low initial capital (£10k-£50k option fee)
Weaknesses: Requires negotiation skills, legal costs, seller must agree
Capital requirement: £10k-£50k for option + £5k-£15k legals

Strategy Steps:
1. Identify site via filters above
2. Research title owner (Land Registry)
3. Approach with option proposal (planning-contingent)
4. Secure option for 12-24 months
5. Apply for planning or sell option to developer
```

### Pattern C: Derelict Asset Turnaround
```
Strategy: Severely derelict properties with rebuild/redevelopment angle
Source: User strategy + Pattern 2C (Motivated Seller) overlap

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Building on title is derelict: Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than £150,000 (adjust to budget - acquisition costs)
3. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 1000m (exit value/marketability)
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
5. Tenure: Freehold
6. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building (reduces complexity)

Indicators:
- Building derelict: Yes (distressed pricing)
- Listing price: <£150k (allows rebuild budget)
- Transport proximity: <1km train station (residential appeal)
- Title area: 0.05-0.25 acres (adequate but not excessive)
- Avoid conservation/listed (planning complexity)

Strengths: Discounted pricing, high upside potential (buy £100k, rebuild £100k, sell £300k)
Weaknesses: Requires construction expertise, hidden structural issues, planning risk
Capital requirement: 
- Acquisition: £50k-£150k
- Demolition: £10k-£30k
- Rebuild: £100k-£200k
- Total: £160k-£380k (phase if needed)
```

---

## 5. High-Density/Intensification Strategies

### Pattern A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone
```
Strategy: Existing low-rise in areas with tall building policy support
Indicators:
- Max building height on title: <12-15m (current low-rise)
- PTAL: 4-6b OR Distance to Train Station: <500m
- Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: 0%
- Local policy: (manual research: tall building zones)

Strengths: Policy support for height, existing access/utilities
Weaknesses: May face local opposition; requires tall building expertise
Capital requirement: Varies; consider airspace strategies
```

### Pattern B: Existing Approval for Height
```
Strategy: Sites with existing planning approval for tall buildings
Indicators:
- Proposal: contains "storey" AND specific height keywords
- Max number of dwellings applied for: >target threshold
- Last application submitted: recent (within 3 years)
- Building on title status: any

Strengths: Planning derisked, faster to implement
Weaknesses: May be priced at post-planning approval value
Capital requirement: Higher acquisition, lower planning risk
```

### Pattern C: Strategic Site Allocation
```
Strategy: Sites allocated for development in local plans
Indicators:
- Site allocation type: [specific allocation]
- Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA): positive
- In adopted settlement OR In emerging settlement: appropriate
- Title area: matches allocation size

Strengths: Policy-backed development rights
Weaknesses: May have Section 106/CIL obligations
Capital requirement: Varies by allocation
```

---

## 6. Airspace Development Strategies

### Pattern A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom
```
Strategy: Existing buildings with flat roofs and height capacity
Indicators:
- A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
- Max building height on title: <15m (headroom for addition)
- Maximum height of roof in the title: specific measurement
- PTAL: 4-6b OR Transport proximity: good

Strengths: Existing structure, utilities, access
Weaknesses: Structural assessment required, freeholder negotiation
Capital requirement: Airspace rights purchase (£20k-£100k) + build costs
```

### Pattern B: Low-Rise Commercial + Residential Overlay
```
Strategy: Low-rise commercial buildings in residential-friendly areas
Indicators:
- Max building height: <10m
- Use class: Commercial/retail
- Distance to nearest residential: nearby
- Transport accessibility: good

Strengths: PDR (Permitted Development Rights) potential for residential above
Weaknesses: Structural capacity unknown, leaseholder issues
Capital requirement: Airspace + conversion costs
```

Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

Strengths:
- Access to Green Belt locations (often cheaper)
- Exception to normal GB restrictions
- Less competition (many avoid GB entirely)

Weaknesses:
- Still needs planning (not automatic)
- Local opposition possible
- Must prove "previously developed"

Capital requirement: Often cheaper than pure urban (£50k-£300k)

Example Filters:

Grey Belt (Preset #7):
1. Freehold tenure
2. More than 25% area developed
3. More than 10% hardstanding (key indicator)
4. Within 100m of built up area
5. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3, National parks, Conservation area, etc.
6. 1,000+ sqmt

- Private owner (easier to deal)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 5% developed (undeveloped land)

Strategic Rationale:
- Local authorities review settlement boundaries periodically
- Sites on edges = natural expansion direction
- No SHLAA = no one else promoting (first mover advantage)
- Promote to get allocated in next local plan

Strengths:
- Lower competition (undiscovered)
- Can influence local plan
- Option agreements with minimal capital
- Value jump when allocated

Weaknesses:
- Long timeline (2-5 years for allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation
- Requires planning expertise

Capital requirement: Low for option (£5k-£50k), patient capital

Example Filters:

Edge of Settlement (Preset #18):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Private owner ownership
3. 1,000-8,000 sqmt
4. Less than 5% area developed
5. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no activity)

## Strategy Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern:

**Budget-Driven:**
- <£50k → Option Agreement, Airspace Rights
- £50k-£200k → Sub-£200k Direct, Derelict Turnaround
- £200k-£500k → Under-Developed + Accessibility, Stalled Planning
- >£500k → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Low risk → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations
- Medium risk → Stalled Planning, Under-Developed Sites
- High risk → Derelict Turnaround, Airspace Development

**Timeline:**
- Fast (<12 months) → Existing Approvals, Option Exercise
- Medium (12-24 months) → Stalled Planning Revival, Turnarounds
- Long (24+ months) → Greenfield Development, Strategic Allocations

**Expertise Required:**
- Low → Sub-£200k Direct Purchase, Simple Turnarounds
- Medium → Stalled Planning, Motivated Sellers
- High → Airspace Development, Tall Buildings, Strategic Sites

---

## Combining Patterns

### Example: "Mixed-Use 8-Storey £2M Profit on £200k Capital"

**Possible Approach Combinations:**

1. **Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A) + Motivated Seller (Pattern 2A)**
   - Find stalled mixed-use planning with corporate seller motivation
   - Low acquisition cost, planning precedent exists
   - Capital: option agreement or distressed purchase

2. **Under-Developed (Pattern 3A) + Airspace (Pattern 6A)**
   - High PTAL, flat roof, existing low-rise
   - Add 4-6 storeys of residential above
   - Capital: airspace rights + construction finance

3. **Derelict Turnaround (Pattern 4C) + Height Intensification (Pattern 5A)**
   - Derelict building in tall building zone
   - Demolish + rebuild to 8 storeys
   - Capital: acquisition + phased construction

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

# ADVANCED WORKFLOW

_This section contains meta-strategies that sit on top of the filter patterns._

---

## ⭐ HIGHEST ROI STRATEGY (Per Stage 2 Review)

**Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage)** has been relocated to this Advanced Workflow section because it is a **workflow process** rather than a filter pattern. However, peer reviews confirm it is **one of the HIGHEST ROI strategies**:

- **Grok (Stage 2):** Ranked #1 - "Force multiplier that converts SearchLand's 24-hour refresh into unique deal flow"
- **Codex (Stage 1):** Ranked #3 - "High ROI, needs tooling but strategic advantage"
- **Gemini (Stage 1):** Ranked #2 - "Brilliant concept, A-grade strategic value"

**Strategic Philosophy Difference:**
- **Speed/Timing Lens (Grok):** Time arbitrage = highest priority (be first to act)
- **Certainty Lens (Gemini/Codex):** Regulation-driven = highest priority (predictable triggers)
- **Both valid:** Choose based on your competitive advantage (speed vs. process)

**What Makes This Different:**
This is a **FORCE MULTIPLIER** - it doesn't replace other patterns, it amplifies them. Apply this workflow to ANY pattern you choose (Regulation, Motivated Seller, Planning, etc.) to gain a 24-hour speed advantage over competition.

---

## 13. Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies ⭐ NEW

**Core Concept:** SearchLand refreshes data every 24 hours. Speed advantage = profit advantage.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)
- Time arbitrage = price arbitrage
```

### Pattern 13B: Fresh Planning Consent Alert
```
Strategy: Contact owner same day planning consent granted
Indicators:
- Planning status: Approved (filter)
- Decision date: Last 7 days (custom monitoring)
- Your action: Call owner immediately

Example Script:
"Congratulations on your consent. I have a buyer ready to move. 
Would £580k interest you?" (Owner unaware of £650k market value)

Profit: £70k in 48 hours (user example)

Strengths: Maximum information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires daily monitoring, fast response capability
Capital: Option agreement or cash purchase ready
```

### Pattern 13C: Lease Expiry Pre-Contact (90-Day Window)
```
Strategy: Contact owner 90 days before lease expiry (before void period)
Indicators:
- Lease end date: 60-120 days from today
- Use class: Commercial (E, B2, B8)
- Your offer: "Avoid void period, we have buyers ready"

Owner Psychology:
- 90 days out: Starting to worry about vacancy
- 30 days out: Panicking about lost income
- Post-expiry: Maximum pressure (carrying costs, no income)

Profit Source: Buy at "pre-panic" price, sell at market
```

### Pattern 13D: New Allocation Alert (Local Plan)
```
Strategy: Contact owner when site added to local plan allocations
Indicators:
- Housing allocation: Emerging (NEW)
- Applications in last 5 years: 0 (owner unaware)
- Your action: "Your site just got allocated—let's discuss before agent calls"

Example:
Day 1: SearchLand shows site added to emerging allocations
Day 1 (same day): You call owner offering £300k
Owner thinks: "My land was worth £150k yesterday, £300k is amazing!"
Reality: Market value post-allocation = £500k
Your profit: £200k by being first

Strengths: Massive information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires immediate action (speed critical)
```

### Pattern 13E: Fast Food Lease Expiry (High Visibility)
```
Strategy: Target high-footfall commercial with expiring leases
Indicators:
- Use class: E (restaurants/retail)
- Lease end date: Last 30 days (just expired)
- Footfall count: >2000/day (high value)
- Your action: Contact landlord (now in void period, cash flow pressure)

Why This Works:
- High footfall = high value but landlord may not realize
- Void period = immediate cash flow pressure
- Can offer "quick sale to avoid prolonged void"

Buyers: Fast food chains, convenience stores (high footfall valuable)
```

### Implementation Requirements

**System Setup:**
1. **Daily Automated Exports**
   - Export target filter results as CSV/JSON
   - Store with timestamp
   - Compare today vs yesterday (diff script)

2. **Alert Triggers**
   - New properties added: Email notification
   - Status changes: SMS + Email
   - Approaching thresholds (e.g., 90 days to lease expiry): Weekly digest

3. **Response Protocol**
   - Same-day contact for fresh consents
   - Script templates for different scenarios
   - Cash/option ready to move fast

**Tools Needed:**
- SearchLand API (or automated export)
- Diff comparison script (Python/Node)
- Email/SMS alerting system
- CRM for tracking contacts

### Capital Strategy

**Speed Capital:**
- Keep £50k-£200k liquid for immediate deployment
- Option agreements (£10k-£50k) for fast control
- Bridging finance arranged in advance (no delays)

**Profit Model:**
- Time arbitrage: Buy at "uninformed" price, sell at "informed" price
- Typical spread: 10-30% (£50k-£200k on £500k deal)
- Volume strategy: 10-20 deals/year = £500k-£2M profit

### Strengths
1. **Information asymmetry:** You know before owner/market
2. **No competition:** Pre-market, no agents, no bidders
3. **Premium pricing:** Buyers pay for exclusivity
4. **Scalable:** Automated monitoring, repeatable process
5. **High ROI:** Low capital, high profit margins

### Weaknesses
1. **Requires daily monitoring:** Labor-intensive or requires automation
2. **Speed critical:** Miss by 1 day = opportunity lost
3. **Competitive advantage erodes:** Once others adopt same strategy
4. **SearchLand dependency:** 24hr refresh only (not real-time)
5. **Execution risk:** Owner may not want to sell, buyer may back out

### Example Deal Flow

**Day 1 Morning:**
- SearchLand export shows planning consent granted yesterday
- Property: 4-unit scheme, Camden, owner-occupied

**Day 1 Afternoon:**
- Call owner: "Congratulations! I have a buyer at £580k, quick completion"
- Owner (unaware of £650k market value): "Yes, that sounds great!"

**Day 2:**
- Option agreement signed (£10k, 30-day exercise)
- Call buyer network: "Fresh consent, Camden, 4 units, £650k"
- Buyer: "Pre-vetted, no competition? Yes."

**Day 3-30:**
- Due diligence, legal, exercise option
- Completion: You buy £580k, sell £650k
- **Net profit: £60k** (after legals/costs)

**Annualized: 10 deals = £600k profit from speed arbitrage alone**

---

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### ❌ Over-Constraining
```
Problem: Combining too many restrictive filters
Example: Applications = 0 AND Price <£200k AND Derelict AND On-market AND PTAL 6a
Result: 0 results (filters compound restrictiveness)
Solution: Test incrementally, use separate filter groups for different approaches
```

### ❌ Geographic Mismatches
```
Problem: Using London-specific filters (PTAL) for UK-wide searches
Example: PTAL filter outside TfL area
Result: 0 results
Solution: Create separate approaches for London vs rest of UK
```

### ❌ Assuming Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem: Designing strategy around filters that don't exist
Example: "Planning Status: Expired" or "Price Reduced"
Result: Cannot implement strategy
Solution: Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md first
```

## 22. HMO Conversion Strategies ⭐ NEW (Stage 2 - Gemini + Grok)

**Added based on Stage 2 peer review - both Gemini and Grok independently suggested this pattern**

### Pattern 22A: University/Hospital Proximity HMO
```
Strategy: Target properties suitable for HMO conversion near education/healthcare demand
Source: Derived from regulation-driven patterns + market analysis
Proposed by: Gemini + Grok (Stage 2 consensus)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Existing Use Class: C3 (residential dwelling)
2. Title area (sqm): is greater than 100 AND less than 300
3. Distance to nearest university: less than 1000m
   OR Distance to nearest hospital: less than 1000m
4. Sales listing price: is less than £400,000
5. NOT: Article 4 direction HMO areas (manual check required)
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- Existing C3 residential (avoids commercial complications)
- Size: 100-300 sqm (adequate for 4-6 bedrooms)
- Proximity: <1km to university/hospital (tenant demand)
- Capital: <£400k (allows £50k-£100k conversion costs)
- Freehold: Easier to convert than leasehold

Strategic Rationale:
- Strong rental yields: 5-8% vs. 3-4% standard BTL
- Planning permission often not required (if <7 occupants, no Article 4)
- Professional tenant base (students/NHS staff)
- Lower voids due to institutional demand

Strengths:
- Higher yields than standard residential
- Established demand (universities/hospitals don't relocate)
- Can often convert without planning (check local policy)
- Exit strategy: Hold for yield OR sell to HMO operator

Weaknesses:
- Management intensive (multiple tenants, higher turnover)
- Licensing required in some areas (check LPA HMO licensing)
- Article 4 directions restrict conversions in some zones
- Fire safety/building regs more stringent

Capital requirement:
- Acquisition: £150k-£400k
- Conversion: £50k-£100k (bedrooms, ensuites, fire doors, certification)
- Licensing/legals: £5k-£15k
- Total: £205k-£515k

Planning Check:
- Confirm no Article 4 direction for HMOs in area
- Check if area is "cumulative impact zone" (HMO saturation)
- Verify local HMO licensing requirements
- <7 occupants usually permitted development (sui generis not required)

Exit Strategy:
1. Hold for rental income (5-8% yield)
2. Sell to HMO portfolio investor (premium vs. C3)
3. Convert back to C3 if market changes
```

### Pattern 22B: Transport Hub HMO
```
Strategy: HMO conversion targeting young professionals near transport
Source: User strategy (Stage 2 addition)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Existing Use Class: C3 (residential)
2. Title area (sqm): is greater than 120 AND less than 250
3. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 500m
4. PTAL: 4, 5, 6a, or 6b (London only - OR use train station proxy)
5. Sales listing price: is less than £500,000
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- C3 residential baseline
- 120-250 sqm (5-6 bedroom potential)
- <500m train station (commuter appeal)
- High PTAL or transport links
- Freehold preferred

Strategic Rationale:
- Young professional market (stable, higher income)
- Transport proximity = premium rents
- Lower management burden than student HMOs
- Strong capital appreciation in transport zones

Capital requirement:
- Acquisition: £250k-£500k
- Conversion: £60k-£120k
- Total: £310k-£620k
```

## 23. Unbroken Freehold Titles ⭐ NEW (Stage 2 - Gemini + Codex)

**Added based on Stage 2 peer review - both Gemini and Codex highlighted title assembly risk**

### Pattern 23A: Single-Title Large Parcels
```
Strategy: Target large development sites held as single freehold title (no assembly risk)
Source: SearchLand Preset #69 + reviewer insight
Proposed by: Gemini + Codex (Stage 2 consensus)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Freehold tenure: Yes
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 2 AND less than 20
3. Less than 10% area developed (development potential)
4. Ownership type: Private owner OR Company (single negotiation)
5. NOT: Multiple ownerships on site (manual title check)
6. NOT: Ransom strips (manual diligence)

Indicators:
- Freehold: Full control, no lease complications
- Single title: Ideally one title number (check Land Registry)
- Large parcel: 2-20 acres (meaningful development)
- Low development: <10% built (greenfield/brownfield opportunity)
- Single owner: One negotiation vs. multiple landowners

Strategic Rationale:
- **Assembly Risk Elimination:** No ransom strips, access disputes, or holdouts
- **Planning Simplification:** Single title = simpler red line boundary
- **Negotiation Efficiency:** One owner, one deal, one legal process
- **Exit Certainty:** Clean title = easier to sell to housebuilder

Strengths:
- No title assembly complexity (major risk reduction)
- Single negotiation (faster, lower legal costs)
- Planning applications simpler (no multi-owner complications)
- Housebuilders pay premium for clean title

Weaknesses:
- Single large parcels rarer than fragmented sites
- Owner knows site value (less negotiation leverage)
- Higher capital requirement (buying entire parcel)

Capital requirement:
- Varies by site: £500k-£10M+ (often institutional)
- Option agreements possible: £50k-£200k (secure site, lower upfront)
- Consider JV with housebuilder (reduces capital requirement)

Due Diligence Critical:
1. **Title check:** Verify single title number (Land Registry search)
2. **Access:** Confirm no ransom strips or third-party access requirements
3. **Easements:** Check for restrictive covenants or utility easements
4. **Boundaries:** Verify no boundary disputes with neighbors
5. **Planning history:** Check for previous applications/refusals

Strategy:
1. Filter for large freehold parcels
2. Verify single title via Land Registry
3. Check access (no ransom strips)
4. Assess planning potential
5. Negotiate direct OR secure option
6. Exit to housebuilder with planning or at land stage
```

### Pattern 23B: No Lease Complications
```
Strategy: Freehold sites avoiding leasehold complexities
Source: User strategy (Stage 2 addition)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Freehold tenure: Yes
2. NOT: Leasehold interests on site
3. NOT: Ground rent obligations
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5
5. Ownership type: Private owner (direct negotiation)

Indicators:
- Pure freehold (no leasehold layers)
- No ground rent complications
- No lease expiry issues
- Direct ownership path

Strategic Rationale:
- Leasehold can complicate planning/development
- Freeholder consent often required
- Ground rent obligations reduce value
- Simpler exit to developers

Strengths: Clean ownership, lower legal costs, easier financing
Weaknesses: May miss some opportunities (some leaseholds are viable)
Capital requirement: Varies by site size
```

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

Example:
1. [Exact filter usage]

Performance/Notes:
- [Any observations]
```
Related: [Link to FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable]
```

### Recent Contributions:

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## Executive Summary

SearchLand's team has created **86 preset filters** representing validated, expert-designed property strategies. This guide extracts key insights, patterns, and strategic approaches for reuse in custom filter creation.

**Key Discovery:** These presets reveal advanced techniques not documented elsewhere:
- Regulation-driven motivations (HMO licenses, lease expiries, EPC compliance)
- Renewable energy site selection (agricultural grades, substation proximity)
- Green Belt workarounds (previously developed land, hardstanding)
- Commercial viability metrics (footfall/vehicle counts)
- Strategic land promotion (emerging allocations, SHLAA gaps)

## Preset Categories (Detailed)

### Category 1: Permitted Development Rights (PDR) - 7 Presets

**Strategy:** Bypass full planning via PDR routes

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 4 | Class MA (pre-configured) | E commercial → residential, 2yr use, <4,000 sqmt | £100k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 6 | Class Q (pre-configured) | Agricultural → residential, suitable structure | £50k-£300k | 12-24m |
| 8 | Infill (pre-configured) | C3 + space for additional dwelling, road access | £50k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 30 | Class A | Houses: extensions/alterations, 7m+ height | £50k-£200k | 6-12m |
| 31 | Class G | Space above shops → 2 flats, <250 sqmt | £50k-£200k | 12-18m |
| 32 | Class MA eligible | E commercial in built-up, 100-8,000 sqmt | £100k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 33 | Class ZA | Small commercial rebuild, <1,000 sqmt, <18m height | £100k-£400k | 12-18m |

**Strategic Insights:**
- PDR = faster than planning (6-12 months vs 12-24 months)
- Class MA most popular (SearchLand calculates profit automatically)
- Size restrictions critical (e.g., Class G limited to 250 sqmt, 2 flats max)
- Conservation areas and AONB excluded from most PDR

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 7A-7D

---

### Category 2: Airspace Development - 4 Presets

**Strategy:** Add storeys to existing buildings (flat roofs)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 22 | Airspace: 8+ addresses | Flats, flat roof, 8+ units, freehold | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 23 | Airspace: Commercial no resi | E commercial, flat roof, no C3 | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 24 | Airspace: Pre-1990 | Built ≤1990, flat roof, 8+ units | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 25 | Airspace: Unbroken freeholds | <1 leasehold, flat roof, 8+ units | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |

**Strategic Insights:**
- Flat roof = essential filter
- Freehold = simpler negotiation (no head lease)
- Pre-1990 = often undervalued, structural capacity varies
- Unbroken freeholds = no leaseholders to negotiate with
- Structural survey critical (cost £5k-£15k)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 6A-6B

---

### Category 3: Renewable Energy - 13 Presets

**Strategy:** Solar, wind, BESS, hydrogen, bio-energy projects

#### Solar Projects (5 presets)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |

| 45 | Ground-mounted solar GB | Green Belt + "ground mounted" + "solar" proposal | Varies | 24-36m |

**Strategic Insights - Solar:**
- **Ground mount:** Agricultural Grade 3b/4 essential (Grade 1-2 = planning refusal)
- **Rooftop:** Target high-energy users (manufacturing, warehousing)
- **Owner-occupied:** Easier than landlord/tenant (split incentive)
- **SIC code targeting:** Paper, poultry, manufacturing = high energy bills

**Strategic Insights - Other Renewable:**
- **Substation proximity CRITICAL:** <2km for solar/wind/BESS, <200m for hydrogen
- **Green rated substation:** Must have capacity (grid connection expensive if not)
- **Safety buffers:** Hydrogen >500m from schools/hospitals/care homes
- **Scale:** All require large capital (institutional investors)

### Category 4: Regulation-Driven Opportunities - 6 Presets

**Strategy:** Regulation forces owner action (motivates sale)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 12 | HMO expired licenses | HMO license expired | Cannot operate legally | £100k-£400k |
| 17 | Commercial expiring leases | Lease ends <2027, B2/B8/E, stale | Income cliff approaching | £200k-£1M+ |
| 41 | Fast food expired leases | E(b) food/drink, lease expired | Income ended | £100k-£500k |
| 46 | High footfall lease expiry | 6k+ footfall, lease 6-12m | Prime location, motivated | £500k-£3M+ |
| 66 | Office blocks expiring | E(g) offices, lease <2026 | Income ending | £300k-£2M+ |
| 78 | Single flats expiring leases | C3 flat, lease <2099, 1 address | Lease running out | £50k-£300k |

**Additional EPC-Related (implicit regulation):**

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2 | Run down homes | EPC E/F/G, detached, <30% developed | Cannot rent legally | £100k-£400k |
| 20 | Unsold poor EPC | EPC E/F/G, sold before 2004 (20+ years!) | Cannot rent + tired owner | £50k-£300k |
| 36 | ECO4 | EPC E/F/G, 5+ addresses, private owner | Grant-eligible improvements | £200k-£1M |
| 47 | HMO opportunities | 8-12 rooms, low EPC, sold before 2014 | Conversion + improvement needed | £150k-£500k |
| 67 | Offices low EPC | EPC D/E/F/G, E commercial, office type | High energy costs | £200k-£1M+ |
| 69 | Older houses outdoor space | No sold date, low EPC, no apps 5 years | Legacy holding + cannot rent | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **HMO licenses:** Expired = illegal to operate → forced renewal (£1k-£3k) or sale
- **Lease expiry:** 6-12 months = peak motivation (owner deciding)
- **Vacant post-expiry:** Strongest signal (no income, carrying costs)
- **EPC E-G:** Cannot rent in private sector since 2020 → improvement (£5k-£50k) or sale
- **Combine signals:** E.g., expired HMO license + low EPC = double motivation

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A-8C

### Category 5: Green Belt Strategies - 5 Presets

**Strategy:** Exploit "previously developed" and edge-of-settlement exceptions

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategic Rationale | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| 7 | Grey Belt | 25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding, GB, <100m built-up | Previously developed exception | £50k-£300k |
| 43 | GB sites with hardstanding | 1%+ GB, 1k-10k sqmt, built-up or <100m | Edge + previous development | £50k-£300k |
| 44 | Grey Belt low GB review | GB Review score 1-2, 25%+ hardstanding, <100m built-up | Low environmental impact | £50k-£300k |
| 45 | Ground-mounted solar GB | Proposal "ground mounted" + "solar", GB | Renewable energy exception | £500k-£5M |
| 57 | Storage in Green Belt | Built-up, B2/B8, 0-20% developed, NOT GB (!?) | Note: Preset name misleading | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Previously developed land:** >10-30% hardstanding = brownfield status
- **Hardstanding = proxy:** Concrete/asphalt from demolished buildings, car parks
- **Edge of settlement:** <100m from built-up = less "green" objection
- **Green Belt Review scores:** 1-2 = low landscape/environmental value
- **Planning still required:** These are exceptions, not guarantees
- **Less competition:** Many developers avoid GB entirely (opportunity)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A-9B

| 26 | Allocated 5-50 acres | 20k-200k sqmt, employment allocation, <100m A/B road | Strategic employment land | £1M+ per acre |
| 38 | Emerging sites no planning | Emerging allocation, <1 app, 4k-40k sqmt | First mover advantage | £10k-£50k option |
| 63 | Planning 10-100 units | 8k+ sqmt, 10-100 dwellings applied, in settlement | Existing planning | £500k-£5M |
| 75 | Residential allocations | 4k-40k sqmt, housing/mixed allocation, private | Policy-backed sites | £100k-£1M+ |
| 85 | Un-allocated no SHLAA 1-10 acres | NOT SHLAA, NOT allocated, <50m settlement, 4k-40k sqmt | Hidden gems to promote | £10k-£50k option |
| 86 | Un-allocated private 4k+ sqmt | Private, 4k+ sqmt, NOT allocated, <200m settlement | Edge promotion | £10k-£50k option |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Emerging allocations (#38):** Allocated but no planning yet = first mover advantage
- **No SHLAA (#85, #86):** Not assessed by authority = hidden opportunity to promote
- **Edge of settlement:** <50-200m from boundary = natural expansion direction
- **"No latest sold date":** Never sold = inherited/legacy (may not know value)
- **Option agreements:** Low capital (£10k-£50k), control site, promote to LA
- **Timelines:** 2-5 years for allocation → planning → sale
- **Planning expertise:** Essential for promotion strategies

## Key Strategic Learnings from Presets

### 1. Motivation Signals (NEW - from Preset Analysis)

**Regulation-Driven (Strongest):**
- ⚠️ HMO License Expiry Date (cannot operate)
- ⚠️ Lease end date (income cliff)
- ⚠️ EPC E-G rating (cannot rent)

**Time-Based:**
- No latest sold date (never sold = legacy)
- Latest sold date >20 years ago
- <1 application in last 5 years (no activity)

**Corporate:**
- Company status: Liquidation (from user discovery)
- 30+ titles owned (portfolio divestment)

### 2. Previously Undocumented Filters

**From Preset Analysis:**
- `Hardstanding percentage` (proxy for previously developed)
- `Agricultural Land Grade` (energy project viability)
- `SHLAA status` (strategic land indicator)
- `Green Belt Review score` (environmental impact)
- `SIC codes` (industry targeting)
- `Average daily footfall` (commercial viability)
- `Average daily vehicle count` (traffic-dependent viability)
- `Distance to green rated substation` (energy projects)
- `EPC recommendations contains "solar"` (improvement suggestions)

### 3. Clever Filter Combinations

**ANY Logic (Accessibility):**
Preset #10 (Padel):
```
Within 400m of bus stop OR
Within 800m of train station OR
Within 5m of built up area
```
→ Flexible accessibility requirements

**Compound Targeting:**
Preset #7 (Grey Belt):
```
Green Belt location +
25%+ developed +
10%+ hardstanding +
Within 100m built-up +
NOT: [long list of absolute constraints]
```
→ Multiple signals = "previously developed in GB"

**Strategic Constraint Targeting:**
Preset #13 (Edge of Settlement):
```
1-99% green belt coverage OR
1-99% another constraint coverage
```
→ Targets edge cases (partially constrained = opportunity)

### 4. Threshold Insights

**Commercial Viability:**
- 800+ footfall = Viable cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = Prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = Viable petrol/drive-thru/EV

**Energy Projects:**
- <2,000m substation = Solar/wind/BESS viable
- <200m substation = Hydrogen viable (high power)
- <5,000m substation = EV charging viable

**Size Thresholds:**
- Class MA: <4,000 sqmt title
- Class G: <250 sqmt (only 2 flats)
- Solar ground mount: >40,000 sqmt (10 acres min)
- BESS: 20,000-400,000 sqmt (5-100 acres)

**Hardstanding (Previously Developed):**
- 10%+ = Minimal indicator
- 25-30%+ = Clear previously developed
- 40%+ = Significant (car parks)

5. **Test empirically** (presets are proven but adapt to market)

### For Divergent Approach Generation:

- **Use presets as inspiration** for diverse approaches
- **Different preset categories** = different approaches
- **Combine patterns** (e.g., HMO expiry + low EPC + edge settlement)
- **Don't copy exactly** - adapt and improve

### For Validation:

- **Check against AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md**
- **Verify filter names exactly match**
- **Confirm units (acres/sqft/metres)**
