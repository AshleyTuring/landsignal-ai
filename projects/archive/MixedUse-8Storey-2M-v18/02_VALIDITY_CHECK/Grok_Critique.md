### Claude - Approach A: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md. Units are correct (acres for area, metres for distances/heights). Syntax is valid (AND ranges, contains, is greater than/less than). Logically coherent with stalled planning strategy via proposal keywords and low activity signals. Capital (£55k-£110k) is feasible within £200k via options/JV. ROI (£2M) achievable through planning consent sale. Implementation viable with option structures. Deal structure (options/JV) is sound for capital efficiency.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Strong precedent focus; complements airspace approaches.

### Claude - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with airspace strategy via flat roofs and corporate long-hold signals. Capital (£95k-£225k) slightly exceeds £200k but mitigated by JV model. ROI (£1.5M likely, £2M with JV) achievable. Implementation viable. Deal structure (airspace rights/JV) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** Capital slightly over budget without JV.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** Emphasize JV partnerships to stay under £200k; validate structural feasibility early.

**Strategic Notes:** High-risk airspace; pairs well with stalled planning for diversification.

### Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with stalled planning via old applications and inactivity. Capital (£65k-£280k) exceeds £200k but summary notes creative structures mitigate. ROI achievable via unlocking stalled sites. Implementation viable. Deal structure (options) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** Capital over budget; nutrient neutrality niche may limit geography.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** Restrict to Solent/Norfolk for nutrient neutrality; use options to cap capital.

**Strategic Notes:** Regulation arbitrage; niche but high-ROI if geography matches.

### Codex - Approach A: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with tall podium strategy via proposal keywords and height headroom. Capital (£120k) feasible within £200k via options/JV. ROI achievable via intensified units. Implementation viable. Deal structure (options/JV) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Direct precedent replication; overlaps Claude A but adds JV emphasis.

### Codex - Approach B: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with airspace via flat roofs and corporate signals. Capital (£90k) feasible. ROI achievable. Implementation viable. Deal structure (roof-right JV) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Corporate focus; complements Gemini B.

### Codex - Approach C: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with stalled planning via old apps and prices. Capital (£70k-£200k) feasible. ROI achievable. Implementation viable. Deal structure (options) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Motivated seller angle; overlaps Claude C.

### Gemini - Approach A: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with intensification via low height and transport. Capital (£50k-£100k) feasible. ROI achievable via uplift. Implementation viable. Deal structure (options) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Broad use class; urban focus.

### Gemini - Approach B: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with airspace via freehold and few leases. Capital (£75k-£150k) feasible. ROI achievable. Implementation viable. Deal structure (airspace rights) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Freehold emphasis; high capital efficiency.

### Gemini - Approach C: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid (NOT supported). Logically coherent with distressed assets via liquidation. Capital (£200k) at limit but feasible for conditional purchase. ROI achievable via discounts. Implementation viable. Deal structure (conditional purchase) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Forced sale signal; high-motivation focus.

### Grok - Approach A: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid (AND in contains). Logically coherent with precedent via specific keywords. Capital (£50k-£150k) feasible. ROI derisked. Implementation viable. Deal structure (options) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Narrow precedent; planning-focused.

### Grok - Approach B: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with legacy holdings via no sold date. Capital (£30k-£120k) feasible. ROI via pipeline. Implementation viable. Deal structure (options) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** Title area up to 5 acres may be large for 8-storey, but valid.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Never-sold proxy; low capital.

### Grok - Approach C: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist. Units correct. Syntax valid. Logically coherent with airspace in hubs. Capital (£80k-£180k) feasible. ROI achievable. Implementation viable. Deal structure (airspace rights) sound.

**Technical Issues (if any):** None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):** N/A.

**Strategic Notes:** Transport hub focus; airspace variant.
