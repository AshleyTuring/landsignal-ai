## Summary & Recommendation

I've generated **three completely independent approaches** using different strategic patterns:

| Approach | Pattern | Capital | Risk | Timeline | £2M Achievable? |
|----------|---------|---------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **A: Stalled Planning** | Expired Planning + Lease Expiry | £55k-£110k | Medium | 12-18m | ✅ Yes (planning consent sale) |
| **B: Airspace Rights** | Airspace + High Density | £95k-£225k | Medium-High | 12-24m | ⚠️ £1.5M likely (JV needed for £2M) |
| **C: Nutrient Neutrality** | Regulation + Time Arbitrage | £65k-£280k | Medium | 12-24m | ✅ Yes (if unlock stalled development) |

**My Recommendation for Testing Priority:**

1. **Test Approach A FIRST** (Stalled Planning): Lowest capital, clearest path to £2M, proven precedent
2. **Test Approach B in London/high PTAL areas** (Airspace): Direct precedent match, structural opportunity
3. **Test Approach C ONLY in Solent/Norfolk** (Nutrient Neutrality): Niche but potentially highest ROI if geography matches

All three approaches stay within (or close to) £200k capital by using **creative structures** (options, airspace rights, JV partnerships) rather than direct purchase—which is impossible at this budget for 8-storey developments.

**Next Steps:**
Run these filters through SearchLand in target geographies (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester) and evaluate result counts before moving to Stage 1 (Cross-Validation).

### Codex_Approaches

### Approach A: Tall Podium Replication
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5 – High-Density/Intensification  
**Capital Required:** £120k option premiums + £50k planning/design + £30k surveys/contingency ≈ £200k (structured through option/JV rather than purchase)  
**Expected Results:** 45-65 titles nationwide in PTAL-rich urban cores

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.20 AND less than 1.50
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 25
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4
6. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii)
7. Property classification: is equal to Mixed use
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
10. Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m): is less than 250
```

**Rationale:** Filters seek mid-acre urban mixed-use plots that already referenced “mixed use” in proposals, matching the precedent 8-storey approval. Low existing height/floors build in air-rights headroom, while high rail/bus accessibility and limited constraints align with tall building policy support, positioning projects to secure £2m+ profit uplifts via intensified resi units over Class E podiums.

**Strengths:**
- Directly mirrors planning language and scale of the approved 8-storey precedent.
- Targets high-accessibility plots that planners typically allow to reach 25-35m.
- Keeps land free of major constraints, accelerating programme to 12-24 months.

**Limitations:**
- Relies on accurate proposal text; may miss similar schemes described differently.
- Mixed-use classification data can be noisy; manual verification still required.
- Sites may already be under option by established developers.

**Implementation Strategy:** Export filtered titles, prioritise ones within boroughs known for tall building clusters. Use £120k option/JV premiums to secure control while commissioning massing studies and early transport statements. Re-engage planners referencing the prior approval type to evidence policy support for updated communal terraces, parking ratios, and Class E/C3 mix.

---

### Approach B: Airspace JV Pipeline
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6 – Airspace Development  
**Capital Required:** £90k option/roof-right premiums + £60k structural/feasibility + £50k planning/legal ≈ £200k total (roof-right JV model)  
**Expected Results:** 55-80 titles with flat roofs over urban retail parades

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.10 AND less than 0.60
2. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
5. Ownership type: is equal to Company
6. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2018
7. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
8. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 25
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 400
10. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
11. Sales listing price: is less than £750,000
```

**Rationale:** Focuses on long-held corporate assets with flat roofs and sub-15m heights—prime for bolt-on airspace schemes delivering new residential floors above existing Class E uses. Hardstanding-heavy plots in rail-adjacent cores support densification, while live listings plus low capital entry allow control via airspace options rather than freehold purchase.

**Strengths:**
- Flat-roof signal shortens structural due diligence for rooftop additions.
- Corporate vendors + long holds increase appetite for JV/airspace disposal.
- Transport-rich cores underpin premium resi values, supporting £2m profit aims.

**Limitations:**
- Requires complex structural warranties and party wall negotiations.
- Listing data may skew toward marketed assets, so competition elevated.
- Need to diligence building services upgrades (lifts, fire strategy) early.

**Implementation Strategy:** Approach vendors with roof-right JV pitch funded by £90k premiums to secure exclusivity. Run structural surveys and massing feasibility simultaneously, then submit Class AA-style schemes or full applications integrating cycle/terrace amenities mirroring the precedent. Use remainder of capital to cover planning pack and legal costs while lining up development finance once consented.

---

### Approach C: Stalled Mixed-Use Option Sweep
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1 – Expired/Stalled Planning  
**Capital Required:** £70k option fees + £80k planning reactivation + £50k technical surveys/legal ≈ £200k  
**Expected Results:** 30-45 titles with dormant mixed-use consents

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.20 AND less than 1.20
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
3. Last application submitted: is before 01/01/2023
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
5. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
6. Ownership type: is one of Company, Private
7. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
8. Sales listing price: is less than £500,000
9. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 60
10. Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m): is less than 300
```

**Rationale:** Combines stalled mixed-use applications, inactive buildings, and affordable asking prices to line up option deals on sub-£500k sites needing planning refresh. Transit proximity ensures policy support, while low constraint coverage keeps re-submission timelines tight enough to hit a 12-24 month profit window.

**Strengths:**
- Directly targets stalled planning stock ready for re-application uplift.
- Asking price cap aligns with option premiums well within £200k capital.
- Inactive buildings strengthen negotiation leverage for creative structures.

**Limitations:**
- Some applications may have lapsed due to fundamental planning refusal reasons.
- Need to confirm structural integrity and contamination before reactivating.
- Vendor expectations might still exceed valuation despite listing price filters.

**Implementation Strategy:** Prioritise sites with expired but approved concepts similar to the 8-storey reference, negotiate 12-18 month option using £70k deposit, and allocate remainder to refreshed design packs (cycle parking, terraces, accessibility). Submit updated schemes referencing precedent policy wins, then market JV equity or forward-fund sale once resolution to grant is secured.

---

Next steps (optional): 1) Validate counts by running each prompt across priority cities (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester). 2) Rank resulting titles by achievable resi net sellable area to confirm £2m margin, then advance the most compelling two into feasibility.

## Approach A: Urban Intensification Precedent

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone
**Capital Required:** £50,000 - £100,000 (Option Agreement & Initial Surveys)
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.0
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
4. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8, Sui Generis
5. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
6. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
7. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
8. Ownership type: is one of Company, Private owner
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets the implicit characteristics of the 8-storey mixed-use planning precedent. It identifies under-developed sites (low-rise buildings) in high-density urban locations (close to train stations) that have the physical footprint for a substantial development. By filtering for existing commercial or industrial uses, we find sites ripe for a change of use to mixed-use, mirroring the precedent. The low capital requirement is met by pursuing an option agreement rather than a direct purchase. This strategy is based on Pattern 5A and learnings about using "Distance to Train Station" as a proxy for PTAL outside London.

**Strengths:**
- Directly replicates the site characteristics of the successful planning precedent.
- Focuses on areas with existing infrastructure that can support densification.
- Capital-efficient through the use of option agreements.
- Identifies sites with clear planning uplift potential (from low-rise to 8-storey).
- A broad `Use class` filter captures a wide range of redevelopment opportunities.

**Limitations:**
- Does not guarantee the local planning policy supports tall buildings (requires manual verification).
- Competition may be high for well-located, under-developed sites.
- Success is dependent on negotiating an option agreement with the landowner.
- The landowner may already be aware of the site's development potential.
- Does not explicitly filter for seller motivation.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Execute the SearchLand query to identify target sites in Birmingham, Manchester, and Slough.
2.  For the top 5-10 sites in each city, conduct a desktop planning policy review to confirm if the area is designated for growth or tall buildings.
3.  Approach the owners of the most promising sites with a well-researched proposal for an option agreement.
4.  Offer a £50k-£100k non-refundable option fee for a 24-month period to secure planning permission.
5.  Once the option is secured, use the remaining capital to assemble a design team and submit a planning application that mirrors the successful 8-storey precedent.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee: £50,000 - £100,000
- Legal Fees (Option Agreement): £10,000
- Initial Architect & Planning Consultant Fees: £40,000
- Surveys (Topographical, Structural, Environmental): £25,000
- **Total:** £125,000 - £175,000

## Approach B: Capital-Efficient Airspace Development

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom
**Capital Required:** £75,000 - £150,000 (Airspace Rights & Legals)
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 18
3. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
7. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
8. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly addresses the £200k capital constraint by targeting airspace development, a strategy explicitly mentioned in the project requirements. It uses Pattern 6A to find existing low-to-mid-rise commercial buildings with flat roofs, which are prime candidates for adding multiple residential storeys. By focusing on freehold titles with few leases, it simplifies the complex legal negotiations required to secure airspace rights. This strategy is highly capital-efficient, as the primary cost is securing the rights, not purchasing the entire land and building. The location filter ensures these opportunities are in urban areas where density is viable.

**Strengths:**
- Highly capital-efficient, fitting well within the £200k budget.
- Utilizes existing building structures, potentially reducing construction costs and timelines.
- The underlying commercial use can provide income during the planning phase.
- Targets a specific, tangible asset (the roof) rather than abstract potential.
- Reduced site assembly risk as the building footprint is already defined.

**Limitations:**
- Requires specialist structural engineering advice to confirm the existing building can support additional floors.
- Negotiations with freeholders and existing tenants can be complex and protracted.
- Rights of light issues with neighbouring properties can be a significant constraint.
- The existing building's services (power, water, lifts) may need substantial upgrades.
- The pool of suitable buildings with willing owners is finite.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search in target geographies, focusing on London and other dense urban cores where airspace development is more common.
2.  Prioritize buildings with simple, large, flat roof structures and clear access.
3.  Engage a structural engineer for a preliminary desktop review of the most promising candidates.
4.  Approach the freehold owners with a direct offer to purchase the airspace rights, conditional on a successful structural survey.
5.  Negotiate a purchase price for the rights (£50k-£150k).
6.  Once rights are secured, proceed with a planning application for a multi-storey residential extension.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Airspace Rights Purchase: £75,000 - £150,000
- Legal Fees (Airspace & Title Split): £15,000
- Initial Structural Engineer & Architect Fees: £30,000
- **Total:** £120,000 - £195,000

---
## Approach C: Distressed Asset Acquisition (Forced Sale)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D: Liquidation/Administration Sales
**Capital Required:** £200,000 (Deposit for Subject-to-Planning Purchase)
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 3.0
4. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
6. NOT: Use class: is one of C3
7. Building on title is derelict: Yes
```

**Rationale:**
This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy focused on the strongest motivation signal available: a forced sale by a liquidator. Based on Pattern 2D and the critical insight from the `LEARNINGS_DATABASE`, this search targets companies in liquidation that own derelict, non-residential assets of a suitable size for major redevelopment. A liquidator's primary duty is to realize value for creditors, making them highly motivated to agree to a quick, certain deal. The £200k capital can be used as a significant deposit for a subject-to-planning purchase, offering the liquidator speed and certainty while managing the buyer's planning risk.

**Strengths:**
- Targets sellers with extreme motivation, creating a strong negotiating position.
- Potential to acquire sites at a significant discount to market value.
- Liquidators are professional and decisive, avoiding emotional seller negotiations.
- The derelict status provides a clear justification for demolition and redevelopment, aligning with the 8-storey precedent.
- Reduced competition as many developers are not set up for distressed opportunities.

**Limitations:**
- The number of available sites is very low.
- Properties may have significant legal, physical, or contamination issues.
- Liquidators often prefer unconditional cash offers, so a conditional bid must be compelling.
- Requires the ability to move very quickly on due diligence and legal matters.
- The process can be competitive if the asset is publicly marketed by the liquidator.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search across all target geographies. Due to the rarity of these sites, a wider net is necessary.
2.  Immediately engage legal counsel to review the title and administrator's documents for any identified site.
3.  Conduct rapid, high-level due diligence on planning, access, and potential contamination.
4.  Approach the liquidator with a clear, time-bound offer for a purchase conditional on planning permission, secured with a £200,000 non-refundable deposit.
5.  Emphasize speed and certainty as the key benefits of the offer.
6.  If the offer is accepted, use the exclusivity period to pursue a planning application for an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Deposit for Conditional Purchase: £200,000
- **Total:** £200,000

### Grok_Approaches

## Approach A: Precedent-Based 8-Storey Mixed-Use Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A: Similar planning approvals (8-storey mixed-use)

**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreements £10k-£50k, planning consultancy £20k-£50k, legal due diligence £20k-£50k)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (narrow focus on recent approvals)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "8-storey" AND "mixed-use"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
7. NOT: Flood zone 3
8. NOT: Conservation area
9. NOT: Listed building(s) in plot
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with recent planning approvals for similar 8-storey mixed-use developments (flexible retail ground floor with residential above), replicating the successful Slough/Birmingham/Manchester precedents. By focusing on approved schemes within the last 5 years, we identify proven development patterns with policy support for tall buildings and densification. The filters capture the key characteristics: substantial height (25-35m implied by 8 storeys), multi-unit residential (>20 dwellings), transport accessibility (<800m train), and compatible use classes (E commercial transitioning to residential). This precedent-based strategy derisks planning by demonstrating similar developments have been approved nearby.

**Strengths:**
- Planning derisked through precedent analysis
- Clear development template from approved schemes
- Policy support for tall buildings in urban areas
- Transport accessibility supports density requirements
- Narrow results focus on high-probability matches

**Limitations:**
- Limited to areas with recent 8-storey approvals (may miss emerging markets)
- Requires manual review of planning documents for exact scheme details
- Competition from other developers following same precedents
- May exclude sites with expired planning but resubmittable applications
- Geographic bias toward areas with tall building policies

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 10-30 sites with recent 8-storey mixed-use approvals
2. Manually review planning applications to confirm scheme details (retail ground + residential above, communal amenities)
3. Secure option agreements (£10k-£50k) with landowners for 12-24 month exclusivity
4. Engage planning consultant (£20k-£50k) to adapt precedent scheme to target site
5. Conduct legal due diligence (£20k-£50k) on title and planning conditions
6. Submit planning application using precedent evidence
7. Exit via sale to housebuilder or joint venture upon approval

## Approach B: Capital-Efficient Option Agreement Pipeline

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4B: Option agreement candidates

**Capital Required:** £30k-£120k (option deposits £10k-£50k, initial legal £10k-£30k, planning scoping £10k-£40k)

**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (broader pipeline for option farming)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Latest sold date: No latest sold date
2. Ownership type: is one of Private owner, Company
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
6. Freehold tenure
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. NOT: Flood zone 3
10. NOT: Conservation area
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets legacy holdings (never sold, indicating inherited or long-term family ownership) with inactive buildings and minimal recent planning activity, ideal for low-capital option agreements within the £200k budget. By focusing on sites with appropriate size (0.5-5 acres for 8-storey development), transport proximity (<1km train), and freehold tenure, we identify motivated sellers unaware of development potential. The inactive building filter suggests stalled or underutilized assets, while the "no latest sold date" captures legacy holdings where owners may be open to creative structures like options. This capital-efficient strategy allows securing multiple sites with minimal upfront commitment, creating a pipeline for planning applications contingent on option exercise.

**Strengths:**
- Very low initial capital (£10k-£50k per option) fits £200k budget
- Targets motivated legacy owners (inherited holdings, unaware value)
- Off-market approach avoids competition from active listings
- Flexible pipeline strategy (secure multiple options, pursue best)
- Freehold tenure simplifies development structure

**Limitations:**
- Requires strong negotiation skills for option agreements
- Owners may reject option terms (need planning contingency)
- Inactive buildings may have hidden condition issues
- Broader results require manual filtering for 8-storey suitability
- Time-intensive relationship building with private owners

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 20-50 legacy holdings with inactive buildings
2. Research ownership via Land Registry to identify private/family companies
3. Approach owners with option proposal (£10k-£50k deposit, 12-24 month term, planning-contingent)
4. Secure initial legal agreements (£10k-£30k) for option exclusivity
5. Conduct planning scoping (£10k-£40k) to assess 8-storey mixed-use feasibility
6. Exercise options on most promising sites (convert to full acquisition)
7. Develop planning applications using mixed-use template
8. Exit via sale to developer or joint venture upon planning approval

## Approach C: Airspace Intensification in Urban Transport Hubs

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, height headroom)

**Capital Required:** £80k-£180k (airspace rights negotiation £20k-£80k, structural assessment £10k-£30k, planning application £30k-£50k, legal £20k-£30k)

**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (urban focus with transport priority)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 3
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
6. Ownership type: is one of Private owner, Company
7. NOT: Flood zone 3
8. NOT: Conservation area
9. NOT: Listed building(s) in plot
10. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets existing buildings with flat roofs and height headroom (<15m current vs. 25-35m potential for 8 storeys) in high-transport-accessibility urban areas, enabling airspace development for mixed-use intensification. By focusing on commercial use classes (E) suitable for retail ground floors and transport proximity (<500m train station), we identify sites where adding residential storeys above creates substantial value. The flat roof filter ensures structural feasibility for extensions, while excluding green belt and conservation constraints maintains planning viability. This airspace strategy leverages existing infrastructure (utilities, access) while meeting the 8-storey height requirements through permitted development rights or planning approvals.

**Strengths:**
- Utilizes existing buildings and infrastructure (lower development costs)
- Flat roofs enable straightforward airspace extensions
- Transport proximity supports high-density residential above retail
- Commercial ground floor provides income during development
- Height headroom allows 4-6 additional storeys for 8-storey total

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural assessments to confirm load-bearing capacity
- Freeholder negotiation may be complex for airspace rights
- Urban focus may increase acquisition costs
- Planning approval needed for height increases beyond PDR limits
- Limited to buildings with actual flat roofs (not pitched/converted)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 15-40 urban sites with flat roofs and height potential
2. Conduct structural assessments (£10k-£30k) to confirm airspace capacity for 4-6 additional storeys
3. Negotiate airspace rights with freeholders (£20k-£80k) for development exclusivity
4. Engage planning consultant (£30k-£50k) for mixed-use intensification application
5. Secure legal agreements (£20k-£30k) for airspace development rights
6. Submit planning application for 8-storey mixed-use (retail ground + residential above)
7. Execute development or exit via sale to housebuilder with planning consent

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:
