**Targeted Search Angles**
- Seek vertically zoned transit nodes: Filter municipal GIS layers for parcels within 250 m of rapid transit stations already zoned MU (mixed-use) with 6–8 FSR allowances; target owners with expiring ground leases to leverage redevelopment fatigue and negotiate air-rights assemblies.  
- Leverage adaptive-reuse overlays: Compile inventories of under‑performing B-grade office blocks inside cultural heritage precincts where adaptive-reuse grants stack with density bonuses; model uplift by converting top floors to micro‑unit residential while retaining ground-floor retail.  
- Pursue community land-trust partnerships: Identify trust-held corner lots adjacent to new university expansions; structure 99-year leaseholds that deliver student housing on lower floors and subsidized lab/innovation suites above, tapping academic capital budgets for pre-commitment.
