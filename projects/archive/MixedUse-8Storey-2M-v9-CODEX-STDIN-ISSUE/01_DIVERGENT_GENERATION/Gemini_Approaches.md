## Approach A: The Precedent-Proxy Option

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) and Pattern 4B (Option Agreement Candidates)
**Capital Required:** £25,000 - £75,000 (Option Fee & Legal)
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.5
4. Ownership type: is one of Private owner, Company
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
6. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
7. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: is equal to 0
8. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets the implicit characteristics of the 8-storey mixed-use precedent. It searches for under-developed sites (low-rise buildings) in high-density-potential locations (near train stations). By filtering for sites that are off-market and have had no recent planning activity, it identifies passive owners who may be receptive to a low-capital option agreement (Pattern 4B). This strategy aims to secure development potential that mirrors a proven successful scheme, without requiring the capital for a direct purchase.

**Strengths:**
- Directly based on a successful planning precedent.
- Capital-efficient, using an option agreement to control a high-value site.
- Targets off-market properties, reducing competition.
- Strong policy argument for uplift due to proximity to transport infrastructure.
- Identifies passive owners who may be unaware of their site's full potential.

**Limitations:**
- Success is heavily dependent on negotiating an option agreement.
- Manual research is required to confirm local tall building policies.
- The owner may not be motivated to sell or enter an option.
- Higher planning risk than a site with existing consent.
- PTAL filter is London-only; this uses "Distance to Train Station" as a nationwide proxy.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Execute the search in target geographies (Birmingham, Manchester).
2.  For the resulting properties, conduct desktop due diligence on local planning policy to confirm support for densification/height.
3.  Identify the legal owner via Land Registry.
4.  Approach the owner directly with a well-researched proposal for a 12-24 month option agreement, contingent on achieving planning permission for an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.
5.  Once the option is secured, engage architects and planning consultants to develop and submit a planning application.
6.  Exit by selling the site with planning permission to a developer or by executing the option and developing in a Joint Venture.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee (1-3% of estimated land value): £20,000 - £60,000
- Legal Fees (for option agreement): £5,000 - £15,000
- **Total:** £25,000 - £75,000

## Approach B: The Airspace Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 6A (Airspace Development) and Pattern 14A (Inherited & Untouched Properties)
**Capital Required:** £60,000 - £170,000 (Airspace Rights & Legal)
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
4. No latest sold date: is equal to Yes
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
6. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
8. NOT: Listed building(s) in plot, Conservation area
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy focuses on creating value through airspace development, a highly capital-efficient method. It targets existing low-rise commercial buildings with flat roofs, suitable for adding multiple residential storeys. The key innovation is combining this physical characteristic with a strong motivation signal: "No latest sold date" (Pattern 14A). This identifies legacy properties, likely inherited by non-professional owners who are unaware of the significant value of their rooftop. This information asymmetry creates a prime opportunity to negotiate the purchase of the airspace rights at a favorable price.

**Strengths:**
- Very high potential ROI by creating developable "land" out of thin air.
- Low capital outlay focused on airspace rights, not the entire freehold.
- Targets a specific motivation angle (legacy owners) for higher negotiation success.
- Utilizes existing building structure and services, reducing ground-up development costs.
- The underlying commercial property provides income, making it attractive to the freeholder.

**Limitations:**
- Requires a structural survey to confirm the building can support additional floors.
- Negotiation with the freeholder can be complex.
- Rights of light issues with neighboring properties can be a constraint.
- Build costs for airspace are often higher per square metre than ground-up.
- "No latest sold date" is a rare filter, leading to a smaller pool of targets.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search in dense urban areas like London or Birmingham where height is valued.
2.  Research the identified properties to confirm single ownership and no obvious structural issues from the outside.
3.  Approach the private owner with an offer to purchase the "airspace rights" above their building.
4.  Frame the offer as a way for them to realize a significant cash windfall from an "unseen asset" without selling their property.
5.  Secure the rights for a fixed price, potentially with overage.
6.  Submit a planning application for a multi-storey residential extension.
7.  Exit by selling the consented airspace to a specialist developer or by developing it out.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Airspace Rights Purchase: £50,000 - £150,000
- Legal & Survey Fees: £10,000 - £20,000
- **Total:** £60,000 - £170,000

## Approach C: The Liquidation Land Grab

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales) combined with precedent site characteristics.
**Capital Required:** £100,000 - £200,000 (For deposit/securing the deal)
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.5
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Use class: is one of E, E(g)(iii), B2, B8, Unused land, Vacant/derelict land
6. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: is equal to 0
7. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:**
This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy focused on acquiring land at a significant discount from a highly motivated seller. It uses the powerful "Company status: Liquidation" filter (Pattern 2D) to find companies legally obligated to sell assets quickly. This search is layered with the core requirements of the precedent project: a suitably sized plot in a good location. By adding "Building on title is derelict," it doubles down on motivation, targeting non-performing assets that are a drain on the liquidator's resources. The goal is to acquire the land at a price that makes a £2M profit achievable, even with a low initial capital outlay used to secure the deal before potentially flipping it.

**Strengths:**
- Targets the strongest possible motivation signal: a forced sale.
- Potential to acquire land significantly below market value.
- Creates a strong negotiating position for the buyer.
- Liquidators prioritize speed and certainty, which a cash-ready buyer can offer.
- Derelict status strengthens the argument for demolition and comprehensive redevelopment.

**Limitations:**
- Very small pool of opportunities at any given time.
- Properties may have significant legal, physical, or contamination issues.
- Competition from other distressed asset funds and opportunistic buyers.
- Requires the ability to transact very quickly (cash or pre-arranged finance is critical).
- The £200k capital may only be enough to get the deal under contract before needing to bring in a funding partner.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search across all target geographies and monitor it daily for new opportunities.
2.  When a property is identified, immediately contact the listed administrator/liquidator.
3.  Perform rapid, high-level due diligence on planning, title, and constraints.
4.  Make a clean, non-contingent offer with a rapid completion timeline, using the £200k as a deposit to show proof of funds.
5.  Emphasize speed and certainty to the liquidator.
6.  Once the deal is under contract, either secure development finance to build out the 8-storey scheme or flip the contract/site to a large developer for a significant profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Deal Deposit (10% of discounted price): £50,000 - £150,000
- Legal & Due Diligence Costs: £10,000 - £25,000
- Working Capital: £40,000 - £25,000
- **Total:** £100,000 - £200,000
