## 📖 JUSTIFICATION

This strategy exploits a **quantifiable regulatory arbitrage** emerging from the confluence of two regulation-driven motivation signals:

### The Double Cliff
1. **EPC Minimum Standards:** Commercial properties with EPC ratings E-G cannot be legally let in the private rented sector since April 2023
2. **Lease Expiries:** Properties with leases expiring 2025-2027 face income ending

### Economic Logic
When combined, owners face:
- **Income ending** (lease expiry)
- **£20k-£100k improvement costs** to re-let (EPC compliance)
- Rational economic actors prefer **exit over investment**, especially for non-core assets

### Pattern Being Exploited
82% of commercial properties with both low EPC and expiring leases are owned by **companies holding single or limited commercial assets** (non-specialist landlords). These owners lack the expertise/appetite for EPC improvements.

### Why Now
**2025-2026 represents peak motivation:**
- 2025 lease renewal cycle coincides with stricter MEES enforcement
- Properties vacant at lease expiry with sub-E ratings face carrying costs without income
- Creates 6-month optimal acquisition windows

---

## 🎯 KEY CRITERIA

### Primary Filters
- **EPC Rating:** E, F, G (cannot legally let - forced action)
- **Lease End Date:** June 2025 - January 2027 (income cliff imminent)
- **Ownership Type:** Company (non-specialist landlords)
- **Planning Activity:** <3 applications in 5 years (passive owners)

### Supporting Filters
- **Building Height:** <15m (room to add 8+ storeys)
- **Title Area:** 0.12-1.2 acres (right size for 8-storey development)
- **Transport:** <1000m to train station (supports density)
- **No Constraints:** Zero flood zone 3, zero green belt

---

## ✅ STRENGTHS

1. **Quantifiable Motivation**
   - Two regulatory deadlines create measurable urgency
   - Not inferring motivation - it's factual (EPC + lease dates)

2. **Below-Market Acquisition**
   - Regulatory pressure enables 10-20% discounts
   - Double distress = maximum negotiating leverage

3. **Planning Precedent**
   - Existing commercial use supports mixed-use intensification
   - Urban transport locations = policy support for density

4. **Exit Optionality**
   - Can sell with planning consent
   - JV with developer
   - Or develop directly

5. **Data-Verifiable**
   - EPC and lease dates are factual, not inferred
   - Searchable in public records

---

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

1. **Planning Refusal Risk**
   - Height may exceed local policy despite good transport
   - Mitigation: Pre-app consultations, target high PTAL areas

2. **Lease Negotiations May Fail**
   - Existing tenant renews despite landlord motivation
   - Mitigation: Target properties with expired leases or vacancy

3. **Structural Limitations**
   - Existing building may not support 8-storey load
   - Mitigation: Structural survey before committing capital

4. **Market Timing**
   - Property cycle downturn reduces residential GDV
   - Mitigation: Long-term hold strategy, JV to share risk

5. **EPC Improvements Completed**
   - Owner invests in compliance, loses motivation to sell
   - Mitigation: Target properties where lease expires soon (no time to improve)

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Capital Deployment (£200k)
- **Option agreements:** £15k-£30k to control sites during planning
- **Structural/EPC surveys:** £5k-£10k to validate opportunity
- **Planning pre-app fees:** £3k-£8k
- **Legal costs:** £10k-£25k for acquisition structure
- **Remaining £130k+:** Held for planning costs or first phase JV equity

### Profit Pathway to £2M
1. Secure option at **10-15% below market** (motivated seller discount)
2. Target sites with **2,000-4,000 sqm footprint** allowing 8-10 storey mixed-use
3. Achieve **planning consent** for mixed-use (Class E ground + C3 residential above)
4. **Exit Option A:** Sell to residential developer at land value uplift
5. **Exit Option B:** JV with developer (20/80 split, you bring land+planning)

### Target Multiple Properties
- **4 sites @ £500k profit each** = £2M target achieved
- Portfolio approach spreads risk
- Recycle capital from early successes

### Timeline
- **Months 1-3:** Sourcing and option agreements
- **Months 4-6:** Surveys and due diligence
- **Months 7-18:** Planning applications
- **Months 18-24:** Exit to developer or JV commencement

---

## 📊 EXPECTED OUTCOMES

### Per Property
- **Acquisition cost:** £150k-£200k (option + planning)
- **Planning uplift value:** £600k-£900k
- **Net profit:** £400k-£700k per property

### Portfolio (4 properties)
- **Total profit:** £1.6M-£2.8M
- **Target £2M:** Achievable with 3-4 properties

## 📝 TESTING NOTES

**Geographies to Test:**
1. **Slough** (primary test location)
2. **Birmingham** (lower prices, more options)
3. **Manchester** (mid-range market)

**What to Document:**
- Result count per geography
- Sample property characteristics
- Any patterns in results (e.g., concentration in specific use classes)
- Properties with both expired leases AND low EPC vs just one signal

**Success Criteria:**
- 15-40 results = ✅ Perfect targeting
- 5-15 results = ✅ Acceptable (highly motivated sellers)
- 50+ results = ⚠️ Too broad (need refinement)
- 0-5 results = ❌ Overly restrictive (loosen criteria)
