## 📖 JUSTIFICATION

### Unconventional Angle
This strategy stacks **two independent distress signals** that rarely coincide - corporate liquidation (forced sale) with stalled planning (work already done). When both occur together, pricing falls to **20-40% of underlying value** while planning permission provides immediate uplift.

### Why Others Miss It
Liquidators work on tight timelines (3-6 months) and prefer cash buyers. Most developers:

1. **Avoid "problem" assets** without examining planning history
2. **Don't have cash readily available** for distressed timelines
3. **Miss that stalled planning = value created but unrealized**
4. **Don't know to combine** company status with planning filters

This filtering combination is unconventional - most use either liquidation OR planning, not both.

### Creative Structure
The £200k positions you as a **cash buyer** (liquidators prize speed/certainty):

**Option A:** Purchase distressed asset at 30-40% discount, revive stalled planning through Section 73 variation or fresh application, exit to developer

**Option B:** Option agreement with liquidator (unusual but possible - they want certainty of exit)

**Key Insight:** The planning work is already done (£50k-£200k sunk cost). You're acquiring it for free at the distressed price.

## 🎯 KEY CRITERIA

### Primary Filters
- **Company Ownership:** Yes
- **Company Status:** Liquidation (forced sale, legal obligation)
- **Planning History:** Application submitted 2019+ (recent enough to be relevant)
- **Development Scale:** >5 dwellings applied for (substantial opportunity)
- **Building Inactive:** Yes (vacant = no tenant complications)

### Supporting Filters
- **Planning Activity:** >0 applications in 5 years (planning work done)
- **Title Area:** 0.15-1.5 acres (right size for 8-storey development)
- **Transport:** <1000m to train (supports residential density)

### Constraints
- Zero flood zone 3 (avoid insurance complications)
- Zero green belt (avoid policy constraints)

---

## ✅ STRENGTHS

1. **Dual Motivation = Maximum Discount**
   - Liquidation = forced sale (legal obligation)
   - Stalled planning = sunk cost, unrealized value
   - Combined = 30-50% discount vs market

2. **Planning Work Already Completed**
   - Previous owner spent £50k-£200k on planning
   - You acquire precedent value for free
   - Architectural designs, surveys, feasibility studies included

3. **Liquidators Prefer Cash Buyers**
   - Speed and certainty valued over price
   - Your £200k cash = competitive advantage
   - No financing contingency = attractive offer

4. **Clear Decision-Maker**
   - Liquidator has authority (not board/shareholders)
   - Can make quick decisions (3-6 month timeline)
   - No emotional attachment to property

5. **Short Negotiation Timeline**
   - Liquidators can't delay (legal obligations)
   - Pressure to close quickly benefits buyer
   - Less time for competing bids to emerge

---

## ⚠️ LIMITATIONS

1. **Planning Genuinely Undeliverable**
   - Original refusal may have been for valid reasons
   - **Mitigation:** Review planning history, officer reports thoroughly
   - Understand why planning stalled before committing

2. **Liquidator Already Has Buyer**
   - May be in advanced negotiations with another party
   - **Mitigation:** Speed of approach (monitor Companies House liquidations)
   - Be first to contact liquidator

3. **Hidden Liabilities**
   - Site may have contamination, party wall issues, unresolved contracts
   - **Mitigation:** Asset purchase (not share purchase) - avoids company liabilities
   - Comprehensive due diligence before completion

4. **Site Contamination**
   - Industrial/commercial sites may have environmental issues
   - **Mitigation:** Environmental due diligence in legal DD phase
   - Phase 1 survey essential

5. **Small Pool of Opportunities**
   - Very targeted filter = limited properties
   - **Mitigation:** UK-wide search, monitor liquidations monthly
   - Be patient, wait for right opportunity

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

### Capital Deployment (Direct Purchase: £180k-£285k)
- **Site acquisition:** £120k-£180k (distressed price, 30-50% of £400k-£600k value)
- **Legal due diligence:** £15k-£25k (environmental, title, planning review)
- **Planning revival:** £20k-£40k (Section 73 or fresh application)
- **Professional fees:** £10k-£20k (architect, planning consultant)
- **Contingency:** £15k-£20k (10% buffer for unknowns)

### Alternative: Option Structure (£60k-£120k)
- **Option agreement:** £20k-£50k (liquidator may accept for certainty)
- **Legal/DD:** £10k-£15k (essential due diligence)
- **Planning revival:** £20k-£40k (revive/extend/vary)
- **Contingency:** £10k-£15k
- **Lower entry, higher risk** (liquidator may sell to another buyer)

### Profit Pathway to £2M

**Exit 1: Sale at Planning Consent**
- Acquisition (distressed): £150k
- Planning revival: £40k
- Total investment: £190k
- Consented site value: £600k-£900k (8-15 units @ £75k-£100k per plot)
- **Net profit:** £410k-£710k (2-4x ROI)
- **Need:** 3-4 properties to hit £2M

**Exit 2: JV Through Construction**
- Acquisition: £150k
- Planning revival: £40k
- Total investment: £190k
- GDV (8 units @ £250k avg): £2M
- Construction costs: £960k (£120k/unit)
- Finance: £150k
- Gross profit: £700k
- **JV split (50%):** Your share = £350k
- **Need:** 6 properties OR combine with Exit 1

**Hybrid Strategy (RECOMMENDED):**
- 2 properties via Exit 1: £1.2M-£1.4M profit
- 2 properties via Exit 2: £700k profit
- **Total:** £1.9M-£2.1M

### Timeline
- **Month 1:** Monitor Companies House for liquidations, identify targets
- **Months 2-3:** Contact liquidators, negotiate, DD
- **Month 3-4:** Complete acquisition
- **Months 5-12:** Planning revival/variation
- **Month 12-18:** Exit at consent OR JV commencement

## 📝 TESTING NOTES

**Geographies to Test:**
- **UK-wide** (not geography-specific due to rarity)
- Focus on urban areas with development activity

**What to Document:**
- Total count of liquidation + planning properties
- Common reasons for planning stall (understand patterns)
- Age of planning applications (how recent?)
- Development scale (unit counts)

**Success Criteria:**
- 5-15 results = ✅ Perfect (highly targeted, high value)
- 2-5 results = ✅ Acceptable (rare but viable)
- 15+ results = ⚠️ Surprising (validate quality)
- 0-2 results = ❌ Too restrictive (widen date range or dwelling threshold)

**Key Validation:**
- Why did companies enter liquidation? (construction finance failure vs planning failure)
- Is planning genuinely revivable? (check refusal reasons)
- Are liquidators accessible? (contact details available)
