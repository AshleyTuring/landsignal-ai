## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Choose an Approach
Open any of the 4 files above

### Step 2: Copy SearchLand AI Prompt
Each file has a section labeled "🤖 SEARCHLAND AI PROMPT"  
Copy the numbered list (1. Filter name: operator value...)

### Step 3: Paste into SearchLand
1. Go to SearchLand.co.uk
2. Click on "AI Chat" or filter builder
3. Paste the criteria
4. Select geography (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester)

### Step 4: Document Results
For each approach, note:
- Result count
- Quality of results (are they genuinely what we're looking for?)
- Sample properties (2-3 examples)
- Observations (any patterns?)

### Step 5: Compare Approaches
After testing all 4, determine:
- Which got best results?
- Which are worth pursuing?
- Any unexpected learnings?

## 📊 Success Criteria

| Result Count | Assessment | Action |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| 0-5 | ❌ Too restrictive | Loosen criteria or try different geography |
| 5-15 | ✅ Highly targeted | Perfect for narrow strategies (D, E) |
| 15-40 | ✅ Ideal | Perfect for moderate strategies (A, C) |
| 40-100 | ⚠️ Broad | Review quality, may need refinement |
| 100+ | ❌ Too broad | Tighten criteria |
