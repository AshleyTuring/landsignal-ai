# Comparative Analysis: All Tested Approaches

**Project:** [PROJECT_NAME]
**Date:** [DATE]
**Approaches Tested:** [List]

## Results Summary

| Approach | [LPA1] | [LPA2] | [LPA3] | UK-Wide Est. | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| [X]: [Name] | [count] | [count] | [count] | [estimate] | [TOO RESTRICTIVE/OPTIMAL/TOO BROAD] |
| [X]: [Name] | [count] | [count] | [count] | [estimate] | [Status] |
| [X]: [Name] | [count] | [count] | [count] | [estimate] | [Status] |

**Result Count Interpretation:**
- **0-10:** TOO RESTRICTIVE (may need refinement)
- **10-50:** OPTIMAL (targeted search)
- **50-200:** GOOD (broader search, more screening required)
- **200+:** TOO BROAD (needs narrowing)

## Winner: Approach [X] - [Name]

**Why This Approach Won:**
- Result count: [X] properties in target LPA (optimal range)
- Geographic consistency: [performs across multiple markets / London-specific / etc.]
- Capital alignment: [fits budget / requires creative structure]
- Profit pathway: [clear route to target profit]
- Quality of results: [properties match requirements well]

**Sample Properties from Winner:**
1. [Brief description of property 1]
2. [Brief description of property 2]
3. [Brief description of property 3]

**Next Steps:**
1. Export full results from SearchLand
2. Proceed to Stage 5: Site Validation
3. Screen properties against ValidationCriteria.md
4. Deep research on top 3-5 candidates

## Runner-Up: Approach [X] - [Name]

**Why Runner-Up:**
- [Slightly fewer results / different property profile / backup strategy / etc.]

**Use Case:**
[When would you use this instead of the winner?]

---

## Failed Approaches

### Approach [X]: [Name] - TOO RESTRICTIVE
- **Result count:** [0-5 across all LPAs]
- **Issue:** [Identify specific filter(s) causing excessive restriction]
- **Learning:** [What did we discover? Update LEARNINGS_DATABASE?]
- **Refinement Potential:** [Can this be fixed? How?]

### Approach [X]: [Name] - TOO BROAD
- **Result count:** [500+ across all LPAs]
- **Issue:** [Not targeted enough / missing key filters]
- **Refinement Potential:** [Add what constraints?]

## Geographic Insights

**Market Variations:**
- **[LPA1] characteristics:** [e.g., Higher prices, fewer derelict sites]
- **[LPA2] characteristics:** [e.g., More corporate ownership, stalled developments]
- **[LPA3] characteristics:** [e.g., Lower prices, more options at budget]

**Filter Performance by Geography:**
| Filter/Strategy | London | Midlands | North | Scotland |
|----------------|--------|----------|-------|----------|
| PTAL filters | Works | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| £200k price cap | 0 results | Few | Moderate | Better |
| Derelict status | Rare | Moderate | Common | Common |

## Profit Pathway Validation

**Can target profit be achieved?**

**Approach [X] (Winner):**
- Typical acquisition: £[X]
- Planning/build costs: £[X]
- Target GDV: £[X]
- **Projected profit:** £[X]
- **Achieves goal:** [Yes / No / Marginal]

## Refinement Recommendations

### High Priority (Do Now):
1. **Refine Approach [X]:** [Specific changes] → Retest
2. **Test Approach [X] variant:** [What variation to try?]

### Medium Priority (Consider):
1. **Geographic focus:** [Should we focus on specific regions?]
2. **Capital model shift:** [Should we pivot strategy?]

### Low Priority (Future):
1. [Ideas for future exploration]
