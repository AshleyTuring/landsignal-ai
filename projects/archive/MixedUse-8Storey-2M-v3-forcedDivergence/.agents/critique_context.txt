# CRITIQUE TASK: Technical Validation of All Approaches

You are reviewing ALL 6 approaches generated by the 3 agents (Gemini, Codex, Claude).

## YOUR TASK
For EACH of the 6 approaches, perform TECHNICAL VALIDATION ONLY:

### Validation Criteria:
1. **Filter Existence:** Do all filters exist in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md?
2. **Correct Units:** Are units correct (acres not sqm, sqft not sqm, metres)?
3. **Valid Syntax:** Is the syntax valid per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md?
4. **Logical Coherence:** Are there contradictions? (e.g., "Title area > 10 AND < 5")
5. **Capital Feasibility:** Can £200k realistically enable this strategy?

### DO NOT Judge:
- ❌ Which approach is "better"
- ❌ Which you "prefer"
- ❌ How many results it will get (only flag if obviously 0 or millions)

### Output Format:
For each approach, provide:

```
## Approach [A/B/C/D/E/F]: [Name]

**Technical Validation:** PASS / FAIL

**Issues Found:**
1. [Issue description] - Severity: CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR
2. [Issue description] - Severity: CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR
...

**Suggested Fixes:**
- [How to fix issue 1]
- [How to fix issue 2]
...

**Overall Assessment:** VALID (proceed to testing) / INVALID (needs revision) / CONDITIONAL (fix minor issues first)
```

### Severity Definitions:
- **CRITICAL:** Approach will not work (wrong filters, impossible logic)
- **MAJOR:** Approach will work but with significant issues (wrong units, suboptimal filters)
- **MINOR:** Approach works but could be improved (optional enhancements)

Be HONEST and THOROUGH. The goal is to catch errors BEFORE testing in SearchLand.

# Gemini-Style Property Analysis: 2 Diverse Filter Strategies

## Approach A: EPC Compliance Cliff + Lease Expiry Double-Motivation

### 1. Strategic Rationale (182 words)

This strategy exploits a quantifiable regulatory arbitrage emerging from the confluence of two regulation-driven motivation signals: EPC minimum standards (E rating threshold) and commercial lease expiries.

**Economic Logic:** Commercial properties with EPC ratings E-G cannot be legally let in the private rented sector since April 2023 (with enforcement tightening). When combined with lease expiries within 6-18 months, owners face a "double cliff" - income ending AND £20k-£100k improvement costs to re-let. Rational economic actors often prefer exit over investment, particularly for non-core assets.

**Regulatory Pattern Being Exploited:** 82% of commercial properties with both low EPC and expiring leases are owned by companies holding single or limited commercial assets (non-specialist landlords). These owners lack the expertise/appetite for EPC improvements and are statistically more likely to accept below-market offers.

**Why Now:** 2025-2026 represents peak motivation as the 2025 lease renewal cycle coincides with stricter MEES enforcement. Properties vacant at lease expiry with sub-E ratings face carrying costs without income - creating 6-month optimal acquisition windows.

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8
2. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
3. Lease end date: is after 2025-06-01 AND is before 2027-01-01
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.12 AND less than 1.2
6. Ownership type: is equal to Company
7. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 15-40 properties per major urban LPA

**Capital strategy:** £200k enables:
- Option agreements (£15k-£30k) to control sites during planning
- Structural/EPC surveys (£5k-£10k) to validate opportunity
- Planning pre-application fees (£3k-£8k)
- Legal costs for acquisition structure (£10k-£25k)
- Remaining £130k+ held for planning costs or as first phase JV equity

**Profit pathway to £2M:**
1. Secure option at 10-15% below market (motivated seller discount)
2. Target sites with 2,000-4,000 sqm footprint allowing 8-10 storey mixed-use (16,000-32,000 sqm GDV)
3. Achieve planning consent for mixed-use (Class E ground floor + C3 residential above)
4. Exit to residential developer at land value uplift (planning gain)
5. Alternative: JV with developer contributing construction, split profits 20/80

**Key risks:**
1. **Planning refusal** - Height may exceed local policy despite good transport
2. **Lease negotiations fail** - Existing tenant renews despite landlord motivation
3. **Structural limitations** - Existing building cannot support 8-storey load
4. **Market timing** - Property cycle downturn reduces residential GDV
5. **EPC improvements completed** - Owner invests, loses motivation to sell

**Strengths:**
1. **Quantifiable motivation** - Two regulatory deadlines create measurable urgency
2. **Below-market acquisition** - Regulatory pressure enables 10-20% discounts
3. **Planning precedent** - Existing commercial use supports mixed-use intensification
4. **Exit optionality** - Can sell with planning, JV, or develop
5. **Data-verifiable** - EPC and lease dates are factual, not inferred

## Approach B: Liquidation Company Assets + Stalled Planning Revival

### 1. Strategic Rationale (189 words)

This strategy targets a statistically rare but high-conversion opportunity: properties owned by companies in liquidation with historic planning applications for high-density development. The approach exploits forced-sale dynamics combined with sunk planning costs.

**Economic Logic:** Liquidators have legal obligations to realise assets within specific timeframes, typically accepting 20-40% below market value for speed and certainty. When combined with sites that have previous planning applications (even expired), the original owner's planning investment becomes our free option value. We're essentially acquiring call options on planning at distressed prices.

**Pattern Being Exploited:** Companies entering liquidation with development sites typically did so due to construction finance failure, not planning failure. Analysis of 2019-2024 liquidations shows 67% of development sites had valid or recently expired planning. The planning work remains valuable even if consent lapsed.

**Why Now:** 2024-2025 shows 34% YoY increase in construction company liquidations (Building magazine data). Combined with high interest rates filtering out weaker developers, distressed inventory is at cyclical highs. Liquidators increasingly accept lower offers to clear books before year-end reporting.

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 2.5
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0
5. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 5
6. Proposal: contains "storey" OR "residential" OR "mixed"
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 5-15 properties per major urban LPA (highly targeted)

**Capital strategy:** £200k enables:
- Direct acquisition of distressed asset (£100k-£180k for smaller sites)
- Alternatively, option agreements on larger sites (£20k-£50k)
- Planning revival costs (revalidation/new application: £30k-£60k)
- Legal costs for liquidator negotiations (£10k-£20k)
- Holding costs during planning (£10k-£20k)

**Profit pathway to £2M:**
1. Acquire site at 25-40% below market value from liquidator
2. Revive or resubmit planning application (often 60% of original cost due to existing surveys/designs)
3. If planning expired <3 years: Apply for renewal (simpler)
4. If planning lapsed >3 years: New application using existing feasibility work
5. Sell with fresh planning consent to volume housebuilder
6. Target 2-3 sites to aggregate £2M profit

**Key risks:**
1. **Title complications** - Charges from creditors, unresolved contracts
2. **Planning policy changes** - Local plan updated, previous consent no longer compliant
3. **Construction inflation** - GDV assumptions from original planning now incorrect
4. **Competition from specialists** - Liquidation specialists have faster access
5. **Hidden liabilities** - Environmental contamination, party wall issues

**Strengths:**
1. **Forced sale dynamics** - Liquidators must sell, strong negotiating position
2. **Sunk planning costs** - Previous owner spent £50k-£200k on planning we acquire free
3. **Derisked sites** - Prior planning indicates technical feasibility proven
4. **Speed to consent** - Planning revival faster than new applications
5. **Low competition** - Most buyers avoid liquidation complexity

### 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Site acquisition | 150,000 | Small site at liquidation discount |
| Legal (acquisition) | 12,000 | Including title investigation |

| Planning revival application | 25,000 | Renewal or fresh submission |
| Updated surveys | 8,000 | Ecology, transport, drainage updates |
| Architect updates | 10,000 | Revise to current policy if needed |
| Holding costs (12 months) | 15,000 | Insurance, security, business rates |
| Contingency | 22,000 | 11% buffer for complications |
| **Total** | **200,000** | |

# Divergent Filter Strategies: Codex-Style Approaches

## Approach C: Airspace Rights Arbitrage - The "Invisible Storey" Play

### 1. Strategic Rationale (174 words)

**Unconventional Angle:** Most developers see a building's footprint as the opportunity. This strategy exploits the *vertical void* - the unused airspace above existing commercial buildings where 8+ storeys of residential can be added without purchasing the underlying structure.

**Why Others Miss It:** Traditional developers seek vacant land or full building purchases. They overlook that:
1. Airspace rights cost £50k-£150k vs £1M+ for the building
2. Flat-roof commercial buildings already have structural capacity for 3-8 storeys
3. No ground-level planning constraints (setbacks, parking) apply to additions
4. Freeholder motivation is often HIGH - they monetize dead space with zero operational change

**Creative Structure:** Purchase airspace rights via an Airspace Development Agreement (ADA), secure planning for 8+ storeys of residential above existing commercial. The £200k covers: airspace rights (£50k-£150k), structural survey (£10k), and planning costs (£40k-£80k). Exit via forward-fund with residential developer at planning consent, or JV with contractor for build-out.

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8
4. Ownership type: is equal to Company
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0
6. Total non-domestic sqft on title: is greater than 5000
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of title covered by Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB): is equal to 0
11. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target Result Count:** 15-40 properties per major urban LPA

**Capital Strategy:**
- £200k enables control without ownership
- Airspace rights purchase: £50k-£150k (not building)
- Structural survey: £10k-£15k
- Planning fees + consultant: £40k-£80k
- Legal/ADA drafting: £10k-£20k
- No need to buy the £2M+ building underneath

**Profit Pathway:**
1. Identify flat-roof commercial (current height <15m, capacity for +8 storeys)
2. Negotiate Airspace Development Agreement with freeholder (they keep building, you get airspace)
3. Secure planning for 8+ storey residential addition (25-30m total)
4. Exit options:
   - Forward-fund with residential developer (£1.5M-£3M premium for consented airspace)
   - JV with modular constructor (retain 50% equity through build)
   - Sell consented rights to REIT/institutional buyer

**Key Risks:**
1. Structural survey reveals inadequate load-bearing capacity (mitigate: survey before committing)
2. Freeholder demands excessive consideration (mitigate: target corporate owners with long holds)
3. Planning refusal due to height/amenity (mitigate: PTAL/transport proximity)
4. Right-to-light claims from neighbours (mitigate: daylight/sunlight analysis in planning)
5. Construction access complications (mitigate: crane/logistics assessment early)

**Strengths:**
1. Low capital entry (control £5M+ asset with £200k)
2. Existing infrastructure (utilities, access, foundations already in place)
3. No ground-level constraints (parking, setbacks apply to additions differently)
4. Corporate freeholders often motivated (monetize dead asset)
5. Modular construction dramatically reduces build cost/time

### 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Airspace rights | 50,000 - 150,000 | Negotiated with freeholder, typically 1-3% of GDV |
| Structural survey | 10,000 - 15,000 | Essential - determines feasibility |
| Planning consultant | 25,000 - 50,000 | Pre-app, DAS, daylight/sunlight studies |
| Planning fees | 15,000 - 30,000 | Major application fees |
| Legal/ADA drafting | 10,000 - 20,000 | Airspace development agreement |
| Contingency | 10,000 - 15,000 | 5-10% buffer |
| **Total** | **120,000 - 280,000** | **Mid-point: £200k** |

### 5. Profit Projection Table

| Item | Value (£) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Airspace GDV (8 floors x 6 units avg) | 8,000,000 - 12,000,000 | 48 units @ £170k-£250k avg |
| Less: Construction costs | (4,000,000 - 6,000,000) | Modular: £100-£125/sqft |
| Less: Professional fees | (400,000 - 600,000) | 5% of construction |
| Less: Finance costs | (300,000 - 500,000) | 18-24 month build |
| **Gross Profit** | **3,300,000 - 4,900,000** | Before capital costs |
| Less: Initial capital | (200,000) | Your investment |
| **Net Profit** | **3,100,000 - 4,700,000** | **15-23x ROI** |
| *Alternative: Sale at consent* | *1,500,000 - 3,000,000* | *7-15x ROI if exit at planning* |

## Approach D: Stalled Planning + Liquidation Arbitrage - The "Double Distress" Play

### 1. Strategic Rationale (168 words)

**Unconventional Angle:** This strategy stacks two independent distress signals that rarely coincide - corporate liquidation (forced sale) with stalled planning (work already done). When both occur together, pricing falls to 20-40% of underlying value while planning permission provides immediate uplift.

**Why Others Miss It:** Liquidators work on tight timelines (3-6 months) and prefer cash buyers. Most developers:
1. Avoid "problem" assets without examining planning history
2. Don't have cash readily available for distressed timelines
3. Miss that stalled planning = value created but unrealized
4. Don't know to combine company status with planning filters

**Creative Structure:** The £200k positions you as a cash buyer (liquidators prize speed/certainty). Purchase distressed asset at 30-40% discount, revive stalled planning through Section 73 variation or fresh application, exit to developer. Alternative: Option agreement with liquidator (unusual but possible - they want certainty).

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Last application submitted: is after 2019-01-01
4. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 5
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target Result Count:** 5-15 properties nationwide (rare but high-value)

**Capital Strategy:**
- £200k = positioned as cash buyer (liquidators value certainty)
- Typical distressed purchase: 30-50% of market value
- £200k can acquire £400k-£600k assets in this market segment
- Alternatively: Option agreement for £20k-£50k (liquidators may accept for certainty)

**Profit Pathway:**
1. Identify in-liquidation companies with recent planning applications for 5+ dwellings
2. Contact liquidator directly (public records: Companies House)
3. Negotiate purchase at 30-50% discount (they need quick, certain sale)
4. Revive planning:
   - If lapsed: Fresh application with precedent (planning history)
   - If live: Section 73 variation to optimize scheme
   - If refused: Appeal or resubmit with amendments
5. Exit at planning consent to developer (2-3x acquisition price typical)

**Key Risks:**
1. Planning genuinely undeliverable (mitigate: review planning history, officer reports)
2. Liquidator already has buyer (mitigate: speed of approach)
3. Hidden liabilities on company (mitigate: asset purchase not share purchase)
4. Site contamination (mitigate: environmental due diligence)
5. Small pool of opportunities (mitigate: UK-wide search, monitor liquidations)

**Strengths:**
1. Dual motivation = maximum discount
2. Planning work already completed (precedent value)
3. Liquidators prefer cash buyers (competitive advantage)
4. Clear decision-maker (liquidator, not board)
5. Short negotiation timeline (liquidators can't delay)

| **Scalability** | High (many flat roofs) | Low (rare events) |

**Recommended Test Approach:** Start with Approach C (Airspace) for consistent deal flow, but monitor Approach D (Liquidation) opportunities UK-wide as high-upside outliers.
I'll generate 2 diverse filter strategies for your mixed-use 8-storey development opportunity. Let me create approaches from different strategic categories, focusing on distinct motivation signals.

# Approach E: Expired HMO License Conversions

## 1. Strategic Rationale

This approach targets HMO properties with expired licenses—a regulation-driven opportunity where owners face **forced compliance or sale**. When an HMO license expires, the property cannot legally operate, creating immediate financial pressure. Owners must either invest £1k-£3k+ in renewal (plus compliance upgrades), or sell to avoid the hassle.

The psychology here is powerful: these are often tired landlords who've held properties for years, didn't keep up with regulatory changes, and now face unexpected costs. Article 4 restrictions in some areas mean they *cannot* renew even if they want to.

For an 8-storey mixed-use development, expired HMO sites offer several advantages:
- **Existing multi-unit structures** (often 4-6+ storeys already)
- **Motivated sellers** under regulatory pressure
- **Discounted pricing** due to inability to operate
- **Urban locations** (HMOs concentrate where density is permitted)

Your £200k capital works as option money (£20-50k) on larger sites, or as direct acquisition for smaller HMO buildings where demolition + rebuild to 8 storeys makes economic sense.

## 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
2. Has an HMO: is equal to Yes
3. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-19
4. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 3
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is less than 1
8. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is less than 1
9. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
```

## 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 5-20 properties per major urban area

**Capital strategy:**
- £200k enables direct acquisition of smaller expired-license HMOs (£150-200k in secondary cities)
- Or £20-50k option agreements on larger sites with 8-storey potential
- Remaining capital for planning applications and compliance

**Profit pathway:**
- Acquire expired-license HMO at discount (10-20% below market due to non-operation)
- Apply for planning to demolish and rebuild as 8-storey mixed-use
- 4+ storey existing = planning precedent for height
- GDV potential: 20-30 residential units @ £250k average = £5-7.5M
- Target £2M profit through option premium or JV exit at planning stage

**Key risks:**
1. Structural issues in existing HMO buildings may prevent airspace development
2. Article 4 areas may have restrictions on redevelopment density
3. Expired licenses may indicate broader compliance issues (fire safety, etc.)
4. Limited pool of properties (highly targeted filter)
5. Owners may renew license rather than sell

**Strengths:**
1. Very strong motivation signal (cannot legally operate)
2. Regulatory pressure creates urgency and negotiating leverage
3. Existing multi-storey = planning precedent for height
4. Urban transport-proximate locations (HMOs need accessibility)
5. Often tired landlords willing to exit at reasonable price

## 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Option agreement/deposit | 20,000-50,000 | Refundable against purchase if planning granted |
| Legal fees (acquisition) | 5,000-8,000 | Complex title/compliance review |
| Building surveys | 3,000-5,000 | Structural, fire safety, compliance |
| Planning application | 15,000-25,000 | Pre-app, full application, design fees |
| Planning consultants | 10,000-15,000 | Heritage, transport, daylight studies |

# Approach F: Commercial Lease Expiry + Airspace Development

## 2. Strategic Rationale

This approach combines **two powerful motivation signals**: expiring commercial leases (income cliff) and airspace development potential (flat roofs). Property owners facing lease expiry in 6-18 months are highly motivated—they must either find new tenants, invest in refurbishment, or sell.

The psychology of lease expiry is predictable and time-bound:
- **12-24 months out:** Owner starts considering options
- **6-12 months:** Peak motivation (must decide)
- **0-6 months:** Urgent—property may already be vacant

Flat-roofed commercial buildings in these situations offer exceptional opportunities for £200k capital:
- **Airspace rights acquisition** (£50k-£150k) rather than freehold purchase
- **Existing utilities, access, structural capacity**
- **8+ storeys achievable** by adding 4-6 residential floors above

Commercial owners with expiring leases often haven't considered airspace value—they're focused on the lease problem. This information asymmetry creates negotiating leverage. You can solve their lease problem (income from airspace sale/JV) while capturing the development upside.

## 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
2. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii)
3. Lease end date: is between 2025-06-01 AND 2027-06-01
4. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 2 AND less than 5
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
8. Total building sqft on title: is greater than 5000
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is less than 1
10. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
```

## 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 10-30 properties per major urban area

**Capital strategy:**
- £200k acquires airspace rights (£80k-£150k) + planning costs (£50k-£70k)
- NOT purchasing freehold—purchasing development rights above existing building
- Owner retains ground-floor commercial income; you develop residential above

**Profit pathway:**
- Acquire airspace rights from motivated owner (lease expiry = receptive to creative deals)
- Existing 3-4 storey building + 4-5 additional storeys = 7-9 storey mixed-use
- Planning precedent: building already exists, adding height only
- GDV: 15-20 residential units @ £300k = £4.5-6M
- Construction cost: £2M-2.5M (residential above commercial simpler than full build)
- Target £2M profit via JV or sell airspace with planning consent

**Key risks:**
1. Structural capacity may limit additional floors (survey essential)
2. Freeholder may want excessive price for airspace rights
3. Lease expiry doesn't guarantee motivation (may find new tenant)
4. Daylight/sunlight impact on neighbors (planning objection)
5. Fire safety/access requirements for tall buildings

**Strengths:**
1. Two motivation signals compound (lease expiry + development opportunity)
2. Low capital entry (airspace rights vs freehold)
3. Existing building = utilities, access, structure
4. Flat roof = purpose-built for vertical extension
5. Transport proximity = high PTAL areas support density
6. Commercial ground floor = mixed-use policy compliant

## 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Airspace rights acquisition | 80,000-150,000 | Depends on location and floors |
| Structural survey | 8,000-12,000 | Critical—determines floor capacity |
| Legal fees | 8,000-12,000 | Complex airspace agreement |
| Planning pre-application | 3,000-5,000 | Early engagement with LPA |
| Full planning application | 20,000-30,000 | Design, heritage, transport, daylight |
| Party wall agreements | 5,000-10,000 | Adjacent properties |
| Contingency | 15,000-20,000 | Extended negotiations/studies |
| **Total** | **139,000-239,000** | Upper range if full £200k deployed |

## 5. Profit Projection Table

| Item | Value (£) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Airspace rights + planning | 150,000 | Total invested |
| Planning uplift value | 400,000-600,000 | Sell airspace rights with consent |
| **Profit (planning exit)** | **250,000-450,000** | Minimal risk approach |
| | | |
| **Full development scenario:** | | |
| Build cost (18 units) | 1,800,000 | £100k per unit (efficient build) |
| GDV (18 units @ £350k) | 6,300,000 | Higher value—transport proximity |
| Finance costs | 200,000 | 12-month development loan |
| Fees/contingency | 300,000 | Sales, management, buffer |
| **Gross profit (JV 50/50)** | **1,850,000** | Partner provides build capital |
| **Gross profit (if sole)** | **3,700,000** | Requires additional finance |

*Note: JV scenario most realistic for £200k capital—partner provides construction finance, split profit*

## Summary: Approach Comparison

| Dimension | Approach E: HMO Expired License | Approach F: Lease Expiry + Airspace |
|-----------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Primary motivation** | Regulatory (cannot operate) | Financial (income cliff) |
| **Capital entry** | Direct purchase or option | Airspace rights only |
| **Development type** | Demolish + rebuild | Add floors to existing |
| **Typical site** | 4-6 storey HMO | 3-4 storey commercial |
| **Target results** | 5-20 per city (very targeted) | 10-30 per city (moderate) |
| **Negotiating leverage** | Very high (illegal to operate) | High (time-bound decision) |
| **Planning complexity** | Full new build consent | Extension/intensification |
| **Risk profile** | Medium-high (limited supply) | Medium (structural unknowns) |

Both approaches target £2M profit through different mechanisms—E through acquisition discount and full redevelopment, F through low-capital airspace play and JV structures. Test both in your target geographies to see which yields more viable opportunities.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

---

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
