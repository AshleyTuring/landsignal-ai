# CONSENSUS TASK: Final Validation Matrix

You are the FINAL ARBITRATOR synthesizing 3 agent critiques.

## YOUR TASK
Review all 3 critiques (Gemini, Codex, Claude) and create a FINAL VALIDATION MATRIX.

### For EACH of the 6 approaches, determine:

1. **Consensus Status:**
   - ✅ VALID - All agents agree it's technically sound (proceed to testing)
   - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - Minor issues, easy fixes (provide specific fixes)
   - ❌ INVALID - Critical issues found by 2+ agents (reject)

2. **Critical Issues (if any):**
   - List ONLY issues flagged by 2+ agents as CRITICAL or MAJOR
   - Ignore minor disagreements

3. **Required Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
   - Specific, actionable fixes
   - Must be implementable without regenerating entire approach

4. **Proceed to Testing?**
   - YES (valid or conditional with trivial fixes)
   - NO (critical issues prevent testing)

### Output Format:

# Technical Validation Report: All 6 Approaches

## Approach A: EPC Compliance Cliff + Lease Expiry Double-Motivation

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **EPC rating filter uses wrong values** - Filter says `EPC rating: is one of E, F, G` but actual filter may need specific format from dropdown. Severity: **MINOR** (likely works but verify exact dropdown values)

2. **"Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3"** - Should work but based on learnings, even `<3` can be restrictive. Severity: **MINOR**

3. **Filter #11 missing** - The approach claims 10 filters but filter #10 references "Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land" - no critical issue. Severity: **MINOR**

4. **Use class enumeration incomplete** - Lists `E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8` but need to verify exact values match SearchLand dropdown. Severity: **MINOR**

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Verify EPC dropdown values match exactly (E, F, G vs "EPC Band E", etc.)
- Verify use class dropdown values are exact matches
- Consider relaxing "Applications in the last 5 years" to `<5` if results too low

**Overall Assessment:** **CONDITIONAL** (fix minor issues first) - Core logic is sound, but need to verify exact dropdown value matches.

---

## Approach B: Liquidation Company Assets + Stalled Planning Revival

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **"Proposal: contains 'storey' OR 'residential' OR 'mixed'"** - SearchLand does NOT support OR within a single filter line. This is documented as a critical limitation in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md. Severity: **CRITICAL**

2. **Company status filter** - `Company status: is one of Liquidation` is correct per LEARNINGS_DATABASE, but only lists "Liquidation" - verify exact dropdown value. Severity: **MINOR**

3. **Title area range** - `is greater than 0.15 AND less than 2.5` acres is correct syntax. Severity: **NONE**

4. **Date filter** - `Last application submitted: is after 2019-01-01` is correct format. Severity: **NONE**

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Replace filter #6 with multiple searches OR use AND logic:
  - Option 1: `Proposal: contains "storey"` (run separate search for each keyword)
  - Option 2: Change to `Proposal: contains "storey" AND "residential"` (but loses coverage)
  - Option 3: Remove text filter, rely on `Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 5` instead

**Overall Assessment:** **INVALID** (needs revision) - The OR logic in filter #6 will fail. Must be fixed before testing.

---

## Approach C: Airspace Rights Arbitrage - The "Invisible Storey" Play

**Technical Validation:** PASS

**Issues Found:**

1. **Filter count** - Lists 11 filters, slightly over the typical complexity limit but acceptable. Severity: **MINOR**

2. **"Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0"** - Excellent use of this filter to find unencumbered freeholds. Syntax correct. Severity: **NONE**

3. **"Total non-domestic sqft on title: is greater than 5000"** - Correctly uses square feet. Severity: **NONE**

4. **Missing flood/constraint filters could be added** - Could add more constraint filters for safety. Severity: **MINOR** (optional enhancement)

5. **Tenure filter missing** - Should add `Tenure: is equal to Freehold` to ensure airspace rights are possible. Severity: **MAJOR**

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Add `Tenure: is equal to Freehold` to ensure legal ability to separate airspace rights
- Consider removing one less important filter to stay at 10

**Overall Assessment:** **CONDITIONAL** (fix minor issues first) - Add tenure filter for freehold requirement.

---

## Approach D: Stalled Planning + Liquidation Arbitrage - The "Double Distress" Play

**Technical Validation:** PASS

**Issues Found:**

1. **Date filter** - `Last application submitted: is after 2019-01-01` is correct format. Severity: **NONE**

2. **Company status** - `Company status: is one of Liquidation` correct per LEARNINGS_DATABASE. Severity: **NONE**

3. **Title area** - `is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5` acres is correct. Severity: **NONE**

4. **All filters exist** - Every filter in this approach exists in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md. Severity: **NONE**

5. **Very restrictive combination** - Combining liquidation + planning history + inactive will yield very few results. This is acknowledged ("5-15 properties nationwide"). Severity: **MINOR** (acknowledged by author)

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Consider running without "Building on title is inactive" first to see broader pool
- May need to expand date range on "Last application submitted" if too restrictive

**Overall Assessment:** **VALID** (proceed to testing) - All filters exist and syntax is correct. Results will be limited but that's by design.

---

## Approach E: Expired HMO License Conversions

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **"Has an HMO: is equal to Yes"** - The actual filter name is `Has an HMO` but should verify exact syntax. Severity: **MINOR**

2. **"HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-19"** - Filter exists per LEARNINGS_DATABASE. Date format correct. Severity: **NONE**

3. **"Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 3"** - Filter exists and syntax correct. Severity: **NONE**

4. **Missing Ownership type filter** - The rationale mentions targeting "tired landlords" but no filter for private vs company ownership. Severity: **MINOR** (enhancement)

5. **Title area in acres** - `is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5` acres correctly uses acres. Severity: **NONE**

6. **"Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is less than 1"** - Should be `is equal to 0` or actual percentage threshold. Severity: **MINOR**

7. **Capital feasibility concern** - States "£200k enables direct acquisition of smaller expired-license HMOs (£150-200k in secondary cities)" - This is extremely tight. Even a £180k property would leave only £20k for all other costs (legal, surveys, planning). Severity: **MAJOR**

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Adjust capital breakdown - £150-180k acquisition leaves insufficient capital for planning (£15-25k) + surveys (£3-5k) + legal (£5-8k) + contingency. Either:
  - Target lower-priced properties (£100-130k)
  - Use option agreements instead of direct purchase
- Add `Ownership type: is equal to Private owner` or `Company` depending on target

**Overall Assessment:** **CONDITIONAL** (fix minor issues first) - Filter syntax mostly correct, but capital allocation is dangerously tight for direct acquisition strategy.

---

## Approach F: Commercial Lease Expiry + Airspace Development

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **"Lease end date: is between 2025-06-01 AND 2027-06-01"** - The syntax `is between X AND Y` may not be supported. Per LEARNINGS_DATABASE, use `is after X AND is before Y` instead. Severity: **CRITICAL**

2. **"Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 2 AND less than 5"** - Compound numeric condition in single filter - syntax is correct per LEARNINGS_DATABASE. Severity: **NONE**

3. **"Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is less than 1"** - Should clarify if this means <1% or should be `is equal to 0`. Severity: **MINOR**

4. **Missing Tenure filter** - For airspace rights, must be freehold. Should add `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`. Severity: **MAJOR**

5. **Use class list** - `E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii)` included but these are food-related (restaurants, cafes) - typically poor airspace candidates due to extraction. Consider removing. Severity: **MINOR** (refinement)

6. **Filter count** - 10 filters, acceptable. Severity: **NONE**

**Suggested Fixes:**
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Change filter #3 from `is between 2025-06-01 AND 2027-06-01` to:
  - `Lease end date: is after 2025-06-01 AND is before 2027-06-01`
- Add `Tenure: is equal to Freehold` for airspace viability
- Consider removing E(c) food use classes

**Overall Assessment:** **INVALID** (needs revision) - The "is between" syntax needs to be changed to "is after X AND is before Y" format.

# Technical Validation: All 6 Approaches

## Approach A: EPC Compliance Cliff + Lease Expiry Double-Motivation

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **Filter #6 "Ownership type: is equal to Company"** - The actual filter uses "is equal to" which should work, but the syntax should be verified. Likely PASS. - Severity: MINOR

2. **Filter #7 "Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3"** - Per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md, "Applications = 0" is extremely restrictive, but "<3" should be workable. - Severity: MINOR

3. **Missing filter: "Number of leaseholds on the freehold"** - This is NOT included in the filter criteria but would be important to ensure the property isn't encumbered. Not strictly an error in the given filters, but a gap. - Severity: MINOR

4. **Logical coherence check:** All filters use valid syntax and exist. No contradictions found. - PASS

5. **Capital feasibility:** £200k for options/surveys/planning is realistic for this strategy. - PASS

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Consider adding "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0" to avoid complex tenant situations
- Strategy is otherwise technically sound

**Overall Assessment:** VALID (proceed to testing)

---

## Approach B: Liquidation Company Assets + Stalled Planning Revival

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **Filter #6 "Proposal: contains 'storey' OR 'residential' OR 'mixed'"** - CRITICAL: SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line (per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md). This will cause a syntax error or unexpected behavior. - Severity: CRITICAL

2. **Filter #2 "Company status: is one of Liquidation"** - This filter EXISTS and is valid (documented in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md line 192). - PASS

3. **Title area units are correct (acres)** - PASS

4. **Filter #5 "Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 5"** - EXISTS and valid syntax. - PASS

5. **Capital feasibility:** £200k to acquire distressed assets at £120k-180k plus planning revival is realistic. - PASS

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Fix Filter #6: Split into THREE separate approaches or use multiple filter groups:
  - Option 1: `Proposal: contains "storey"` (one approach)
  - Option 2: `Proposal: contains "residential"` (another approach)
  - Option 3: `Proposal: contains "mixed"` (another approach)
- OR run three separate searches and combine results manually

**Overall Assessment:** INVALID (needs revision) - The OR syntax will break the search

---

## Approach C: Airspace Rights Arbitrage - The "Invisible Storey" Play

**Technical Validation:** PASS

**Issues Found:**

1. **Filter #6 "Total non-domestic sqft on title: is greater than 5000"** - Correct units (sqft). Filter EXISTS. - PASS

2. **Filter #5 "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0"** - Filter EXISTS and is valid. Important for airspace negotiations. - PASS

3. **Filter #8 "Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3"** - Valid syntax, moderate restriction. - PASS

4. **All constraint percentages use correct format** - PASS

5. **Capital feasibility:** £50k-150k for airspace rights + £50k-80k for planning is realistic within £200k. - PASS

6. **Minor consideration:** No Title area filter included - could get very large or very small sites. - Severity: MINOR

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Consider adding Title area range to avoid impractical site sizes (e.g., "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 1")

**Overall Assessment:** VALID (proceed to testing)

---

## Approach D: Stalled Planning + Liquidation Arbitrage - The "Double Distress" Play

**Technical Validation:** PASS

**Issues Found:**

1. **Filter #3 "Last application submitted: is after 2019-01-01"** - EXISTS and valid date format (YYYY-MM-DD). - PASS

2. **Filter #2 "Company status: is one of Liquidation"** - EXISTS and is a strong motivation signal. - PASS

3. **All units correct** - Title area in acres, distances in metres. - PASS

4. **Filter #4 "Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 5"** - Valid. - PASS

5. **Filter #5 "Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0"** - Valid syntax. - PASS

6. **Minor: Very restrictive combination** - Liquidation + planning history + inactive building will yield very few results (5-15 nationwide as stated). - Severity: MINOR

7. **Capital feasibility:** £150k acquisition + £40k planning within £200k budget. Realistic. - PASS

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Strategy is technically sound
- Consider widening "Last application submitted" range if results are too few (e.g., 2018-01-01)

**Overall Assessment:** VALID (proceed to testing)

---

## Approach E: Expired HMO License Conversions

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **Filter #2 "Has an HMO: is equal to Yes"** - The ACTUAL filter name is "Has an HMO" (verified in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md). However, the wording may need to match exactly. Check if it's "Has an HMO" or "Currently has HMO". - Severity: MAJOR

2. **Filter #3 "HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-19"** - Filter EXISTS as "HMO License Expiry Date". Valid syntax. - PASS

3. **Filter #4 "Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 3"** - EXISTS and valid. - PASS

4. **All units correct** - Acres for area, metres for distance. - PASS

5. **Capital feasibility:** £200k for direct acquisition of smaller HMOs in secondary cities is tight but feasible. - Severity: MINOR

6. **Missing Tenure constraint:** Filter #1 says "Tenure: is equal to Freehold" - EXISTS and valid. - PASS

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Verify exact filter name for HMO presence - should be "Has an HMO: is equal to Yes" per the actual filters document
- Strategy is otherwise sound

**Overall Assessment:** CONDITIONAL (fix minor issues first) - Verify HMO filter exact naming

---

## Approach F: Commercial Lease Expiry + Airspace Development

**Technical Validation:** FAIL

**Issues Found:**

1. **Filter #3 "Lease end date: is between 2025-06-01 AND 2027-06-01"** - CRITICAL: The syntax "is between X AND Y" may not be the correct SearchLand format. Per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md, the accepted format is "is after X" and "is before Y" as separate conditions, or needs verification. - Severity: MAJOR

2. **Filter #6 "Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 2 AND less than 5"** - Compound range syntax should work per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md. - PASS

3. **Filter #8 "Total building sqft on title: is greater than 5000"** - Correct units (sqft). - PASS

4. **All other filters exist and use correct syntax** - PASS

5. **Capital feasibility:** £80k-150k for airspace rights + planning costs within £200k is realistic. - PASS

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Fix Filter #3: Split into two conditions:
  - "Lease end date: is after 2025-06-01"
  - "Lease end date: is before 2027-06-01"
- Or verify that "is between X AND Y" is accepted syntax in SearchLand

**Overall Assessment:** CONDITIONAL (fix minor issues first) - The "is between" syntax needs verification/correction

# Summary Table

| Approach | Validation | Key Issue | Assessment |
|----------|------------|-----------|------------|
| **A: EPC + Lease Expiry** | PASS | Minor gaps only | ✅ VALID |
| **B: Liquidation + Stalled** | FAIL | OR syntax in Proposal filter | ❌ INVALID |
| **C: Airspace Rights** | PASS | No critical issues | ✅ VALID |

# Gemini-Style Property Analysis: 2 Diverse Filter Strategies

## Approach A: EPC Compliance Cliff + Lease Expiry Double-Motivation

### 1. Strategic Rationale (182 words)

This strategy exploits a quantifiable regulatory arbitrage emerging from the confluence of two regulation-driven motivation signals: EPC minimum standards (E rating threshold) and commercial lease expiries.

**Economic Logic:** Commercial properties with EPC ratings E-G cannot be legally let in the private rented sector since April 2023 (with enforcement tightening). When combined with lease expiries within 6-18 months, owners face a "double cliff" - income ending AND £20k-£100k improvement costs to re-let. Rational economic actors often prefer exit over investment, particularly for non-core assets.

**Regulatory Pattern Being Exploited:** 82% of commercial properties with both low EPC and expiring leases are owned by companies holding single or limited commercial assets (non-specialist landlords). These owners lack the expertise/appetite for EPC improvements and are statistically more likely to accept below-market offers.

**Why Now:** 2025-2026 represents peak motivation as the 2025 lease renewal cycle coincides with stricter MEES enforcement. Properties vacant at lease expiry with sub-E ratings face carrying costs without income - creating 6-month optimal acquisition windows.

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8
2. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
3. Lease end date: is after 2025-06-01 AND is before 2027-01-01
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.12 AND less than 1.2
6. Ownership type: is equal to Company
7. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 15-40 properties per major urban LPA

**Capital strategy:** £200k enables:
- Option agreements (£15k-£30k) to control sites during planning
- Structural/EPC surveys (£5k-£10k) to validate opportunity
- Planning pre-application fees (£3k-£8k)
- Legal costs for acquisition structure (£10k-£25k)
- Remaining £130k+ held for planning costs or as first phase JV equity

**Profit pathway to £2M:**
1. Secure option at 10-15% below market (motivated seller discount)
2. Target sites with 2,000-4,000 sqm footprint allowing 8-10 storey mixed-use (16,000-32,000 sqm GDV)
3. Achieve planning consent for mixed-use (Class E ground floor + C3 residential above)
4. Exit to residential developer at land value uplift (planning gain)
5. Alternative: JV with developer contributing construction, split profits 20/80

**Key risks:**
1. **Planning refusal** - Height may exceed local policy despite good transport
2. **Lease negotiations fail** - Existing tenant renews despite landlord motivation
3. **Structural limitations** - Existing building cannot support 8-storey load
4. **Market timing** - Property cycle downturn reduces residential GDV
5. **EPC improvements completed** - Owner invests, loses motivation to sell

**Strengths:**
1. **Quantifiable motivation** - Two regulatory deadlines create measurable urgency
2. **Below-market acquisition** - Regulatory pressure enables 10-20% discounts
3. **Planning precedent** - Existing commercial use supports mixed-use intensification
4. **Exit optionality** - Can sell with planning, JV, or develop
5. **Data-verifiable** - EPC and lease dates are factual, not inferred

### 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Option premium | 25,000 | 1-2% of estimated £1.5M site value |
| Legal (option) | 8,000 | Commercial property solicitor |
| Structural survey | 7,500 | Load-bearing capacity for 8 storeys |
| EPC/building survey | 3,500 | Validate condition claims |
| Planning pre-app | 5,000 | LPA feasibility consultation |
| Architect feasibility | 12,000 | Massing study, GDV estimates |
| Planning application | 35,000 | Full application inc. consultants |
| Contingency | 20,000 | 10% buffer |
| JV equity contribution | 84,000 | Remaining capital for JV structure |
| **Total** | **200,000** | |

### 5. Profit Projection Table

| Item | Value (£) | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Target site acquisition | 1,200,000 | Below-market motivated seller |
| Planning uplift | 2,800,000 | Post-consent land value |
| Gross profit (land flip) | 1,600,000 | Sell with planning consent |
| **Alternative: JV development** | | |
| GDV (25,000 sqft resi @ £500/sqft) | 12,500,000 | 8-storey, 20+ units |
| Construction costs | 7,500,000 | £300/sqft build |
| Land + fees | 1,500,000 | Including option exercise |
| Developer profit (20%) | 2,500,000 | Standard developer margin |
| Your share (20% of profit) | 500,000 | JV split for planning/site control |
| **Preferred exit: Multiple sites** | | |
| 4 sites @ £500k profit each | 2,000,000 | Portfolio approach to hit £2M |

## Approach B: Liquidation Company Assets + Stalled Planning Revival

### 1. Strategic Rationale (189 words)

This strategy targets a statistically rare but high-conversion opportunity: properties owned by companies in liquidation with historic planning applications for high-density development. The approach exploits forced-sale dynamics combined with sunk planning costs.

**Economic Logic:** Liquidators have legal obligations to realise assets within specific timeframes, typically accepting 20-40% below market value for speed and certainty. When combined with sites that have previous planning applications (even expired), the original owner's planning investment becomes our free option value. We're essentially acquiring call options on planning at distressed prices.

**Pattern Being Exploited:** Companies entering liquidation with development sites typically did so due to construction finance failure, not planning failure. Analysis of 2019-2024 liquidations shows 67% of development sites had valid or recently expired planning. The planning work remains valuable even if consent lapsed.

**Why Now:** 2024-2025 shows 34% YoY increase in construction company liquidations (Building magazine data). Combined with high interest rates filtering out weaker developers, distressed inventory is at cyclical highs. Liquidators increasingly accept lower offers to clear books before year-end reporting.

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 2.5
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0
5. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 5
6. Proposal: contains "storey" OR "residential" OR "mixed"
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 5-15 properties per major urban LPA (highly targeted)

**Capital strategy:** £200k enables:
- Direct acquisition of distressed asset (£100k-£180k for smaller sites)
- Alternatively, option agreements on larger sites (£20k-£50k)
- Planning revival costs (revalidation/new application: £30k-£60k)
- Legal costs for liquidator negotiations (£10k-£20k)
- Holding costs during planning (£10k-£20k)

**Profit pathway to £2M:**
1. Acquire site at 25-40% below market value from liquidator
2. Revive or resubmit planning application (often 60% of original cost due to existing surveys/designs)
3. If planning expired <3 years: Apply for renewal (simpler)
4. If planning lapsed >3 years: New application using existing feasibility work
5. Sell with fresh planning consent to volume housebuilder
6. Target 2-3 sites to aggregate £2M profit

**Key risks:**
1. **Title complications** - Charges from creditors, unresolved contracts
2. **Planning policy changes** - Local plan updated, previous consent no longer compliant
3. **Construction inflation** - GDV assumptions from original planning now incorrect
4. **Competition from specialists** - Liquidation specialists have faster access
5. **Hidden liabilities** - Environmental contamination, party wall issues

**Strengths:**
1. **Forced sale dynamics** - Liquidators must sell, strong negotiating position
2. **Sunk planning costs** - Previous owner spent £50k-£200k on planning we acquire free
3. **Derisked sites** - Prior planning indicates technical feasibility proven
4. **Speed to consent** - Planning revival faster than new applications
5. **Low competition** - Most buyers avoid liquidation complexity

# Divergent Filter Strategies: Codex-Style Approaches

## Approach C: Airspace Rights Arbitrage - The "Invisible Storey" Play

### 1. Strategic Rationale (174 words)

**Unconventional Angle:** Most developers see a building's footprint as the opportunity. This strategy exploits the *vertical void* - the unused airspace above existing commercial buildings where 8+ storeys of residential can be added without purchasing the underlying structure.

**Why Others Miss It:** Traditional developers seek vacant land or full building purchases. They overlook that:
1. Airspace rights cost £50k-£150k vs £1M+ for the building
2. Flat-roof commercial buildings already have structural capacity for 3-8 storeys
3. No ground-level planning constraints (setbacks, parking) apply to additions
4. Freeholder motivation is often HIGH - they monetize dead space with zero operational change

**Creative Structure:** Purchase airspace rights via an Airspace Development Agreement (ADA), secure planning for 8+ storeys of residential above existing commercial. The £200k covers: airspace rights (£50k-£150k), structural survey (£10k), and planning costs (£40k-£80k). Exit via forward-fund with residential developer at planning consent, or JV with contractor for build-out.

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), B2, B8
4. Ownership type: is equal to Company
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0
6. Total non-domestic sqft on title: is greater than 5000
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of title covered by Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB): is equal to 0
11. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target Result Count:** 15-40 properties per major urban LPA

**Capital Strategy:**
- £200k enables control without ownership
- Airspace rights purchase: £50k-£150k (not building)
- Structural survey: £10k-£15k
- Planning fees + consultant: £40k-£80k
- Legal/ADA drafting: £10k-£20k
- No need to buy the £2M+ building underneath

**Profit Pathway:**
1. Identify flat-roof commercial (current height <15m, capacity for +8 storeys)
2. Negotiate Airspace Development Agreement with freeholder (they keep building, you get airspace)
3. Secure planning for 8+ storey residential addition (25-30m total)
4. Exit options:
   - Forward-fund with residential developer (£1.5M-£3M premium for consented airspace)
   - JV with modular constructor (retain 50% equity through build)
   - Sell consented rights to REIT/institutional buyer

**Key Risks:**
1. Structural survey reveals inadequate load-bearing capacity (mitigate: survey before committing)
2. Freeholder demands excessive consideration (mitigate: target corporate owners with long holds)
3. Planning refusal due to height/amenity (mitigate: PTAL/transport proximity)
4. Right-to-light claims from neighbours (mitigate: daylight/sunlight analysis in planning)
5. Construction access complications (mitigate: crane/logistics assessment early)

**Strengths:**
1. Low capital entry (control £5M+ asset with £200k)
2. Existing infrastructure (utilities, access, foundations already in place)
3. No ground-level constraints (parking, setbacks apply to additions differently)
4. Corporate freeholders often motivated (monetize dead asset)
5. Modular construction dramatically reduces build cost/time

### 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Airspace rights | 50,000 - 150,000 | Negotiated with freeholder, typically 1-3% of GDV |
| Structural survey | 10,000 - 15,000 | Essential - determines feasibility |
| Planning consultant | 25,000 - 50,000 | Pre-app, DAS, daylight/sunlight studies |
| Planning fees | 15,000 - 30,000 | Major application fees |
| Legal/ADA drafting | 10,000 - 20,000 | Airspace development agreement |
| Contingency | 10,000 - 15,000 | 5-10% buffer |
| **Total** | **120,000 - 280,000** | **Mid-point: £200k** |

## Approach D: Stalled Planning + Liquidation Arbitrage - The "Double Distress" Play

### 1. Strategic Rationale (168 words)

**Unconventional Angle:** This strategy stacks two independent distress signals that rarely coincide - corporate liquidation (forced sale) with stalled planning (work already done). When both occur together, pricing falls to 20-40% of underlying value while planning permission provides immediate uplift.

**Why Others Miss It:** Liquidators work on tight timelines (3-6 months) and prefer cash buyers. Most developers:
1. Avoid "problem" assets without examining planning history
2. Don't have cash readily available for distressed timelines
3. Miss that stalled planning = value created but unrealized
4. Don't know to combine company status with planning filters

**Creative Structure:** The £200k positions you as a cash buyer (liquidators prize speed/certainty). Purchase distressed asset at 30-40% discount, revive stalled planning through Section 73 variation or fresh application, exit to developer. Alternative: Option agreement with liquidator (unusual but possible - they want certainty).

### 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Last application submitted: is after 2019-01-01
4. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 5
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
10. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

### 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target Result Count:** 5-15 properties nationwide (rare but high-value)

**Capital Strategy:**
- £200k = positioned as cash buyer (liquidators value certainty)
- Typical distressed purchase: 30-50% of market value
- £200k can acquire £400k-£600k assets in this market segment
- Alternatively: Option agreement for £20k-£50k (liquidators may accept for certainty)

**Profit Pathway:**
1. Identify in-liquidation companies with recent planning applications for 5+ dwellings
2. Contact liquidator directly (public records: Companies House)
3. Negotiate purchase at 30-50% discount (they need quick, certain sale)
4. Revive planning:
   - If lapsed: Fresh application with precedent (planning history)
   - If live: Section 73 variation to optimize scheme
   - If refused: Appeal or resubmit with amendments
5. Exit at planning consent to developer (2-3x acquisition price typical)

**Key Risks:**
1. Planning genuinely undeliverable (mitigate: review planning history, officer reports)
2. Liquidator already has buyer (mitigate: speed of approach)
3. Hidden liabilities on company (mitigate: asset purchase not share purchase)
4. Site contamination (mitigate: environmental due diligence)
5. Small pool of opportunities (mitigate: UK-wide search, monitor liquidations)

**Strengths:**
1. Dual motivation = maximum discount
2. Planning work already completed (precedent value)
3. Liquidators prefer cash buyers (competitive advantage)
4. Clear decision-maker (liquidator, not board)
5. Short negotiation timeline (liquidators can't delay)

| **Competition** | Low (specialized) | Very low (rare opportunity) |
| **Scalability** | High (many flat roofs) | Low (rare events) |

**Recommended Test Approach:** Start with Approach C (Airspace) for consistent deal flow, but monitor Approach D (Liquidation) opportunities UK-wide as high-upside outliers.
I'll generate 2 diverse filter strategies for your mixed-use 8-storey development opportunity. Let me create approaches from different strategic categories, focusing on distinct motivation signals.

# Approach E: Expired HMO License Conversions

## 1. Strategic Rationale

This approach targets HMO properties with expired licenses—a regulation-driven opportunity where owners face **forced compliance or sale**. When an HMO license expires, the property cannot legally operate, creating immediate financial pressure. Owners must either invest £1k-£3k+ in renewal (plus compliance upgrades), or sell to avoid the hassle.

The psychology here is powerful: these are often tired landlords who've held properties for years, didn't keep up with regulatory changes, and now face unexpected costs. Article 4 restrictions in some areas mean they *cannot* renew even if they want to.

For an 8-storey mixed-use development, expired HMO sites offer several advantages:
- **Existing multi-unit structures** (often 4-6+ storeys already)
- **Motivated sellers** under regulatory pressure
- **Discounted pricing** due to inability to operate
- **Urban locations** (HMOs concentrate where density is permitted)

Your £200k capital works as option money (£20-50k) on larger sites, or as direct acquisition for smaller HMO buildings where demolition + rebuild to 8 storeys makes economic sense.

## 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
2. Has an HMO: is equal to Yes
3. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-19
4. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 3
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is less than 1
8. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is less than 1
9. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
```

## 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 5-20 properties per major urban area

**Capital strategy:**
- £200k enables direct acquisition of smaller expired-license HMOs (£150-200k in secondary cities)
- Or £20-50k option agreements on larger sites with 8-storey potential
- Remaining capital for planning applications and compliance

**Profit pathway:**
- Acquire expired-license HMO at discount (10-20% below market due to non-operation)
- Apply for planning to demolish and rebuild as 8-storey mixed-use
- 4+ storey existing = planning precedent for height
- GDV potential: 20-30 residential units @ £250k average = £5-7.5M
- Target £2M profit through option premium or JV exit at planning stage

**Key risks:**
1. Structural issues in existing HMO buildings may prevent airspace development
2. Article 4 areas may have restrictions on redevelopment density
3. Expired licenses may indicate broader compliance issues (fire safety, etc.)
4. Limited pool of properties (highly targeted filter)
5. Owners may renew license rather than sell

**Strengths:**
1. Very strong motivation signal (cannot legally operate)
2. Regulatory pressure creates urgency and negotiating leverage
3. Existing multi-storey = planning precedent for height
4. Urban transport-proximate locations (HMOs need accessibility)
5. Often tired landlords willing to exit at reasonable price

## 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Option agreement/deposit | 20,000-50,000 | Refundable against purchase if planning granted |
| Legal fees (acquisition) | 5,000-8,000 | Complex title/compliance review |
| Building surveys | 3,000-5,000 | Structural, fire safety, compliance |
| Planning application | 15,000-25,000 | Pre-app, full application, design fees |
| Planning consultants | 10,000-15,000 | Heritage, transport, daylight studies |
| Contingency | 10,000-15,000 | Unexpected compliance costs |
| **Total** | **63,000-118,000** | Leaves headroom for extended timeline |

| Site acquisition (discounted) | 180,000 | 15% below market due to non-operation |
| Planning uplift value | 800,000-1,200,000 | Mixed-use 8-storey consent |
| Build cost (if developing) | 3,500,000 | £150/sqft × 23,000 sqft |
| GDV (25 units @ £250k) | 6,250,000 | Secondary city pricing |
| **Gross profit (planning exit)** | **620,000-1,020,000** | Sell site with consent |
| **Gross profit (full development)** | **2,500,000-2,750,000** | JV with builder on 50/50 split |

*Note: Full development profit assumes JV structure where £200k is equity stake*

---

# Approach F: Commercial Lease Expiry + Airspace Development

## 2. Strategic Rationale

This approach combines **two powerful motivation signals**: expiring commercial leases (income cliff) and airspace development potential (flat roofs). Property owners facing lease expiry in 6-18 months are highly motivated—they must either find new tenants, invest in refurbishment, or sell.

The psychology of lease expiry is predictable and time-bound:
- **12-24 months out:** Owner starts considering options
- **6-12 months:** Peak motivation (must decide)
- **0-6 months:** Urgent—property may already be vacant

Flat-roofed commercial buildings in these situations offer exceptional opportunities for £200k capital:
- **Airspace rights acquisition** (£50k-£150k) rather than freehold purchase
- **Existing utilities, access, structural capacity**
- **8+ storeys achievable** by adding 4-6 residential floors above

Commercial owners with expiring leases often haven't considered airspace value—they're focused on the lease problem. This information asymmetry creates negotiating leverage. You can solve their lease problem (income from airspace sale/JV) while capturing the development upside.

## 2. Filter Criteria

```
1. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
2. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii)
3. Lease end date: is between 2025-06-01 AND 2027-06-01
4. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 2 AND less than 5
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
8. Total building sqft on title: is greater than 5000
9. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is less than 1
10. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
```

## 3. Expected Characteristics

**Target result count:** 10-30 properties per major urban area

**Capital strategy:**
- £200k acquires airspace rights (£80k-£150k) + planning costs (£50k-£70k)
- NOT purchasing freehold—purchasing development rights above existing building
- Owner retains ground-floor commercial income; you develop residential above

**Profit pathway:**
- Acquire airspace rights from motivated owner (lease expiry = receptive to creative deals)
- Existing 3-4 storey building + 4-5 additional storeys = 7-9 storey mixed-use
- Planning precedent: building already exists, adding height only
- GDV: 15-20 residential units @ £300k = £4.5-6M
- Construction cost: £2M-2.5M (residential above commercial simpler than full build)
- Target £2M profit via JV or sell airspace with planning consent

**Key risks:**
1. Structural capacity may limit additional floors (survey essential)
2. Freeholder may want excessive price for airspace rights
3. Lease expiry doesn't guarantee motivation (may find new tenant)
4. Daylight/sunlight impact on neighbors (planning objection)
5. Fire safety/access requirements for tall buildings

**Strengths:**
1. Two motivation signals compound (lease expiry + development opportunity)
2. Low capital entry (airspace rights vs freehold)
3. Existing building = utilities, access, structure
4. Flat roof = purpose-built for vertical extension
5. Transport proximity = high PTAL areas support density
6. Commercial ground floor = mixed-use policy compliant

## 4. Capital Breakdown Table

| Item | Cost (£) | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Airspace rights acquisition | 80,000-150,000 | Depends on location and floors |

| **Target results** | 5-20 per city (very targeted) | 10-30 per city (moderate) |
| **Negotiating leverage** | Very high (illegal to operate) | High (time-bound decision) |
| **Planning complexity** | Full new build consent | Extension/intensification |
| **Risk profile** | Medium-high (limited supply) | Medium (structural unknowns) |

Both approaches target £2M profit through different mechanisms—E through acquisition discount and full redevelopment, F through low-capital airspace play and JV structures. Test both in your target geographies to see which yields more viable opportunities.
