# Filter Requirements

**Project:** MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v3  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Status:** Requirements Complete  
**System Version:** 3.1 (Divergent Hypothesis Testing + Preset Analysis)

---

## Global Context

**You are an expert UK property analyst and power user of SearchLand.co.uk**

You have been tasked with creating SearchLand filters based on user requirements through **divergent hypothesis testing**.

### Available Resources:
- `/SearchlandContext/AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` - **USE ONLY THIS** - Real filters available
- `/SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md` - 86 expert presets (reference)
- `/LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` - Universal implementation behaviors (16+ motivation signals!)
- `/FILTER_PATTERNS.md` - 35 reusable strategies (12 categories)
- `/PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md` - **NEW!** Comprehensive guide to all 86 presets

### CRITICAL RULES:
1. **Output Format**: Use STRUCTURED LIST FORMAT ONLY (not prose)
   - Example: `1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.198 AND less than 2.47`
   - NOT: "Look for properties between 8,000-100,000 sqft"
2. **Units**: Use acres/sqft/metres (as shown in ACTUAL filters)
3. **Filter Names**: Use EXACT names from AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
4. **No Assumptions**: If a filter doesn't exist, propose proxy filters
5. **Divergent Generation**: Create MULTIPLE diverse approaches, not one consensus
6. **Use Preset Insights**: Reference PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md for proven strategies

## Requirement Type

- [x] **Type 1: Profit & Capital Outlay**
- [x] **Type 2: Similar Planning Applications**

---

## Type 1: Profit & Capital Outlay

**Target Profit:** £2,000,000

**Capital Outlay:** £200,000

**Additional Context:**
- Property type preferences: Mixed-use development opportunities, airspace development, stalled planning
- Geographic preferences: UK-wide, focusing on urban areas with good transport
- Risk tolerance: Medium - seeking motivated sellers, creative structures
- Time horizon: 12-24 months to planning/deal completion
- Other considerations: £200k requires option agreements, airspace rights, joint ventures (not direct purchase)

---

## Type 2: Similar Planning Applications

**Reference Planning Application:**

```
Demolition and construction of an 8-storey mixed-use development comprising 
flexible retail (class E) and residential (Class C3) use with associated communal 
terraces, cycle parking, accessible car parking and waste storage
```

**Additional Context:**
- Geographic area: UK-wide, urban areas with high PTAL (London) or good transport (rest of UK)
- Scale preferences: Same size or larger (8+ storeys)
- Must-have features: Mixed-use potential, substantial height capability
- Nice-to-have features: Existing planning (even expired), flat roofs (airspace), corporate ownership
- Exclusions: Heavy constraints (Flood zone 3, Green Belt without exceptions)

---

## Additional Requirements

**Priority Level:**
- [x] High - Need precise matches
- [ ] Medium - Some flexibility acceptable
- [ ] Low - Exploratory search

**Expected Number of Results:**
- [x] Narrow (10-50 properties per approach)
- [ ] Moderate (50-200 properties)
- [ ] Wide (200+ properties)

**Special Considerations:**
- £200k capital = option agreements (£10k-£50k), airspace rights (£50k-£150k), or joint ventures
- Direct purchase at £200k unrealistic for 8-storey developments
- Motivation signals critical: long hold, derelict/inactive, corporate, expired/stalled planning
- Multiple diverse strategies preferred (test 4-6 approaches)
- Target £2M profit = 10x ROI (substantial upside required)

---

## Target Geographies

**Primary:**
- Slough (previous test location)

**Secondary (for testing):**
- Birmingham (lower prices, more options at £200k)
- Manchester (mid-range market)
- London (high PTAL, airspace opportunities, competitive)

**Rationale:** Different approaches may work better in different markets - test empirically

---

## Strategic Guidance (NEW - v3.1 System)

### Potential Approaches to Explore:

Based on PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md and FILTER_PATTERNS.md, consider these DIVERSE strategies:

**Regulation-Driven:**
- Pattern 8A: HMO Expired Licenses (Preset #12) - forced sale
- Pattern 8B: Lease Expiry (Presets #17, #46, #66) - income cliff
- Pattern 8C: EPC Compliance (Presets #2, #20, #69) - cannot rent

**Airspace Development:**
- Pattern 6A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom (Presets #22-#25)
- Preset #23: Commercial no resi (add 8 storeys above)

**Stalled Planning:**
- Pattern 1A: Old Planning + No Activity (with proxy filters)
- Combine with liquidation (discovered by ashsubband!)

**Grey Belt:**
- Pattern 9A: Previously Developed in GB (Presets #7, #44)
- Hardstanding >25% + edge of settlement

**Strategic Land:**
- Pattern 11A: Emerging Allocations (Preset #38) - first mover
- Pattern 11B: Edge of Settlement (Presets #18, #85)

**Corporate Distress:**
- Pattern 2D: Liquidation Sales (User discovery + presets)
- Combine with Pattern 8B: Lease expiry = double motivation

### Expected Diverse Approaches (4-6):

LLMs should generate approaches from DIFFERENT categories:
1. One regulation-driven (HMO/Lease/EPC)
2. One airspace development (flat roofs)
3. One stalled planning (proxy filters)
4. One strategic land/edge (promotion)
5. One corporate distress (liquidation + others)
6. Creative variant (combination)

**DO NOT** generate 6 similar approaches! Explore different strategic angles.

## Notes

**System Version:** 3.1 (Preset Analysis Complete)
- **v1 (archived):** Single convergent approach (0 results)
- **v2 (archived):** Refined convergence (validated structured output)
- **v3.1 (current):** Divergent generation + 86 preset insights + 16 motivation signals

**New Knowledge Since v2:**
- 11 additional motivation signals (HMO licenses, lease expiry, hardstanding, etc.)
- 6 new pattern categories (7-12 from 86 presets)
- 18 new proven strategies
- Commercial viability thresholds (footfall, vehicles)
- Energy project criteria (ag grades, substations)
- Green Belt workarounds (previously developed)
- Strategic land indicators (SHLAA, emerging allocations)

**Key Learnings Applied:**
- "Applications in last 5 years = 0" too restrictive (try "< 3")
- £200k direct purchase extremely limited (need creative structures)
- PTAL filters London-only (use "Distance to Train Station" elsewhere)
- Structured output format essential
- Units: acres (not sqm), sqft (not sqm), metres
- Company status: Liquidation = forced sale (user discovery!)

---

**Next Step:** Stage 1 - Divergent Approach Generation

Generate 4-6 DIVERSE approaches using:
- **Claude** (2 approaches) - I'll do this now
- **Gemini** (2 approaches) - User will run
- **Codex** (2 approaches) - User will run

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

# Reusable Filter Strategy Patterns

**Purpose:** Proven filter strategies that can be adapted across projects
**Scope:** Strategic approaches, NOT technical implementation (see LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md)
**Usage:** LLMs should reference these patterns when creating divergent approaches

---

## Pattern Categories

1. **Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies**
2. **Motivated Seller Strategies**
3. **Development Opportunity Strategies**
4. **Low Capital Entry Strategies**
5. **High-Density/Intensification Strategies**
6. **Airspace Development Strategies**

---

## 1. Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies

### Pattern A: Old Planning + No Recent Activity
```
Strategy: Find sites with old planning applications and no recent development activity
Indicators:
- Last application submitted: >2-3 years ago
- Applications in last 5 years: <3
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Max number of dwellings applied for: >0 (confirms development intent)

Strengths: Targets sites where planning work already done but stalled
Weaknesses: May miss sites with expired planning but recent resubmissions
Capital requirement: Varies (often requires on-market listing filter)
```

### Pattern B: Proposal Keyword + Inactive Building
```
Strategy: Search for specific development types with inactive buildings
Indicators:
- Proposal: contains "[development type]" keywords
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Title area: appropriate size for target development

Strengths: More flexible than date-based approaches
Weaknesses: Doesn't confirm planning has actually lapsed
Capital requirement: Add price filters as needed
```

---

## 2. Motivated Seller Strategies

### Pattern A: Long Corporate Hold + Derelict Asset
```
Strategy: Corporate owners holding derelict assets for 5+ years
Indicators:
- Ownership type: Company
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago
- Building on title is derelict: Yes
- Optional: Sales listing currently on the market: Yes

Strengths: Strong motivation signals (asset write-down, non-core holding)
Weaknesses: Limited pool of properties
Capital requirement: Often suitable for low-capital strategies
```

### Pattern B: Long Market Listing + Price Cap
```
Strategy: Properties listed for extended periods with price constraints
Indicators:
- Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
- Sales listing price: <target amount
- Latest sold date: >3-5 years ago (long hold)

Strengths: Active sellers with demonstrated motivation
Weaknesses: Cannot directly filter for "time on market"
Capital requirement: Directly constrained by price filter
```

### Pattern C: Inactive Building + Transport Proximity
```
Strategy: Inactive/derelict properties near transport (redevelopment angle)
Indicators:
- Building on title is inactive OR derelict: Yes
- Distance to nearest Train Station: <500-1000m
- Title area: appropriate size

Strengths: Combines motivation with development rationale
Weaknesses: Transport proximity doesn't guarantee motivation
Capital requirement: Add price filters for low-capital approaches
```

### Pattern D: Liquidation/Administration Sales ⭐ NEW
```
Strategy: Companies in liquidation or administration forced to sell assets
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Indicators:
- Ownership type: Company
- Company status: is one of Liquidation (or In Administration)
- Optional: Building on title is derelict/inactive (double motivation)
- Optional: Title area appropriate for target development

Strengths:
- VERY STRONG motivation (forced sale, legal obligation)
- Liquidators motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing below market
- Strong buyer negotiating position
- Clear decision-maker (liquidator/administrator)

Weaknesses:
- Limited pool of properties (rare)
- May have complex legal issues
- Other creditors may have claims
- Properties often in poor condition

Capital requirement:
- Often low (distressed pricing)
- Suitable for £50k-£300k range
- Cash buyers preferred (speed advantage)

Proven Performance:
- Highly targeted (typically <10 results per LPA)
- Very strong conversion potential
- Excellent for below-market acquisitions

Example Filter:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 5
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Optional: Building on title is derelict: Yes

Best For:
- Opportunistic buyers with cash
- Distressed asset specialists
- Below-market acquisition strategies
- Quick turnaround projects

Related Filters:
- "In Administration" also strong signal (though company may trade on)
- "Dissolved" less useful (assets already distributed)
```

---

## 3. Development Opportunity Strategies

### Pattern A: Under-Developed + High Accessibility
```
Strategy: Low-density sites in high-transport-accessibility areas
Indicators:
- Max building height on title: <12m (low current density)
- TFL PTAL: 4, 5, 6a, 6b (London only) OR Distance to Train Station: <500m
- Developed area percentage: <40-50%
- Title area: appropriate for target development

Strengths: Clear redevelopment potential with policy support
Weaknesses: PTAL limited to London; may be expensive acquisitions
Capital requirement: Typically requires higher capital or creative financing
```

### Pattern B: Large Plot + Low Building Density
```
Strategy: Large plots with minimal existing development
Indicators:
- Title area (acres): >0.5
- Developed area percentage: <30%
- Number of buildings on title: 0 or 1
- Planning constraints: minimal

Strengths: Clean slate for development
Weaknesses: May require greenfield development expertise
Capital requirement: Land acquisition costs can be high
```

### Pattern C: Existing Use + Upside Potential
```
Strategy: Properties with established use but intensification potential
Indicators:
- Title area: appropriate size
- Max building height: <current vs target differential
- Use class: target class or compatible
- Percentage of plot un-constrained: >70%

Strengths: Income-generating during planning process
Weaknesses: May require change of use or intensification planning
Capital requirement: Higher due to existing use value
```

---

## 4. Low Capital Entry Strategies

### Pattern A: Sub-£200k Direct Purchase
```
Strategy: Direct freehold/leasehold purchase under capital limit
Indicators:
- Sales listing price: <200000 (or target amount)
- Tenure: Freehold
- Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
- Title area: appropriate minimum size

Strengths: Direct acquisition within budget
Weaknesses: Very limited supply; may sacrifice quality/location
Capital requirement: Hard cap at budget limit
```

### Pattern B: Option Agreement Candidates
```
Strategy: Higher-value sites suitable for option agreements
Indicators:
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago (motivated seller potential)
- Ownership type: Company (institutional negotiation)
- Title area: large enough for phased development
- NOT required: Sales listing price filter (off-market approach)

Strengths: Access to better sites with low initial capital
Weaknesses: Requires negotiation skills and legal costs
Capital requirement: £10k-£50k for option + legals
```

### Pattern C: Derelict Asset Turnaround
```
Strategy: Severely derelict properties with rebuild/redevelopment angle
Indicators:
- Building on title is derelict: Yes
- Sales listing price: <target (often distressed pricing)
- Distance to nearest Train Station: <1000m (exit value)
- Title area: appropriate size

Strengths: Discounted pricing, high upside potential
Weaknesses: Requires construction expertise, may have hidden issues
Capital requirement: Acquisition + demolition + rebuild (phase planning)
```

---

## 5. High-Density/Intensification Strategies

### Pattern A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone
```
Strategy: Existing low-rise in areas with tall building policy support
Indicators:
- Max building height on title: <12-15m (current low-rise)
- PTAL: 4-6b OR Distance to Train Station: <500m
- Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: 0%
- Local policy: (manual research: tall building zones)

Strengths: Policy support for height, existing access/utilities
Weaknesses: May face local opposition; requires tall building expertise
Capital requirement: Varies; consider airspace strategies
```

### Pattern B: Existing Approval for Height
```
Strategy: Sites with existing planning approval for tall buildings
Indicators:
- Proposal: contains "storey" AND specific height keywords
- Max number of dwellings applied for: >target threshold
- Last application submitted: recent (within 3 years)
- Building on title status: any

Strengths: Planning derisked, faster to implement
Weaknesses: May be priced at post-planning approval value
Capital requirement: Higher acquisition, lower planning risk
```

### Pattern C: Strategic Site Allocation
```
Strategy: Sites allocated for development in local plans
Indicators:
- Site allocation type: [specific allocation]
- Land Availability Assessment (SHLAA): positive
- In adopted settlement OR In emerging settlement: appropriate
- Title area: matches allocation size

Strengths: Policy-backed development rights
Weaknesses: May have Section 106/CIL obligations
Capital requirement: Varies by allocation
```

---

## 6. Airspace Development Strategies

### Pattern A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom
```
Strategy: Existing buildings with flat roofs and height capacity
Indicators:

Strategy: Previously developed land in Green Belt (exception to protection)
Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

Strengths:

Capital requirement: Often cheaper than pure urban (£50k-£300k)

Example Filters:

Grey Belt (Preset #7):
1. Freehold tenure
2. More than 25% area developed
3. More than 10% hardstanding (key indicator)
4. Within 100m of built up area
5. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3, National parks, Conservation area, etc.

- NOT SHLAA assessed OR negative (hidden gems)
- Private owner (easier to deal)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 5% developed (undeveloped land)

Strategic Rationale:
- Local authorities review settlement boundaries periodically
- Sites on edges = natural expansion direction
- No SHLAA = no one else promoting (first mover advantage)
- Promote to get allocated in next local plan

Strengths:
- Lower competition (undiscovered)
- Can influence local plan
- Option agreements with minimal capital
- Value jump when allocated

Weaknesses:
- Long timeline (2-5 years for allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation
- Requires planning expertise

Capital requirement: Low for option (£5k-£50k), patient capital

Example Filters:

Edge of Settlement (Preset #18):

Un-Allocated No SHLAA (Preset #85):
1. NOT SHLAA positive/neutral/negative (not assessed!)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m of settlement boundary
4. Company or private owner
5. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)

Strategy:
1. Identify edge-of-settlement sites
2. Secure option agreement (low capital)
3. Promote to local authority (planning consultancy)
4. Get allocated in local plan
5. Apply for planning permission
6. Exit to housebuilder

- Planning policy support (renewable targets)
- Lower grade land = less objections

Weaknesses:
- Large capital (£500k-£5M+ for development)
- Grid connection costs if >2km
- Planning can still be refused (local opposition)
- Long development timeline (12-24 months)

Capital requirement:
- Option: £10k-£50k
- Development: £500k per acre (equipment + grid)
- Often project-financed

Revenue Model:
- Lease to solar operator: £800-£1,200/acre/year
- Or develop + sell to operator
- 25-year income stream

Example Filter (Preset #14):
1. Freehold tenure

Strategy: Specific commercial uses with defined criteria
Source: SearchLand Presets (Padel #10/#70, Care Homes #28)
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Padel Courts (Growing Trend):
- 1,500-6,500 sqmt
- 7-15m building height (convert existing buildings)
- Commercial use class (E, B2, B8)
- Within 400m bus OR 800m train OR 5m built-up (accessibility)
- Company/private owner

Care Homes:
- 4,000+ sqmt
- ≤10% developed (room for building)
- Within 500m of hospital
- Demographics: Aged 50-69 nearby
- NOT corporate/council/HA ownership

Strategic Rationale:
- Niche markets have specific requirements
- Less competition than mainstream
- Defined criteria = easier to source

Strengths:
- Clear targeting criteria
- Growing markets (padel, elderly care)
- Less mainstream competition

Weaknesses:
- Niche = smaller pool of buyers
- Specialized knowledge required

Capital requirement: £200k-£2M

Example Filter - Padel (Preset #10):
1. 1,500-6,500 sqmt
2. 7-15m building height
3. E, B2, B8, E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii), or E(d) use class
4. Within 400m bus OR 800m train OR 5m built-up area
5. Company or private owner
6. 75%+ un-constrained

Best For:
- Niche operators
- Trend-followers
- Specialized developers

## Strategy Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern:

**Budget-Driven:**
- <£50k → Option Agreement, Airspace Rights
- £50k-£200k → Sub-£200k Direct, Derelict Turnaround
- £200k-£500k → Under-Developed + Accessibility, Stalled Planning
- >£500k → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Low risk → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations
- Medium risk → Stalled Planning, Under-Developed Sites
- High risk → Derelict Turnaround, Airspace Development

**Timeline:**
- Fast (<12 months) → Existing Approvals, Option Exercise
- Medium (12-24 months) → Stalled Planning Revival, Turnarounds
- Long (24+ months) → Greenfield Development, Strategic Allocations

**Expertise Required:**
- Low → Sub-£200k Direct Purchase, Simple Turnarounds
- Medium → Stalled Planning, Motivated Sellers
- High → Airspace Development, Tall Buildings, Strategic Sites

---

## Combining Patterns

### Example: "Mixed-Use 8-Storey £2M Profit on £200k Capital"

**Possible Approach Combinations:**

1. **Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A) + Motivated Seller (Pattern 2A)**
   - Find stalled mixed-use planning with corporate seller motivation
   - Low acquisition cost, planning precedent exists
   - Capital: option agreement or distressed purchase

2. **Under-Developed (Pattern 3A) + Airspace (Pattern 6A)**
   - High PTAL, flat roof, existing low-rise
   - Add 4-6 storeys of residential above
   - Capital: airspace rights + construction finance

3. **Derelict Turnaround (Pattern 4C) + Height Intensification (Pattern 5A)**
   - Derelict building in tall building zone
   - Demolish + rebuild to 8 storeys
   - Capital: acquisition + phased construction

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### ❌ Over-Constraining
```
Problem: Combining too many restrictive filters
Example: Applications = 0 AND Price <£200k AND Derelict AND On-market AND PTAL 6a
Result: 0 results (filters compound restrictiveness)
Solution: Test incrementally, use separate filter groups for different approaches
```

### ❌ Geographic Mismatches
```
Problem: Using London-specific filters (PTAL) for UK-wide searches
Example: PTAL filter outside TfL area
Result: 0 results
Solution: Create separate approaches for London vs rest of UK
```

### ❌ Assuming Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem: Designing strategy around filters that don't exist
Example: "Planning Status: Expired" or "Price Reduced"
Result: Cannot implement strategy
Solution: Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md first
```

## Preset Categories (Detailed)

### Category 1: Permitted Development Rights (PDR) - 7 Presets

**Strategy:** Bypass full planning via PDR routes

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 4 | Class MA (pre-configured) | E commercial → residential, 2yr use, <4,000 sqmt | £100k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 6 | Class Q (pre-configured) | Agricultural → residential, suitable structure | £50k-£300k | 12-24m |
| 8 | Infill (pre-configured) | C3 + space for additional dwelling, road access | £50k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 30 | Class A | Houses: extensions/alterations, 7m+ height | £50k-£200k | 6-12m |
| 31 | Class G | Space above shops → 2 flats, <250 sqmt | £50k-£200k | 12-18m |
| 32 | Class MA eligible | E commercial in built-up, 100-8,000 sqmt | £100k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 33 | Class ZA | Small commercial rebuild, <1,000 sqmt, <18m height | £100k-£400k | 12-18m |

**Strategic Insights:**
- PDR = faster than planning (6-12 months vs 12-24 months)
- Class MA most popular (SearchLand calculates profit automatically)
- Size restrictions critical (e.g., Class G limited to 250 sqmt, 2 flats max)
- Conservation areas and AONB excluded from most PDR

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 7A-7D

---

### Category 2: Airspace Development - 4 Presets

**Strategy:** Add storeys to existing buildings (flat roofs)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 22 | Airspace: 8+ addresses | Flats, flat roof, 8+ units, freehold | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 23 | Airspace: Commercial no resi | E commercial, flat roof, no C3 | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 24 | Airspace: Pre-1990 | Built ≤1990, flat roof, 8+ units | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 25 | Airspace: Unbroken freeholds | <1 leasehold, flat roof, 8+ units | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |

**Strategic Insights:**
- Flat roof = essential filter
- Freehold = simpler negotiation (no head lease)
- Pre-1990 = often undervalued, structural capacity varies
- Unbroken freeholds = no leaseholders to negotiate with
- Structural survey critical (cost £5k-£15k)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 6A-6B

### Category 3: Renewable Energy - 13 Presets

**Strategy:** Solar, wind, BESS, hydrogen, bio-energy projects

#### Solar Projects (5 presets)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 14 | Solar ground mount | 40k+ sqmt, Ag Grade 3b/4, <2km green substation | £500k-£5M | 12-24m |
| 34 | Commercial solar rooftops | B2/B8/E, flat roof, low EPC, 500+ sqmt | £50k-£500k | 6-12m |
| 49 | Industrial solar | B2/B8/E(g)(iii), owner-occupied, 1k+ sqmt | £50k-£500k | 6-12m |
| 71 | Paper manufacturers solar | SIC codes paper/printing, 5k+ sqmt, freehold | £100k-£1M | 12-18m |
| 73 | Poultry farms solar | SIC codes poultry, private/company, 1k+ sqmt | £50k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 81 | Solar land search | Same as #14 (duplicate) | £500k-£5M | 12-24m |
| 82 | Solar lease opportunities | Leasehold, solar/energy/renewable companies | Varies | Varies |
| 83 | Solar manufacturing owner-occ | Manufacturing SIC codes, B2/E/E(g)(iii), 1k+ sqmt | £50k-£500k | 12-18m |

#### Other Renewable Energy (5 presets)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 51 | BESS (Battery Storage) | 20k-400k sqmt, <2km green substation, flat terrain | £5M-£50M | 24-36m |
| 52 | Bio-energy sites | Ag Grade 3b/4/5, <3km substation, >300m from built-up | £1M-£10M | 24-36m |
| 55 | Hydrogen sites | 8k-20k sqmt, <200m substation, >500m sensitive uses | £5M-£20M | 24-36m |
| 56 | Onshore wind | 20k-400k sqmt, Ag Grade 3b/4, >500m built-up | £5M-£50M | 24-48m |
| 45 | Ground-mounted solar GB | Green Belt + "ground mounted" + "solar" proposal | Varies | 24-36m |

**Strategic Insights - Solar:**
- **Ground mount:** Agricultural Grade 3b/4 essential (Grade 1-2 = planning refusal)
- **Rooftop:** Target high-energy users (manufacturing, warehousing)
- **Owner-occupied:** Easier than landlord/tenant (split incentive)
- **SIC code targeting:** Paper, poultry, manufacturing = high energy bills

**Strategic Insights - Other Renewable:**
- **Substation proximity CRITICAL:** <2km for solar/wind/BESS, <200m for hydrogen
- **Green rated substation:** Must have capacity (grid connection expensive if not)
- **Safety buffers:** Hydrogen >500m from schools/hospitals/care homes
- **Scale:** All require large capital (institutional investors)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A-10D

---

### Category 4: Regulation-Driven Opportunities - 6 Presets

**Strategy:** Regulation forces owner action (motivates sale)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 12 | HMO expired licenses | HMO license expired | Cannot operate legally | £100k-£400k |
| 17 | Commercial expiring leases | Lease ends <2027, B2/B8/E, stale | Income cliff approaching | £200k-£1M+ |
| 41 | Fast food expired leases | E(b) food/drink, lease expired | Income ended | £100k-£500k |
| 46 | High footfall lease expiry | 6k+ footfall, lease 6-12m | Prime location, motivated | £500k-£3M+ |
| 66 | Office blocks expiring | E(g) offices, lease <2026 | Income ending | £300k-£2M+ |
| 78 | Single flats expiring leases | C3 flat, lease <2099, 1 address | Lease running out | £50k-£300k |

**Additional EPC-Related (implicit regulation):**

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2 | Run down homes | EPC E/F/G, detached, <30% developed | Cannot rent legally | £100k-£400k |
| 20 | Unsold poor EPC | EPC E/F/G, sold before 2004 (20+ years!) | Cannot rent + tired owner | £50k-£300k |
| 36 | ECO4 | EPC E/F/G, 5+ addresses, private owner | Grant-eligible improvements | £200k-£1M |
| 47 | HMO opportunities | 8-12 rooms, low EPC, sold before 2014 | Conversion + improvement needed | £150k-£500k |
| 67 | Offices low EPC | EPC D/E/F/G, E commercial, office type | High energy costs | £200k-£1M+ |
| 69 | Older houses outdoor space | No sold date, low EPC, no apps 5 years | Legacy holding + cannot rent | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **HMO licenses:** Expired = illegal to operate → forced renewal (£1k-£3k) or sale
- **Lease expiry:** 6-12 months = peak motivation (owner deciding)
- **Vacant post-expiry:** Strongest signal (no income, carrying costs)
- **EPC E-G:** Cannot rent in private sector since 2020 → improvement (£5k-£50k) or sale
- **Combine signals:** E.g., expired HMO license + low EPC = double motivation

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A-8C

---

### Category 5: Green Belt Strategies - 5 Presets

**Strategy:** Exploit "previously developed" and edge-of-settlement exceptions

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategic Rationale | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| 7 | Grey Belt | 25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding, GB, <100m built-up | Previously developed exception | £50k-£300k |
| 43 | GB sites with hardstanding | 1%+ GB, 1k-10k sqmt, built-up or <100m | Edge + previous development | £50k-£300k |
| 44 | Grey Belt low GB review | GB Review score 1-2, 25%+ hardstanding, <100m built-up | Low environmental impact | £50k-£300k |
| 45 | Ground-mounted solar GB | Proposal "ground mounted" + "solar", GB | Renewable energy exception | £500k-£5M |
| 57 | Storage in Green Belt | Built-up, B2/B8, 0-20% developed, NOT GB (!?) | Note: Preset name misleading | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Previously developed land:** >10-30% hardstanding = brownfield status
- **Hardstanding = proxy:** Concrete/asphalt from demolished buildings, car parks
- **Edge of settlement:** <100m from built-up = less "green" objection
- **Green Belt Review scores:** 1-2 = low landscape/environmental value
- **Planning still required:** These are exceptions, not guarantees
- **Less competition:** Many developers avoid GB entirely (opportunity)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A-9B

---

### Category 6: Strategic Land Promotion - 8 Presets

**Strategy:** Promote sites into local plans or exploit allocations

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategy | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| 13 | Edge of settlement 2+ acres | 8k+ sqmt, private, <1 app, edge location | Promote for allocation | £10k-£50k option |
| 18 | Edge of settlement | 1k-8k sqmt, no sold date, <1 app 5yr, 1-10% built-up | Legacy holdings promotion | £10k-£50k option |
| 26 | Allocated 5-50 acres | 20k-200k sqmt, employment allocation, <100m A/B road | Strategic employment land | £1M+ per acre |
| 38 | Emerging sites no planning | Emerging allocation, <1 app, 4k-40k sqmt | First mover advantage | £10k-£50k option |
| 63 | Planning 10-100 units | 8k+ sqmt, 10-100 dwellings applied, in settlement | Existing planning | £500k-£5M |
| 75 | Residential allocations | 4k-40k sqmt, housing/mixed allocation, private | Policy-backed sites | £100k-£1M+ |
| 85 | Un-allocated no SHLAA 1-10 acres | NOT SHLAA, NOT allocated, <50m settlement, 4k-40k sqmt | Hidden gems to promote | £10k-£50k option |
| 86 | Un-allocated private 4k+ sqmt | Private, 4k+ sqmt, NOT allocated, <200m settlement | Edge promotion | £10k-£50k option |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Emerging allocations (#38):** Allocated but no planning yet = first mover advantage
- **No SHLAA (#85, #86):** Not assessed by authority = hidden opportunity to promote
- **Edge of settlement:** <50-200m from boundary = natural expansion direction
- **"No latest sold date":** Never sold = inherited/legacy (may not know value)
- **Option agreements:** Low capital (£10k-£50k), control site, promote to LA
- **Timelines:** 2-5 years for allocation → planning → sale
- **Planning expertise:** Essential for promotion strategies

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A-11B

| 28 | Care home opportunities | 4k+ sqmt, <500m hospital, aged 50-69 nearby | Elderly demand | £1M-£5M+ |
| 70 | Padel opportunities (v2) | 1k-6k sqmt, 5-12m height, built-up, <100m A road | Growing trend | £200k-£1M |
| 29 | Car parks | Car park use, 1k-4k sqmt, <5% developed, <1 app 5yr | Redevelopment | £100k-£1M |

**Strategic Insights - Footfall:**
- **800+ footfall:** Minimum viable for cafe/restaurant
- **2,000+ footfall:** Good retail location
- **6,000+ footfall:** Prime retail (supports premium rents)
- **Data-driven:** SearchLand provides actual footfall counts (powerful)

**Strategic Insights - Vehicle Count:**
- **10,000+ vehicles/day:** Minimum for petrol/drive-thru/EV viability
- **Major road proximity:** Essential for visibility and access
- **EV charging:** Also needs <5km green substation (power supply)

**Strategic Insights - Niche:**
- **Padel courts:** Growing trend, 7-15m height = convert existing buildings
- **Care homes:** Demographics filter (aged 50-69) + hospital proximity
- **Car parks:** Often redevelopment opportunities (high land value, low use)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A-12C

---

### Category 8: Residential Infill/Improvement - 6 Presets

**Strategy:** Existing residential with development/improvement potential

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategy | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Unbroken freeholds | 3-15 addresses, 0 leaseholds, private, C3 only | Split/repurpose multi-unit | £200k-£1M |
| 2 | Run down homes | EPC E/F/G, detached, <30% developed, 2k-4.1k sqmt | Rebuild/improve | £100k-£400k |

| 74 | Private C3 1+ acre land | Private, C3, 4k+ sqmt, 1 address, built-up, unconstrained | Large plot infill | £300k-£1.5M |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Unbroken freeholds:** No leaseholders = easier to split or sell individually
- **Run down:** Low EPC + detached = demolish + rebuild often best ROI
- **Big gardens:** <5% developed = 95% of plot is garden (infill potential)
- **Private ownership:** Family homes, often unmotivated until approached
- **NOT on market:** Off-market opportunities (less competition)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Patterns 1-4

## Key Strategic Learnings from Presets

### 1. Motivation Signals (NEW - from Preset Analysis)

**Regulation-Driven (Strongest):**
- ⚠️ HMO License Expiry Date (cannot operate)
- ⚠️ Lease end date (income cliff)
- ⚠️ EPC E-G rating (cannot rent)

**Time-Based:**
- No latest sold date (never sold = legacy)
- Latest sold date >20 years ago
- <1 application in last 5 years (no activity)

**Corporate:**
- Company status: Liquidation (from user discovery)
- 30+ titles owned (portfolio divestment)

### 2. Previously Undocumented Filters

**From Preset Analysis:**
- `Hardstanding percentage` (proxy for previously developed)
- `Agricultural Land Grade` (energy project viability)
- `SHLAA status` (strategic land indicator)
- `Green Belt Review score` (environmental impact)
- `SIC codes` (industry targeting)
- `Average daily footfall` (commercial viability)
- `Average daily vehicle count` (traffic-dependent viability)
- `Distance to green rated substation` (energy projects)
- `EPC recommendations contains "solar"` (improvement suggestions)

### 3. Clever Filter Combinations

**ANY Logic (Accessibility):**
Preset #10 (Padel):
```
Within 400m of bus stop OR
Within 800m of train station OR
Within 5m of built up area
```
→ Flexible accessibility requirements

**Compound Targeting:**
Preset #7 (Grey Belt):
```
Green Belt location +
25%+ developed +
10%+ hardstanding +
Within 100m built-up +
NOT: [long list of absolute constraints]
```
→ Multiple signals = "previously developed in GB"

**Strategic Constraint Targeting:**
Preset #13 (Edge of Settlement):
```
1-99% green belt coverage OR
1-99% another constraint coverage
```
→ Targets edge cases (partially constrained = opportunity)

### 4. Threshold Insights

**Commercial Viability:**
- 800+ footfall = Viable cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = Prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = Viable petrol/drive-thru/EV

**Energy Projects:**
- <2,000m substation = Solar/wind/BESS viable
- <200m substation = Hydrogen viable (high power)
- <5,000m substation = EV charging viable

**Size Thresholds:**
- Class MA: <4,000 sqmt title
- Class G: <250 sqmt (only 2 flats)
- Solar ground mount: >40,000 sqmt (10 acres min)
- BESS: 20,000-400,000 sqmt (5-100 acres)

**Hardstanding (Previously Developed):**
- 10%+ = Minimal indicator
- 25-30%+ = Clear previously developed
- 40%+ = Significant (car parks)

## Using This Guide

### For New Projects:

1. **Review relevant preset category** for your requirements
2. **Extract filter criteria** as starting point
3. **Apply learnings** from motivation signals
4. **Adapt to local geography** (e.g., PTAL = London only)
5. **Test empirically** (presets are proven but adapt to market)

### For Divergent Approach Generation:

- **Use presets as inspiration** for diverse approaches
- **Different preset categories** = different approaches
- **Combine patterns** (e.g., HMO expiry + low EPC + edge settlement)
- **Don't copy exactly** - adapt and improve

### For Validation:

- **Check against AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md**
- **Verify filter names exactly match**
- **Confirm units (acres/sqft/metres)**
- **Test thresholds** (presets provide proven numbers)

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)
```

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

Example:
1. [Exact filter usage]

Performance/Notes:
- [Any observations]
```
Related: [Link to FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable]
```

### Recent Contributions:

**2025-11-19:**
- ✅ "Company status: Liquidation" as strong motivation signal (User: ashsubband)
  - Added to LEARNINGS_DATABASE (line 192)
  - Added Pattern 2D to FILTER_PATTERNS.md
  - Discovered via real SearchLand exploration

**2025-11-19 (System v3.0 launch):**
