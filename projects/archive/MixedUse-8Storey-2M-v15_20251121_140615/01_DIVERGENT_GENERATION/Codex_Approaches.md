### Approach A: Stalled Mixed-Use Consent Revival
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A – Old Planning + No Recent Activity  
**Capital Required:** £120k option premium securing the title + £50k planning refresh/transport studies + £30k surveys and legal = £200k (control via option/JV, no land purchase)  
**Expected Results:** ~25-40 titles across major UK cores

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 1.5
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use" OR contains "flexible retail" OR contains "8-storey"
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 40
4. Last application submitted: is before 2023-01-01
5. Building on title is inactive: equals Yes
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
7. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 15
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 700
9. Sales listing currently on the market: equals Yes
10. Latest sold date: is before 2018-01-01
```

**Rationale:** Directly mirrors the approved 8-storey mixed-use precedent (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:111) while respecting the £2M profit / £200k capital brief that relies on control strategies rather than purchases (same file:92-99). Using the Proposal, dwelling count, title area, inactivity, and transport filters listed in the ACTUAL SearchLand capabilities ensures every criterion can be implemented (same file:3544-3663, 3708-3799).  
**Strengths:**  
- Recycles already-approved massing, cutting design risk and timeline to the 12-24 month goal (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:100).  
- Inactive titles plus on-market signals highlight motivated sellers suited to optioning.  
- Urban rail proximity underpins the planning case for higher density.

**Limitations:**  
- Requires diligence on why prior consent stalled (viability, covenants).  
- Some consents may have lapsed policy support; revalidation costs must be modeled.

**Implementation Strategy:** Run the filters UK-wide, cluster by local authority, and download application documents to confirm 25-35m envelopes and communal amenity specs from the precedent. Approach owners with option/JV terms sized to cover refresh costs, then target Section 73 or re-submission to reinstate consent before marketing to funding partners.

### Approach B: High-PTAL Airspace Retail Stacks
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A – Airspace Development on Flat Roof Stock  
**Capital Required:** £80k airspace option premium + £70k structural/feasibility work (engineer, cost, rights of light) + £50k legal + rights negotiations = £200k  
**Expected Results:** ~50-70 titles in London zones 2-4 and core regional centres

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b) OR E(g)(i)
2. A building in the title has flat roof: equals Yes
3. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 3 AND less than 6
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Number of addresses: is greater than 5
6. Ownership type: is Company
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 400
9. Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m): is less than 150
10. Average footfall count passing title daily: is greater than 6000
11. Sales listing status: equals Available
12. Latest sold date: is before 2017-01-01
```

**Rationale:** Focuses on commercial blocks that already host retail/Class E frontage (line 97) and sit in high-accessibility zones, making vertical extensions for mixed-use logical. Filters rely solely on verified SearchLand parameters such as flat roofs, PTAL proxies, footfall, and transport distances (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3544-3663, 3708-3899).  
**Strengths:**  
- Airspace deals need limited upfront capital yet can add 3-4 storeys to hit the 8-storey target profitably.  
- High footfall corridors provide strong covenant uplift when adding residential above retail.  
- Corporate owners are accustomed to JV structures and portfolio recycling.

**Limitations:**  
- Structural capacity and rights-of-light can kill deals; extra due diligence needed.  
- PTAL data is London-specific, so regional cities require manual confirmation of transport equivalence.

**Implementation Strategy:** Prioritize PTAL 4-6 (or equivalent tram/metro catchments) and map shortlisted titles against borough tall-building policies. Open negotiations for rooftop options, then commission feasibility packs to evidence limited impact on existing retail tenants before packaging the uplift to funding partners.

### Approach C: Mot-IV High Street Reinvention
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2C – Inactive Building + Transport Proximity  
**Capital Required:** £60k exclusivity deposit + £90k planning/architect/market studies + £50k JV/legal + stakeholder budgets = £200k  
**Expected Results:** ~70-100 titles, mainly secondary high streets in growth cities

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1
2. Building on title is derelict: equals Yes
3. Ownership type: is Company
4. Sales listing currently on the market: equals Yes
5. Sales listing price: is less than 1000000
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
7. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 25
8. Use class: is B2 OR B8 OR E OR E(g)(iii)
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
10. Average vehicle count passing title daily: is greater than 10000
11. Number of titles owned by company: is greater than 10
```

**Rationale:** Targets corporate-held, derelict edge-of-centre assets with strong traffic counts, enabling creative JV or profit-share deals that match the medium risk appetite and airspace/mixed-use preferences (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:97-100). Filter set sticks to ACTUAL SearchLand fields covering dereliction, ownership, pricing, transport, and motivation metrics (same file:3544-3899).  
**Strengths:**  
- Derelict status plus on-market pricing under £1M gives room to secure options well within £200k.  
- High vehicle counts signal future retail/amenity demand under an 8-storey mixed-use repositioning.  
- Portfolio owners (10+ titles) often divest non-core blocks quickly when offered JV uplift.

**Limitations:**  
- Many assets will require demolition and potential contamination remediation.  
- Some corporate vendors may insist on proof of funds despite JV structure.

**Implementation Strategy:** Filter results, then layer local policy checks (housing delivery tests, tall-building zones) manually. Approach portfolio owners with structured offers—split profit share plus option premium—while running parallel market testing for ground-floor occupiers to validate rent assumptions that underpin the £2M target uplift.

All filters referenced above are pulled from the verified SearchLand Available Filters section (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3544-3899), and each approach aligns with the capital/profit brief and planning precedent described earlier (same file:92-111). Natural next steps: test each filter set in SearchLand, export target lists, and begin outreach for option negotiations.
