## Approach A: Precedent-Driven Mixed-Use Intensification

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A: Similar planning approvals (8-storey mixed-use)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000-£200,000 (option agreements £50k-£100k, planning costs £50k-£100k)  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "8-storey" AND "mixed-use"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with recent planning approvals for 8-storey mixed-use developments similar to the Slough precedent, focusing on urban locations with transport accessibility and no green belt constraints. By identifying sites where similar schemes have been approved, we reduce planning risk while leveraging precedent analysis to demonstrate viability.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent reduces planning uncertainty
- Urban transport proximity supports density
- Inactive buildings indicate redevelopment potential
- Recent approvals (2020+) show current policy support

**Limitations:**
- Limited to sites with existing approvals (not new opportunities)
- May face competition from other developers
- Requires detailed precedent research
- Transport filters may exclude some viable sites

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify approved 8-storey mixed-use sites
2. Research planning applications for key success factors (height, use mix, amenity)
3. Secure option agreements (£50k-£100k) on similar sites without planning
4. Apply for planning using precedents, targeting 25-35m height with retail ground floor
5. Negotiate airspace rights or direct purchase within £200k budget
6. Exit via planning permission sale to housebuilder

## Approach B: Capital-Efficient Airspace Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, £50k-£150k rights)  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£150,000 (airspace rights £50k-£100k, option deposits £10k-£50k)  
**Expected Results:** 30-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
6. Ownership type: is equal to Company
7. Latest sold date: is before 2019-01-01
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy exploits airspace development potential on existing commercial buildings in urban areas with transport links, targeting corporate owners with long hold periods who may be motivated to monetize unused roof space. The approach fits within £200k capital by focusing on airspace rights rather than full acquisition, enabling 8-storey additions above existing structures.

**Strengths:**
- Low upfront capital via airspace rights
- Existing utilities and access reduce development costs
- Corporate owners often open to creative structures
- Transport proximity supports residential viability

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural engineering assessment
- Freeholder negotiation can be complex
- May face leaseholder objections
- Planning for height additions still required

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify flat-roof commercial buildings under 15m height
2. Research freeholder ownership and approach with airspace proposal
3. Secure option agreements (£10k-£50k) for airspace rights (£50k-£100k)
4. Conduct structural surveys and obtain planning for 4-6 storey residential addition
5. Structure deal as airspace lease or sale with overage on future development
6. Partner with residential developer for construction financing

## Approach C: Regulation-Driven Legacy Holdings

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2A: Long corporate hold + derelict asset  
**Capital Required:** £80,000-£120,000 (option agreements £20k-£50k, acquisition £50k-£100k)  
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 1.5
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
7. Company status: is one of Liquidation
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets corporate-owned derelict assets held for over 10 years with minimal recent activity, leveraging liquidation status as a strong motivation signal. By focusing on sites suitable for mixed-use redevelopment near transport, we identify motivated sellers willing to accept creative capital structures within the £200k budget.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation from liquidation status
- Derelict condition justifies low pricing
- Long corporate hold indicates non-core asset
- Transport proximity supports 8-storey density

**Limitations:**
- Liquidation properties may have complex legal issues
- Derelict sites require remediation costs
- Limited pool of liquidation cases
- May require distressed asset expertise

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for liquidation companies with derelict long-hold assets
2. Verify site suitability for 8-storey mixed-use via precedent analysis
3. Approach liquidators with option proposals (£20k-£50k deposits)
4. Secure planning for demolition and 8-storey rebuild with retail ground floor
5. Structure acquisition within £100k-£150k total capital
6. Exit via planning permission sale or direct development with JV partner
