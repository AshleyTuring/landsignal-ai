## DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS

# DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS REPORT

After analyzing all four critique files, I have identified **significant technical disagreements** that require resolution.

---

## DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

---

### Disagreement #1: Claude Approach A - Flood Zone Filter Validity

**Type:** Filter existence / Syntax validity  
**Approaches:** Claude Approach A  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**VALID** - Flawless - correct enum syntax, proper filter names" (Zero issues identified)
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - `NOT: Flood zone 3` is not an actual filter. Must use `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0`"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Invalid Filter Syntax: The prompt uses `NOT: Flood zone 3`. This is not a valid SearchLand filter. Replace with `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0`"
- **Grok Critique:** "**VALID** - All filters exist, syntax is valid"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES  
**Reason:** Three LLMs (Codex, Gemini, Grok) disagree on whether the flood zone exclusion filter exists/is valid. Claude says it's flawless, but Codex and Gemini explicitly flag it as invalid syntax. This is a factual dispute about filter availability.

---

### Disagreement #2: Claude Approach B - Capital Budget Compliance

**Type:** Capital feasibility  
**Approaches:** Claude Approach B  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**VALID** - Valid with minor clarifications. Minor note: Upper capital limit (£190k) is 95% of budget - tight"
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - The capital line item allows spend up to £210k, which breaches the £200k limit"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Capital allocation is within budget" (but flags other issues)
- **Grok Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - capital upper end exceeds £200k but phased implementation possible"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES  
**Reason:** Codex explicitly states the approach breaches the £200k limit (£210k), while Claude says it's valid at £190k. This is a factual dispute about whether the capital allocation complies with the budget constraint.

---

### Disagreement #3: Claude Approach B - Conservation Area Filter Validity

**Type:** Filter existence / Syntax validity  
**Approaches:** Claude Approach B  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**VALID** - Valid with minor clarifications (filter names standardization)"
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - `NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot` cannot be parsed; only specific coverage/distance filters are available. Must use `Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0` plus `Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building (acres): is equal to 0`"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Invalid Constraint Syntax: `NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot` is not valid. Replace with two separate filters"
- **Grok Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - syntax valid" (flags only PTAL geography issue)

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES  
**Reason:** Claude says syntax is valid with minor clarifications, but Codex and Gemini explicitly state the `NOT:` exclusion syntax is invalid and cannot be parsed.

---

### Disagreement #4: Claude Approach C - Multiple Filter Name Validity

**Type:** Filter existence / Syntax validity  
**Approaches:** Claude Approach C  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - 3 syntax corrections needed: (1) 'Currently has HMO: Yes' → 'Has an HMO: is equal to Yes', (2) 'Freehold tenure: Yes' → 'Tenure: is equal to Freehold', (3) 'Less than 1 application: Yes' → 'Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1'"
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Same three filter issues identified with identical corrections"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Same three filter issues identified with identical corrections"
- **Grok Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Requires manual precedent research (not automated)" (does NOT flag filter syntax issues)

**Impact:** Minor  
**Requires iteration:** NO  
**Reason:** Three LLMs (Claude, Codex, Gemini) agree on the exact filter syntax errors and fixes. Grok doesn't mention these issues but flags a different concern (manual research requirement). This is **consensus agreement** on technical corrections, not a disagreement.

---

### Disagreement #5: Codex Approaches A, B, C - OR Logic Syntax Validity

**Type:** Syntax validity  
**Approaches:** All three Codex approaches  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL (all 3)** - Incorrect OR logic syntax. Must use 'is one of' with full enum names. Fix difficulty: Low to Medium (5-20 min)"
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL (all 3)** - Same OR logic issue identified with identical corrections"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL (all 3)** - Same OR logic issue identified with identical corrections"
- **Grok Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL (all 3)** - Syntax invalid - OR logic not supported. Use 'is one of' enum list or split filters"

**Impact:** Minor  
**Requires iteration:** NO  
**Reason:** All four LLMs **unanimously agree** that Codex's OR syntax is invalid and requires the same fix. This is complete consensus, not a disagreement.

---

### Disagreement #6: Gemini Approach A - Planning Cost Realism

**Type:** Capital feasibility / Business case validity  
**Approaches:** Gemini Approach A  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**VALID** - £65k (32.5% of budget - MOST EFFICIENT!) Flawless syntax, solid business case"
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Only £5k earmarked for planning despite 8-storey applications needing £40k-£60k. Capital plan non-credible. Must rebase budget to £40k-£60k for planning"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**VALID** - Technically and financially sound. All filters correct, capital within budget"
- **Grok Critique:** "**VALID** - All filters exist, syntax valid, capital within £200k, ROI achievable"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES  
**Reason:** Codex explicitly states the £5k planning allocation is "non-credible" and undermines the capital plan, while Claude, Gemini, and Grok all mark it as valid and financially sound. This is a business case feasibility dispute.

---

### Disagreement #7: Gemini Approach B - ROI Documentation Completeness

**Type:** Business case validity  
**Approaches:** Gemini Approach B  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**VALID** - Perfect - best airspace approach in entire review. £1M-£2M+ realistic for London airspace"
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Filters valid but approach omits GDV, unit counts, or any ROI evidence. Business case cannot be validated. Must add London PTAL case study"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**VALID** - Well-constructed airspace strategy. Capital realistic and within £200k limit"
- **Grok Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - ROI achievable, but PTAL filter London-only, limiting geography"

**Impact:** Minor  
**Requires iteration:** NO  
**Reason:** This is a **documentation completeness** issue, not a technical/business case disagreement. Codex flags missing ROI *documentation*, but doesn't dispute that the ROI is *achievable* (which is what matters for business case validity). The approach itself is sound.

---

### Disagreement #8: Gemini Approach C - Overall Validity

**Type:** Multiple (filter validity, capital feasibility, business case)  
**Approaches:** Gemini Approach C  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**VALID** - Flawless syntax, correct liquidation enum values. Minor note: Liquidation properties rare (may be 0-5 results)"
- **Codex Critique:** "**INVALID** - Spends £170k on acquisition + £30k fees with zero allowance for surveys, architects, or planning fees for 8-storey consent. Implementation impossible within budget"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Strategy logically sound, budget appropriate. Technical issue: `Use class` includes invalid values 'Unused land' and 'Vacant/derelict land'"
- **Grok Critique:** "**VALID** - All filters exist, syntax valid, capital within £200k, ROI achievable via JV exit"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES  
**Reason:** This is a **three-way split** on validity:
- Claude + Grok: VALID (technically flawless, capital works)
- Gemini: CONDITIONAL (minor filter value error)
- Codex: INVALID (capital plan fundamentally broken)

Codex's position directly contradicts the other three LLMs on capital feasibility.

---

### Disagreement #9: Grok Approach A - Planning Filter Capability

**Type:** Filter existence / Technical capability  
**Approaches:** Grok Approach A  

**Positions:**
- **Claude Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - Date filter ambiguity: 'Last application: is after 2020-01-01' finds sites WITH recent approvals, but implementation says 'sites WITHOUT planning'. Must clarify intent"
- **Codex Critique:** "**CONDITIONAL** - SearchLand has no 'planning status = approved' filter, cannot guarantee only seeing approvals. Needs manual check phase"
- **Gemini Critique:** "**VALID** - Technically flawless and financially viable. All filters correct and exist"
- **Grok Critique:** "**VALID** - All filters exist, syntax valid, logical coherence matches strategy"

**Impact:** Minor  
**Requires iteration:** NO  
**Reason:** Claude and Codex raise concerns about filter interpretation/capability, but both still rate it CONDITIONAL (fixable), not INVALID. Gemini and Grok say it's fully valid. This is more about **strategic clarification** than a hard technical disagreement.

## SUMMARY OF CRITICAL DISAGREEMENTS REQUIRING ITERATION

| # | Approach | Issue | LLMs in Conflict | Impact |
|---|----------|-------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | Claude A | Flood zone filter exists? | Claude (valid) vs. Codex/Gemini (invalid) | Critical |
| 2 | Claude B | Capital £190k or £210k? | Claude (£190k valid) vs. Codex (£210k breach) | Critical |
| 3 | Claude B | Conservation filter valid? | Claude (valid) vs. Codex/Gemini (invalid) | Critical |
| 6 | Gemini A | £5k planning realistic? | Codex (non-credible) vs. Claude/Gemini/Grok (valid) | Critical |
| 8 | Gemini C | Capital plan works? | Codex (invalid) vs. Claude/Gemini/Grok (valid) | Critical |

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Five critical disagreements require immediate iteration** to establish factual ground truth:

1. **Verify filter existence** against AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md for disputed filters (flood zone, conservation area)
2. **Recalculate capital** for Claude B to confirm whether it's £190k or £210k
3. **Validate planning cost assumptions** for Gemini A (£5k vs £40k-£60k)
4. **Clarify capital allocation** for Gemini C (does £200k cover acquisition + planning or not?)
5. **Document resolution rationale** for each disagreement to ensure consistency

All other flagged issues represent **consensus corrections** (e.g., Codex OR syntax, Claude C filter names) that all LLMs agree on.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

---

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

- **Business:** Liquidation + derelict + 10-year hold = maximum pressure
- **Strategic note:** One of the strongest overall approaches

#### **Approach A: Precedent-Driven** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Capital:** £150k-£200k
- **Issue:** Date filter ambiguity - "Last application: is after 2020-01-01" finds sites WITH recent approvals, but implementation says "sites WITHOUT planning"
- **Fix:** Clarify if this is (1) research phase (find precedents) or (2) execution phase (find opportunities)
- **Suggested:** Split into 2-stage process OR invert date filter to "is before 2020-01-01"

### 🥈 CLAUDE - 67% Valid Rate (Strong Strategic Thinking)

#### **Approach A: Expired High-Rise (Liquidation)** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £70k-£125k (35-62.5%)
- **Technical:** Excellent - all filters valid, correct syntax
- **Business:** Liquidation = forced sale (strongest motivation), planning precedent reduces risk
- **Minor note:** Expected results (5-15) may be optimistic - liquidations are rare events

#### **Approach B: Low-Rise PTAL (Airspace)** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £110k-£190k (55-95%)
- **Technical:** Valid with minor clarifications (filter names standardization)
- **Business:** PTAL 5-6b + lease expiry = strong timing pressure, £1M-£2M+ ROI realistic
- **Minor note:** Upper capital limit (£190k) is 95% of budget - tight

#### **Approach C: HMO Precedent** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Capital:** £65k-£105k (32.5-52.5%)
- **Issues:** 3 syntax corrections needed:
  1. "Currently has HMO: Yes" → "Has an HMO: is equal to Yes"
  2. "Freehold tenure: Yes" → "Tenure: is equal to Freehold"  
  3. "Less than 1 application: Yes" → "Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1"
- **Business:** Triple motivation (expired HMO + low EPC + tired landlord) = powerful
- **Strategic note:** Most sophisticated approach - manual precedent research is feature, not bug

### 🔴 CODEX - 0% Valid Rate (Requires Systematic Fixes)

**Common Issue Across All 3 Approaches:** Incorrect OR logic syntax
- Used: `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b)` ❌
- Should be: `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial...", "E(a) - Display...", etc.` ✅

SearchLand does NOT support OR within single filter - must use **"is one of"** with full enum names.

#### **Approach A: Stalled Mixed-Use** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:** 
  - Filter #2: OR logic in Proposal field (must use AND keywords instead)
  - Filters #5, #9: "equals Yes" should be "is equal to Yes"
- **Strategy:** Sound (Pattern 1A: Old Planning + No Recent Activity)
- **Fix difficulty:** Low (5-10 min)

#### **Approach B: High-PTAL Airspace** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:**
  - Filter #1: OR logic in Use class (must use "is one of" with full names)
  - Filter #11: "Sales listing status: equals Available" should be "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
  - Filters #2, #6: syntax corrections
- **Strategy:** Strong (high-footfall targeting is sophisticated)
- **Fix difficulty:** Medium (15-20 min - requires full enum names)

#### **Approach C: High Street Reinvention** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:**
  - Filter #8: OR logic in Use class (must use "is one of")
  - Filters #2, #3, #4: "equals" should be "is equal to"
- **Strategy:** Solid (vehicle count + portfolio targeting is clever)
- **Fix difficulty:** Medium (15-20 min)

## CRITICAL TECHNICAL LEARNINGS

### 1. **OR Logic Does NOT Work in SearchLand** ❌
**Wrong:** `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b)`  
**Right:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or sale..."`

### 2. **Enum Names: Use Full Names (Best Practice)**
- Gemini consistently used full enum names ✅
- Grok used short codes (E, E(a)) - acceptable but risky
- Codex attempted OR logic - caused all failures

### 3. **Filter Name Precision Matters**
- "Currently has HMO" ❌ → "Has an HMO" ✅
- "Freehold tenure: Yes" ❌ → "Tenure: is equal to Freehold" ✅
- Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md for exact names

### 4. **All Approaches Correctly Handled:**
- ✅ Date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ✅ Unit conversions (acres not sqm, metres not feet)
- ✅ AND logic within fields
- ✅ Numeric ranges
