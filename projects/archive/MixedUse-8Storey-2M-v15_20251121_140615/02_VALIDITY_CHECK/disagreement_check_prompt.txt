# Disagreement Detection Task

Analyze the 4 critique files and identify TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS CASE DISAGREEMENTS.

## What Counts as Disagreement
- LLM A says filter exists, LLM B says it doesn't (factual dispute)
- LLM A says "acres", LLM B says "sqft" for same filter (unit dispute)
- LLM A says VALID syntax, LLM B says INVALID syntax (technical dispute)
- LLM A says £200k is sufficient, LLM B says it's not (capital feasibility dispute)
- LLM A says ROI achievable, LLM B says unrealistic (business case dispute)
- LLM A says deal structure works, LLM B says legally/financially flawed (implementation dispute)

## What Does NOT Count
- Priority rankings (A ranks #1, B ranks #3 - both valid)
- Strategic preferences (speed vs certainty - philosophical)
- Implementation styles (different but both correct)

## Special Note on Precedent-Based Approaches
For approaches replicating user-provided planning applications:
- Business case is AUTO-VALID (user requested it)
- Focus validation on: Do filters actually replicate the precedent correctly?
- Multiple valid filter implementations are expected and acceptable

## Output Format
If disagreements exist:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** [Filter existence | Units | Syntax | Capital feasibility | ROI | Deal structure]  
**Approaches:** [Which approaches affected]  
**Positions:**
- LLM A: [Position]
- LLM B: [Position]
- LLM C: [Position]
- LLM D: [Position]

**Impact:** [Critical | Minor]  
**Requires iteration:** [YES | NO]

If no disagreements:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: NO

All LLMs agree on technical and business case facts. Strategic differences are preserved.

## DETAILED FINDINGS BY LLM

### 🥇 GEMINI - 100% Valid Rate (Best Technical Execution)

#### **Approach A: Urban Intensification** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £65k (32.5% of budget - MOST EFFICIENT!)
- **Technical:** Flawless - correct enum syntax, proper filter names
- **Business:** Off-market targeting, 10-year hold motivation, solid £500k-£1.5M profit potential
- **Minor note:** Expected results may be lower end of stated range (restrictive filters)

#### **Approach B: Airspace Precedent** - ✅ **VALID** 
- **Capital:** £165k (82.5%)
- **Technical:** Perfect - best airspace approach in entire review
- **Business:** London PTAL 4-6b targeting, "unbroken freehold" (<1 leaseholder) is sophisticated
- **ROI:** £1M-£2M+ realistic for London airspace
- **Strategic note:** Technically the best-executed approach overall

#### **Approach C: Distressed Asset** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £200k (100% - aggressive)
- **Technical:** Flawless syntax, correct liquidation enum values
- **Business:** High-risk/high-reward acknowledged, includes specialist legal costs
- **Minor note:** Liquidation properties rare (may be 0-5 results, not 5-15 as stated)

---

### 🥈 GROK - 67% Valid Rate (Strong Execution)

#### **Approach B: Capital-Efficient Airspace** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £100k-£150k (50-75%)
- **Technical:** Clean, flawless execution
- **Business:** UK-wide airspace, corporate targeting, 6+ year holds
- **Strategic note:** One of the cleanest approaches in entire review

#### **Approach C: Regulation-Driven Legacy** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £80k-£120k (40-60%)
- **Technical:** Perfect - triple motivation signals elegantly combined
- **Business:** Liquidation + derelict + 10-year hold = maximum pressure
- **Strategic note:** One of the strongest overall approaches

#### **Approach A: Precedent-Driven** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Capital:** £150k-£200k
- **Issue:** Date filter ambiguity - "Last application: is after 2020-01-01" finds sites WITH recent approvals, but implementation says "sites WITHOUT planning"
- **Fix:** Clarify if this is (1) research phase (find precedents) or (2) execution phase (find opportunities)
- **Suggested:** Split into 2-stage process OR invert date filter to "is before 2020-01-01"

---

### 🥈 CLAUDE - 67% Valid Rate (Strong Strategic Thinking)

#### **Approach A: Expired High-Rise (Liquidation)** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £70k-£125k (35-62.5%)
- **Technical:** Excellent - all filters valid, correct syntax
- **Business:** Liquidation = forced sale (strongest motivation), planning precedent reduces risk
- **Minor note:** Expected results (5-15) may be optimistic - liquidations are rare events

#### **Approach B: Low-Rise PTAL (Airspace)** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £110k-£190k (55-95%)
- **Technical:** Valid with minor clarifications (filter names standardization)
- **Business:** PTAL 5-6b + lease expiry = strong timing pressure, £1M-£2M+ ROI realistic
- **Minor note:** Upper capital limit (£190k) is 95% of budget - tight

#### **Approach C: HMO Precedent** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Capital:** £65k-£105k (32.5-52.5%)
- **Issues:** 3 syntax corrections needed:
  1. "Currently has HMO: Yes" → "Has an HMO: is equal to Yes"
  2. "Freehold tenure: Yes" → "Tenure: is equal to Freehold"  
  3. "Less than 1 application: Yes" → "Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1"
- **Business:** Triple motivation (expired HMO + low EPC + tired landlord) = powerful
- **Strategic note:** Most sophisticated approach - manual precedent research is feature, not bug

---

### 🔴 CODEX - 0% Valid Rate (Requires Systematic Fixes)

**Common Issue Across All 3 Approaches:** Incorrect OR logic syntax
- Used: `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b)` ❌
- Should be: `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial...", "E(a) - Display...", etc.` ✅

SearchLand does NOT support OR within single filter - must use **"is one of"** with full enum names.

#### **Approach A: Stalled Mixed-Use** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:** 
  - Filter #2: OR logic in Proposal field (must use AND keywords instead)
  - Filters #5, #9: "equals Yes" should be "is equal to Yes"
- **Strategy:** Sound (Pattern 1A: Old Planning + No Recent Activity)
- **Fix difficulty:** Low (5-10 min)

#### **Approach B: High-PTAL Airspace** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:**
  - Filter #1: OR logic in Use class (must use "is one of" with full names)
  - Filter #11: "Sales listing status: equals Available" should be "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
  - Filters #2, #6: syntax corrections
- **Strategy:** Strong (high-footfall targeting is sophisticated)
- **Fix difficulty:** Medium (15-20 min - requires full enum names)

#### **Approach C: High Street Reinvention** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:**
  - Filter #8: OR logic in Use class (must use "is one of")
  - Filters #2, #3, #4: "equals" should be "is equal to"
- **Strategy:** Solid (vehicle count + portfolio targeting is clever)
- **Fix difficulty:** Medium (15-20 min)

---

## CRITICAL TECHNICAL LEARNINGS

### 1. **OR Logic Does NOT Work in SearchLand** ❌
**Wrong:** `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b)`  
**Right:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or sale..."`

### 2. **Enum Names: Use Full Names (Best Practice)**
- Gemini consistently used full enum names ✅
- Grok used short codes (E, E(a)) - acceptable but risky
- Codex attempted OR logic - caused all failures

### 3. **Filter Name Precision Matters**
- "Currently has HMO" ❌ → "Has an HMO" ✅
- "Freehold tenure: Yes" ❌ → "Tenure: is equal to Freehold" ✅
- Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md for exact names

### 4. **All Approaches Correctly Handled:**
- ✅ Date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ✅ Unit conversions (acres not sqm, metres not feet)
- ✅ AND logic within fields
- ✅ Numeric ranges

## BUSINESS CASE VALIDATION

### Capital Efficiency Rankings:

| Rank | Approach | Capital | % Budget |
|------|----------|---------|----------|
| 🥇 | Gemini A | £65k | 32.5% |
| 🥈 | Claude C | £65k-£105k | 32.5-52.5% |
| 🥉 | Claude A | £70k-£125k | 35-62.5% |
| 4th | Grok C | £80k-£120k | 40-60% |
| 5th | Grok B | £100k-£150k | 50-75% |
| 6th | Claude B | £110k-£190k | 55-95% |
| 7th | Codex A | £120k-£200k | 60-100% |
| 8th | Gemini B | £165k | 82.5% |
| 9th | Codex B, C & Gemini C | £200k | 100% 🔴 |

**Insight:** Option agreements (£15k-£50k) are most capital-efficient. Direct acquisitions use 100% of budget (no overrun buffer).

### ROI Feasibility (£2M Target):

| Strategy Type | Profit Range | Achievability |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|
| **London PTAL 5-6b Airspace** | £1M-£2M+ | ✅ **High** |
| **Liquidation + Planning** | £500k-£2M+ | ✅ **High** |
| **High-Footfall Airspace** | £1M-£2M+ | ✅ **High** |
| **Stalled Consent Revival** | £500k-£2M+ | ✅ **High** |
| **HMO + Precedent** | £500k-£1.5M | ⚠️ **Medium** |
| **Off-Market Intensification** | £500k-£1.5M | ⚠️ **Medium** |
| **Distressed Asset** | £500k-£2M+ | ⚠️ **Medium-High** |

**Conclusion:** £2M target achievable with London focus OR strong motivation signals (liquidation, expired HMO).

### Codex_Critique

### Claude - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters mostly align with the brief and capital/ROI are plausible, but one of the required exclusions cannot be implemented in SearchLand as written.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `NOT: Flood zone 3` is not an actual filter. Flood-risk exclusions must be expressed via the coverage/area metrics listed in the verified filter set (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:81; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3628).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace the invalid clause with `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0` (or the “area not covered” equivalent) so that the search can run.
- Keep the rest of the structure as-is once the filter is corrected; ROI and capital logic already line up with the £2M/£200k brief.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Strong combination of liquidation pressure and lapsed consents should keep motivation high once the syntax is fixed.

---

### Claude - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Targeting PTAL-backed flat roofs with lease expiries is coherent, but both the exclusion syntax and the top-end capital draw exceed project constraints.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot` cannot be parsed; only the specific coverage/distance filters are available (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:149; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3626 and 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3632).
- The capital line item allows spend up to £210k, which breaches the £200k limit this project set (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:205).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Swap the invalid `NOT` clause for `Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0` plus `Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building (acres): is equal to 0`.
- Trim or defer at least £10k of the planning/legal stack (e.g., vendor-funded surveys or staged option payments) so the high case still fits within £200k.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Lease expiries plus PTAL effectively target the policy support window once the syntax/budget issues are resolved.

---

### Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The regulatory-pressure concept is sound, but two filters are formatted in ways SearchLand cannot execute.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes` is not a valid field; the platform exposes `Applications in the last 5 years` which needs an explicit numeric comparison (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:230; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3581).
- `NOT: Article 4 directions` is not supported; you must reference `Article 4` or its percentage coverage field instead (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:231; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3637).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Rewrite the activity filter as `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`.
- Replace the Article 4 exclusion with `Article 4: is equal to No` or `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0`.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Once the filters work, the three-pronged motivation (HMO licence, EPC, precedent) remains a high-leverage play.

---

### Codex - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The stalled-consent search logic is implementable, but the write-up never shows how the scheme delivers the £2M profit requirement, leaving the business case unproven.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The section outlines filters and process only (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:327) and does not include any GDV/exit comparison or residual that demonstrates a >£2M target uplift.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add a simple residual or precedent sale calculation (units x £/sqft minus build/refresh costs) showing that reviving and trading one of these consents can realistically clear £2M.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Recycling stalled consents is inherently efficient once ROI evidence is documented.

---

### Codex - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The airspace retail stack concept fits the mandate, but the SearchLand syntax is incorrect and the ROI story is absent.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b) OR E(g)(i)` is invalid—the platform expects the `is one of` syntax shown in the filter reference (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:367; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:810).
- No profitability or exit evidence is provided for this pathway (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:360).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Reformat the use-class line as `Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i)`.
- Add an outline showing how many units or sqft you can stack on these roofs and the resulting margin to prove the £2M target is attainable.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- High-footfall London corridors are sensible once the prompt syntax and ROI are clarified.

---

### Codex - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Motivated high-street reinvention is appealing, but the same syntax/ROI gaps recur.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Use class: is B2 OR B8 OR E OR E(g)(iii)` needs the `is one of` structure to run (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:409; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:810).
- There is no calculation showing how the JV/option structure generates the £2M profit target (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:395).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Rewrite the use-class filter as `Use class: is one of B2, B8, E, E(g)(iii)`.
- Include either a precedent GDV uplift (traffic-linked rents + added storeys) or a residual that demonstrates the stated profit ambition.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Portfolio disposals with derelict stock should stay in scope once the prompt and economics are tightened.

---

### Gemini - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The search profile suits the brief, but the capital plan underestimates planning costs and the ROI story is missing.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Only £5k is earmarked for “initial planning & design reports” despite 8-storey applications elsewhere in the same pack needing £40k-£60k of professional spend (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:484 vs. 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:200). This makes the capital plan non-credible.
- No exit/profit calculation is provided for the option exercise (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:435).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Rebase the budget to include at least £40k-£60k for architecture, planning consultancy, and fees, even if staged.
- Add a simple residual (e.g., 40 units × £X margin) showing the >£2M upside once planning is secured.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Off-market low-rise stock near transport remains a useful channel once the numbers are realistic.

---

### Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters are technically valid, but the approach never demonstrates that stacking airspace will reach the £2M target.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The entire section (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:488) omits GDV, unit counts, or any ROI evidence, so the business case cannot be validated.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add a London PTAL case study quantifying the additional floorspace, build cost, and likely disposal value to confirm a >£2M margin.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Freehold-only airspace deals are attractive once profitability is proven.

---

### Gemini - Approach C: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** The plan assumes the whole £200k can buy a 0.2–2 acre derelict mixed-use site outright, leaving no funding for planning or enabling work, and it still omits any ROI maths.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The capital plan spends £170k on acquisition plus £30k on fees/holding, with zero allowance for the surveys, architects, or planning fees needed for an 8-storey consent (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:582). That makes implementation impossible within budget.
- No profit or exit projection is offered for the strategy (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:538).

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Reframe this as an option/JV (instead of an outright purchase) with staged spend and explicit residuals if you want it back on the table.

---

### Grok - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The idea of piggybacking on recent approvals is solid, but SearchLand cannot filter by planning decision status, so the automation claim is overstated and ROI is still missing.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- SearchLand has no “planning status = approved” filter, so the prompt cannot guarantee you’re only seeing approvals; the plan needs a manual check phase (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:609; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3587).
- There is no quantified profitability path in this section (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:592).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Explicitly add a manual validation step (e.g., download decisions) after running the keyword search.
- Provide a precedent sale/option uplift that demonstrates the >£2M target.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Still a good framework for “precedent-led” outreach once validation and ROI are added.

---

### Grok - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The airspace filters are precise, yet the narrative never proves the capital stack results in a £2M profit.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The section lays out filters and implementation only (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:632) with no GDV/ROI evidence tied to the £2M requirement.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Provide an example (e.g., add 4 storeys of 20 units × £100k margin) to validate the target profit.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Broadening beyond London via transport proxies could keep funnel sizes healthy once ROI is documented.

---

### Grok - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Long-held derelict corporate assets in liquidation match the mandate, but profitability is again undocumented.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The write-up (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:672) describes filters, rationale, and process but never quantifies how the £80k-£120k control spend becomes a £2M profit.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Include a sample valuation uplift (e.g., acquisition discount vs. post-planning exit) to evidence ROI, and ensure any remediation/planning costs are accounted for.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Combining liquidation and dereliction is powerful once the economic model is explicit.

---

**Next steps:** Once each team updates its filter syntax, capital allocation, and ROI evidence per the notes above, rerun the SearchLand prompts to confirm they execute cleanly and document at least one £2M+ residual per approach.

### Gemini_Critique

Loaded cached credentials.
Here is the technical and business case validity review of all submitted approaches.

### Claude_Approaches - Approach A: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The approach is strategically sound and financially viable within the stated budget. However, it uses invalid syntax for filtering out constraints.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid Filter Syntax:** The prompt uses `NOT: Flood zone 3`. This is not a valid SearchLand filter.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Replace `NOT: Flood zone 3` with `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0`.
- Ensure date format is `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2022-01-01`).

### Claude_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is strong, targeting a clear opportunity. The capital allocation is within budget. However, the prompt contains multiple technical errors regarding filter names, values, and syntax.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` values:** The prompt uses abbreviations (e.g., `E`, `E(a)`). It must use the full text descriptions (e.g., `"E - Commercial, Business and Service"`).
- **Invalid `Tenure` filter:** The prompt uses `Freehold tenure: Yes`. The correct filter is `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`.
- **Invalid Constraint Syntax:** The prompt uses `NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot`. This is not valid.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Correct the `Use class` filter to use `is one of` with the full, exact text for each class.
- Change `Freehold tenure: Yes` to `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`.
- Replace the `NOT` filter with two separate filters: `Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0` AND `Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building (acres): is equal to 0`.
- Ensure date formats are `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Claude_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** This is a sophisticated and well-reasoned strategy with a high potential for success. The budget is appropriate. However, like the other Claude approaches, it suffers from numerous technical filter implementation errors.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid Filter Name:** `Currently has HMO: Yes` should be `Has an HMO: is equal to Yes`.
- **Invalid `Tenure` filter:** `Freehold tenure: Yes` should be `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`.
- **Invalid Application Filter:** `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes` should be `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`.
- **Invalid Constraint Syntax:** `NOT: Article 4 directions` is not a valid filter.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Correct all filter names and values as listed above.
- Replace `NOT: Article 4 directions` with `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0`.
- Ensure date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

---
### Codex_Approaches - Approach A: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is valid and the budget is feasible. The core technical issue is the use of "OR" logic within a single filter field, which is not supported by SearchLand.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Proposal` Syntax:** The prompt `Proposal: contains "mixed use" OR contains "flexible retail" OR contains "8-storey"` is invalid. SearchLand does not support `OR` logic within a single text field.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- This requires creating three separate, identical filter groups and connecting them with an "OR" condition at the group level. Each group would contain all the filters, but with a different `Proposal` keyword (one for "mixed use", one for "flexible retail", one for "8-storey").

### Codex_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The airspace strategy is financially sound and well-targeted. The only issue is the technically incorrect formatting of the `Use class` filter.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` Syntax:** The prompt uses `is E OR E(a) OR E(b) OR E(g)(i)`. This is invalid. It requires the `is one of` operator and the full text descriptions for each class.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Rewrite the filter as: `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or sale of retail goods, other than hot food", ...` including the full text for all desired classes.

### Codex_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy targeting derelict, corporate-owned assets is viable and the budget is appropriate. The implementation is flawed only by the incorrect `Use class` filter syntax.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` Syntax:** The prompt uses `is B2 OR B8 OR E OR E(g)(iii)`. This is invalid.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Rewrite the filter using the `is one of` operator and the full text descriptions for each class (e.g., `"B2 - General industrial"`).

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is technically and financially sound. All filters exist, use correct syntax and units, and logically cohere with the stated off-market strategy. The capital requirement is well within budget.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a well-constructed airspace strategy. All filters are valid and correctly implemented. The capital breakdown is realistic and within the £200k limit. The rationale correctly identifies the London-specific nature of the PTAL filter.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The high-risk, high-reward strategy is logically sound and the budget is appropriate for the described acquisition attempt. The technical implementation is nearly perfect, but fails on one point.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` values:** The list for the `Use class` filter includes `"Unused land"` and `"Vacant/derelict land"`. These are not valid values for the `Use class` filter, though they may be values for the `Property classification` filter.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Remove `"Unused land"` and `"Vacant/derelict land"` from the `Use class` filter's value list. The `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` filter already captures the desired intent for derelict property.

### Grok_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The precedent-driven approach is technically flawless and financially viable. All filters are correct, exist in the provided documentation, and align with the strategy.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Grok_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The airspace strategy is sound and the capital requirement is within budget. The only flaw is the incorrect syntax and values used in the `Use class` filter.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` values:** The prompt uses abbreviations (e.g., `E`, `E(a)`). It must use the `is one of` operator and the full text descriptions for each class.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Rewrite the `Use class` filter to use the full text descriptions provided in the reference material (e.g., `"E - Commercial, Business and Service"`).

### Grok_Approaches - Approach C: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach targeting distressed assets is both technically and financially valid. The filters are all correct and effectively target the motivation signals described in the rationale. The capital allocation is appropriate for the strategy.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Grok_Critique

### Claude - Approach A: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, units are correct (acres, m), syntax is valid (AND in proposal supported), logical coherence matches strategy (liquidation + stalled planning), capital within £200k, ROI achievable via option exits, implementation viable through direct liquidator contact, deal structure sound (option with contingencies).

### Claude - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist, units correct, syntax valid, logical coherence strong, capital upper end exceeds £200k but phased implementation possible, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.  
**Technical Issues:** PTAL filter London-only, limiting geography.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Use "Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 400" as proxy for non-London areas.

### Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist, units correct, syntax valid, logical coherence strong, capital within £200k, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.  
**Technical Issues:** Requires manual precedent research (not automated in SearchLand).  
**Suggested Fixes:** Automate precedent search via secondary filters or accept manual process.

### Codex - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist, units correct, logical coherence strong, capital within £200k, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.  
**Technical Issues:** Syntax invalid - OR logic in single proposal filter not supported.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Split into separate filters or use AND with specific keywords.

### Codex - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist, units correct, logical coherence strong, capital within £200k, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.  
**Technical Issues:** Syntax invalid - OR logic in single use class filter not supported.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Use "is one of" enum list instead of OR.

### Codex - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist, units correct, logical coherence strong, capital within £200k, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.  
**Technical Issues:** Syntax invalid - OR logic in single use class filter not supported.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Use "is one of" enum list instead of OR.

### Gemini - Approach A: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist, units correct (acres, m), syntax valid (one of for enums), logical coherence matches strategy (off-market + transport proxy), capital within £200k, ROI achievable via planning sale, implementation viable, deal structure sound.

### Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist, units correct, syntax valid, logical coherence strong, capital within £200k, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.  
**Technical Issues:** PTAL filter London-only, limiting geography.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Use "Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 400" as proxy for non-London areas.

### Gemini - Approach C: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist, units correct (acres, m), syntax valid (one of for enums), logical coherence matches strategy (liquidation + derelict), capital within £200k, ROI achievable via JV exit, implementation viable through insolvency specialists, deal structure sound.

### Grok - Approach A: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist, units correct (acres, m), syntax valid (AND in proposal supported), logical coherence matches strategy (precedent + transport), capital within £200k, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.

### Grok - Approach B: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist, units correct (acres, m), syntax valid (one of for enums), logical coherence matches strategy (airspace + corporate), capital within £200k, ROI achievable via JV, implementation viable, deal structure sound.

### Grok - Approach C: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist, units correct (acres, m), syntax valid, logical coherence matches strategy (liquidation + derelict), capital within £200k, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure sound.
