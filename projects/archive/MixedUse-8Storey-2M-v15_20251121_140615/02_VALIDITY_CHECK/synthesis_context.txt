# Synthesis Task

## Your Role
You are the neutral synthesizer. Read all approaches and all critiques, then:

1. **Group Similar Approaches:** Identify natural convergence (LLMs proposing similar strategies)
2. **Preserve Distinct Approaches:** Identify genuinely different strategies worth testing
3. **Apply Critiques:** Use technical feedback to refine approaches
4. **Create Validation Matrix:** Mark each approach VALID/CONDITIONAL/INVALID
5. **Extract Ready-to-Test:** Create clean, executable prompts for SearchLand AI

## Key Principles
- **Preserve diversity:** Don't force convergence - multiple valid approaches can coexist
- **Apply technical fixes:** Use critique feedback to improve approaches
- **Be pragmatic:** CONDITIONAL approaches (minor issues) are still testable
- **Group smartly:** Similar approaches = natural consensus (not forced)

## Output Part 1: Validation Matrix

Create a table:

| Approach | Original LLM | Pattern Used | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| A | Gemini | Pattern X | VALID | Ready to test |
| B | Codex | Pattern Y | CONDITIONAL | Needs unit fix |
| C | Grok | Pattern Z | INVALID | Filter doesn't exist |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Groupings (if applicable):**
- Approaches [A, D, G] are similar (precedent-based) - recommend testing as variants
- Approaches [B, E] both use Pattern X - recommend testing Approach B only (more refined)

## ALL APPROACHES (Original)

### Claude_Approaches

I'll generate 1-3 unique property search strategies based on the comprehensive requirements provided. Let me analyze the key parameters:

**Key Requirements:**
- **Target Profit:** £2,000,000
- **Capital Available:** £200,000
- **Property Type:** 8-storey mixed-use development opportunities
- **Strategy:** Creative structures (options, airspace, JVs) - not direct purchase
- **Planning Precedent:** 8-storey mixed-use (Class E ground + C3 residential above)

**Strategic Approach:**
Given the £200k capital constraint vs £2M profit target (10x ROI), I'll focus on:
1. Option agreements on stalled/expired planning sites
2. Regulation-driven motivation signals
3. Airspace/intensification opportunities

---

## Approach A: Expired High-Rise Consents with Corporate Motivation

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A (Expired Planning) + Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration)  
**Capital Required:** 
- Option fee: £20,000-£40,000
- Legal costs: £10,000-£15,000
- Planning refresh: £30,000-£50,000
- **Total: £60,000-£105,000**

**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties per target geography

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
4. Last application submitted: is before 01/01/2022
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
6. Proposal: contains "storey" AND "mixed"
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. NOT: Flood zone 3
9. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 5
```

**Rationale:**
This approach combines two of the strongest motivation signals from LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:
- **Liquidation/Administration** = forced sale scenario (company legally obligated to dispose of assets)
- **Stalled planning** (applied >3 years ago, <3 apps in 5 years) = previous development intent but failed execution

The filter targets sites where someone already obtained planning for 20+ dwellings with mixed-use elements (indicated by "storey" + "mixed" keywords), but the scheme stalled. A liquidator holding this asset will be highly motivated to accept a low-capital option agreement.

**Strengths:**
- **Maximum motivation:** Liquidation = forced sale, no emotional attachment
- **Planning precedent:** Previous approval shows viability
- **Low capital requirement:** £20k-£40k option secures control
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m train supports high-density development
- **Corporate seller:** Professional decision-maker (faster than private owner)

**Limitations:**
- Very limited pool (liquidations are rare events)
- Planning may have lapsed completely (requires resubmission)
- Site may have underlying issues that caused original failure
- Competition from other opportunistic buyers
- Time-sensitive (liquidators move quickly once decided)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Run SearchLand search, identify 5-10 target sites
2. **Week 3-4:** Land Registry searches, understand liquidation timeline
3. **Week 5-6:** Contact liquidator/administrator directly (not via agent)
4. **Week 7-8:** Negotiate option agreement:
   - £20k-£40k upfront (non-refundable)
   - 18-24 month option period
   - Planning-contingent (can walk away if planning refused)
5. **Month 3-6:** Refresh planning application (use previous consent as precedent)
6. **Month 6-12:** Obtain planning consent
7. **Month 12-18:** Exit to housebuilder (£500k-£2M+ profit depending on location)

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Option fee:** £20k-£40k (10-20% of estimated site value)
- **Legal costs:** £10k-£15k (option agreement, Land Registry, due diligence)
- **Planning costs:** £30k-£50k (architect, planning consultant, application fees)
- **Contingency:** £10k-£20k (surveys, environmental assessments)
- **Total:** £70k-£125k (within £200k budget)

---

## Approach B: Low-Rise in High PTAL Zones with Lease Expiry Motivation

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) + Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry)  
**Capital Required:**
- Airspace rights/JV equity: £50,000-£100,000
- Legal/structural surveys: £20,000-£30,000
- Planning costs: £40,000-£60,000
- **Total: £110,000-£190,000**

**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (London only due to PTAL filter)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 5, 6a, 6b
3. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i)
4. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
5. Lease end date: is between 01/01/2025 AND 31/12/2025
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
7. Freehold tenure: Yes
8. Ownership type: is one of Company
9. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 5
10. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot
```

**Rationale:**
This approach exploits a **perfect storm of opportunity signals**:

1. **Policy support:** PTAL 5-6b = London's highest transport accessibility = local policy supports tall buildings
2. **Height arbitrage:** Current <15m (4-5 storeys) but PTAL supports 8+ storeys = 3-4 storey upside
3. **Structural suitability:** Flat roof = easier airspace addition (lower cost per sqm)
4. **Motivation timing:** Lease expiring in 2025 = landlord facing income cliff in 6-12 months
5. **Negotiation window:** Company owner = professional decision-maker, motivated by cash flow

The £200k capital secures airspace rights or JV equity position rather than freehold purchase.

**Strengths:**
- **Strong planning case:** PTAL 5-6b + existing commercial = mixed-use policy support
- **Timing leverage:** Lease expiry creates predictable motivation (6-12 month window)
- **Structural efficiency:** Flat roof = lower build costs vs pitched roof conversion
- **Commercial ground floor:** Retained = planning gain (mixed-use contribution)
- **Limited leaseholders:** <5 = easier negotiation than 50+ flat owners

**Limitations:**
- **London-only strategy:** PTAL filter restricts to TfL area (high land values)
- **Structural unknowns:** Requires full structural survey (£10k-£20k)
- **Freeholder negotiation:** Must secure airspace rights (not guaranteed)
- **Party wall complications:** Potential disputes with neighbors
- **Planning risk:** Policy support ≠ automatic approval (local objections possible)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Month 1:** Run SearchLand search, identify 10-20 target sites
2. **Month 2:** Desktop due diligence:
   - Land Registry (ownership, charges, restrictions)
   - Local plan (tall building policy zones, Article 4 directions)
   - Planning history (precedent for height in area)
3. **Month 3:** Approach freeholders 6-9 months before lease expiry:
   - "Your tenant's lease expires in 6 months - we can solve your void period"
   - Propose airspace JV or rights purchase
4. **Month 4-5:** Structural survey (£10k-£15k) + negotiate terms:
   - **Option 1 (Airspace Rights):** £50k-£100k for rights to build 3-4 storeys above
   - **Option 2 (JV):** £50k-£100k equity + profit share (60/40 or 70/30)
5. **Month 6-12:** Planning application (8-storey mixed-use):
   - Retain commercial ground floor (Class E)
   - 12-20 residential units above (Class C3)
   - Architect: £20k-£30k
   - Planning consultant: £15k-£25k
   - Application fees: £5k-£10k
6. **Month 12-24:** Exit options:
   - **Sell with planning:** £1M-£2M+ profit (housebuilder/investor)
   - **Build out (if JV):** £500k-£1M profit after build completion

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Airspace rights/JV equity:** £50k-£100k
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£15k
- **Planning costs:** £40k-£60k (architect, consultant, fees)
- **Legal costs:** £10k-£15k (airspace agreement, planning)
- **Contingency:** £10k-£20k
- **Total:** £120k-£210k (upper end requires creative phasing)

---

## Approach C: Precedent-Matching Adjacent Sites with HMO Motivation

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals) + Pattern 8A (HMO License Expiry)  
**Capital Required:**
- Option agreement: £15,000-£30,000
- Legal/due diligence: £10,000-£15,000
- Planning costs: £40,000-£60,000
- **Total: £65,000-£105,000**

**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties (concentrated in urban areas with HMO saturation)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 01/06/2025
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 2
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Ownership type: is one of Private owner, Company
7. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
8. Freehold tenure: Yes
9. Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes
10. NOT: Article 4 directions
```

**Secondary Filter (Adjacent Precedent):**
After identifying HMO sites above, manually search for planning applications within 200m radius containing:
- "8 storey" OR "eight storey"
- "mixed use" OR "mixed-use"
- Decision: Approved (last 3 years)

**Rationale:**
This is the **most sophisticated approach** - combining regulatory pressure with planning precedent:

1. **Forced action:** HMO license expired = cannot operate legally (criminal offense to continue)
2. **Compliance costs:** Renewal = £1k-£3k fees + £10k-£50k building works (fire doors, ensuites, etc.)
3. **Double motivation:** Low EPC (E-G) = also cannot rent until improved (£5k-£50k additional costs)
4. **Tired landlord:** No planning applications in 5 years = passive investor, not developer
5. **Planning precedent:** Nearby 8-storey approval = demonstrates council supports height here
6. **Site assembly:** HMO site + adjacent land = enough area for 8-storey scheme

The strategy is to approach the HMO owner who faces:
- **Option A:** Spend £15k-£100k (renewal + EPC + repairs) to continue low-margin HMO
- **Option B:** Accept £15k-£30k option fee, let you solve the problem with redevelopment

**Strengths:**
- **Triple motivation:** Expired license + Low EPC + Tired landlord = maximum pressure
- **Planning de-risked:** Adjacent 8-storey approval = strong precedent argument
- **Low capital:** £15k-£30k option fee (5-10% of HMO current value)
- **Transport accessibility:** <1km train supports residential density
- **Clear exit:** Precedent proves viability to housebuilder buyer

**Limitations:**
- **Manual work required:** Must research adjacent planning applications (not automated)
- **Site assembly risk:** May need to acquire neighboring plot (complicates deal)
- **Article 4 restrictions:** Some areas prohibit HMO renewals (filter excludes these)
- **Owner psychology:** Tired landlord may just want to sell HMO as-is (not option)
- **Planning not guaranteed:** Precedent helps but not automatic approval

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Run SearchLand search for expired HMO licenses
2. **Week 3-4:** For each result, manually search planning portal within 200m:
   - Look for approved 8-storey mixed-use (last 3 years)
   - Shortlist sites with nearby precedent (expect 30-50% match rate)
3. **Week 5-8:** Desktop due diligence:
   - Land Registry (ownership, site boundaries)
   - Planning history (HMO site + neighbors)
   - Site visit (physical constraints, assembly feasibility)
4. **Month 3-4:** Approach HMO owner (avoid agent - direct letter):
   - "Your HMO license expired 6 months ago - we understand the challenges"
   - "We can offer £20k option fee to solve this problem through redevelopment"
   - Emphasize nearby 8-storey approval (reduces their planning risk perception)
5. **Month 5-8:** Negotiate option agreement:
   - £15k-£30k upfront (based on site value)
   - 24-month option period (longer than Approach A due to assembly risk)
   - Planning-contingent + neighbor assembly contingent
6. **Month 9-12:** Secure any additional land needed (if site assembly required)
7. **Month 12-18:** Planning application (8-storey mixed-use):
   - Use adjacent precedent heavily in design statement
   - Retain some affordable housing (Section 106 gain)
   - Community consultation (address height concerns early)
8. **Month 18-24:** Exit to housebuilder/investor with planning consent

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Option fee (HMO site):** £15k-£30k
- **Neighbor site (if needed):** £20k-£40k (option or small purchase)
- **Legal costs:** £10k-£15k (option agreements, assembly, planning)
- **Planning costs:** £40k-£60k (architect, precedent research, consultant)
- **Surveys:** £10k-£15k (structural, contamination, title investigation)
- **Contingency:** £10k-£20k
- **Total:** £105k-£180k (phased - option first, then planning costs over 12 months)

## Summary Comparison

| Criteria | Approach A (Liquidation) | Approach B (PTAL Airspace) | Approach C (HMO Precedent) |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Capital Required** | £70k-£125k | £120k-£210k | £105k-£180k |
| **Motivation Strength** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Forced sale) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Income cliff) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Triple pressure) |
| **Planning Risk** | Medium (expired consent) | Medium-High (policy support ≠ approval) | Low-Medium (strong precedent) |
| **Expected Results** | 5-15 sites | 10-25 sites (London only) | 15-30 sites |
| **Timeline to Exit** | 12-18 months | 18-24 months | 18-24 months |
| **Profit Potential** | £500k-£2M+ | £1M-£2M+ | £500k-£1.5M |
| **Complexity** | Low (single site) | Medium (structural/airspace) | High (precedent research + assembly) |
| **Best Geography** | UK-wide (Birmingham, Manchester) | London only | Urban areas with HMO saturation |

**Recommendation:**
- **For speed + simplicity:** Approach A (Liquidation)
- **For maximum profit:** Approach B (PTAL Airspace) - London-focused
- **For planning certainty:** Approach C (HMO Precedent) - precedent-backed

All three approaches stay within the £200k capital constraint while targeting the £2M profit goal through 10x ROI structures (options, airspace rights, JVs rather than direct purchase).

### Codex_Approaches

### Approach A: Stalled Mixed-Use Consent Revival
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A – Old Planning + No Recent Activity  
**Capital Required:** £120k option premium securing the title + £50k planning refresh/transport studies + £30k surveys and legal = £200k (control via option/JV, no land purchase)  
**Expected Results:** ~25-40 titles across major UK cores

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 1.5
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use" OR contains "flexible retail" OR contains "8-storey"
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 40
4. Last application submitted: is before 2023-01-01
5. Building on title is inactive: equals Yes
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
7. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 15
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 700
9. Sales listing currently on the market: equals Yes
10. Latest sold date: is before 2018-01-01
```

**Rationale:** Directly mirrors the approved 8-storey mixed-use precedent (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:111) while respecting the £2M profit / £200k capital brief that relies on control strategies rather than purchases (same file:92-99). Using the Proposal, dwelling count, title area, inactivity, and transport filters listed in the ACTUAL SearchLand capabilities ensures every criterion can be implemented (same file:3544-3663, 3708-3799).  
**Strengths:**  
- Recycles already-approved massing, cutting design risk and timeline to the 12-24 month goal (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:100).  
- Inactive titles plus on-market signals highlight motivated sellers suited to optioning.  
- Urban rail proximity underpins the planning case for higher density.

**Limitations:**  
- Requires diligence on why prior consent stalled (viability, covenants).  
- Some consents may have lapsed policy support; revalidation costs must be modeled.

**Implementation Strategy:** Run the filters UK-wide, cluster by local authority, and download application documents to confirm 25-35m envelopes and communal amenity specs from the precedent. Approach owners with option/JV terms sized to cover refresh costs, then target Section 73 or re-submission to reinstate consent before marketing to funding partners.

---

### Approach B: High-PTAL Airspace Retail Stacks
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A – Airspace Development on Flat Roof Stock  
**Capital Required:** £80k airspace option premium + £70k structural/feasibility work (engineer, cost, rights of light) + £50k legal + rights negotiations = £200k  
**Expected Results:** ~50-70 titles in London zones 2-4 and core regional centres

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b) OR E(g)(i)
2. A building in the title has flat roof: equals Yes
3. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 3 AND less than 6
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Number of addresses: is greater than 5
6. Ownership type: is Company
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 400
9. Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m): is less than 150
10. Average footfall count passing title daily: is greater than 6000
11. Sales listing status: equals Available
12. Latest sold date: is before 2017-01-01
```

**Rationale:** Focuses on commercial blocks that already host retail/Class E frontage (line 97) and sit in high-accessibility zones, making vertical extensions for mixed-use logical. Filters rely solely on verified SearchLand parameters such as flat roofs, PTAL proxies, footfall, and transport distances (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3544-3663, 3708-3899).  
**Strengths:**  
- Airspace deals need limited upfront capital yet can add 3-4 storeys to hit the 8-storey target profitably.  
- High footfall corridors provide strong covenant uplift when adding residential above retail.  
- Corporate owners are accustomed to JV structures and portfolio recycling.

**Limitations:**  
- Structural capacity and rights-of-light can kill deals; extra due diligence needed.  
- PTAL data is London-specific, so regional cities require manual confirmation of transport equivalence.

**Implementation Strategy:** Prioritize PTAL 4-6 (or equivalent tram/metro catchments) and map shortlisted titles against borough tall-building policies. Open negotiations for rooftop options, then commission feasibility packs to evidence limited impact on existing retail tenants before packaging the uplift to funding partners.

---

### Approach C: Mot-IV High Street Reinvention
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2C – Inactive Building + Transport Proximity  
**Capital Required:** £60k exclusivity deposit + £90k planning/architect/market studies + £50k JV/legal + stakeholder budgets = £200k  
**Expected Results:** ~70-100 titles, mainly secondary high streets in growth cities

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1
2. Building on title is derelict: equals Yes
3. Ownership type: is Company
4. Sales listing currently on the market: equals Yes
5. Sales listing price: is less than 1000000
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
7. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 25
8. Use class: is B2 OR B8 OR E OR E(g)(iii)
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
10. Average vehicle count passing title daily: is greater than 10000
11. Number of titles owned by company: is greater than 10
```

**Rationale:** Targets corporate-held, derelict edge-of-centre assets with strong traffic counts, enabling creative JV or profit-share deals that match the medium risk appetite and airspace/mixed-use preferences (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:97-100). Filter set sticks to ACTUAL SearchLand fields covering dereliction, ownership, pricing, transport, and motivation metrics (same file:3544-3899).  
**Strengths:**  
- Derelict status plus on-market pricing under £1M gives room to secure options well within £200k.  
- High vehicle counts signal future retail/amenity demand under an 8-storey mixed-use repositioning.  
- Portfolio owners (10+ titles) often divest non-core blocks quickly when offered JV uplift.

**Limitations:**  
- Many assets will require demolition and potential contamination remediation.  
- Some corporate vendors may insist on proof of funds despite JV structure.

**Implementation Strategy:** Filter results, then layer local policy checks (housing delivery tests, tall-building zones) manually. Approach portfolio owners with structured offers—split profit share plus option premium—while running parallel market testing for ground-floor occupiers to validate rent assumptions that underpin the £2M target uplift.

---

All filters referenced above are pulled from the verified SearchLand Available Filters section (01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3544-3899), and each approach aligns with the capital/profit brief and planning precedent described earlier (same file:92-111). Natural next steps: test each filter set in SearchLand, export target lists, and begin outreach for option negotiations.

## Approach A: The Urban Intensification Play

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone & Pattern 4B: Option Agreement Candidates
**Capital Required:** £65,000
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties per major city

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.0
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
4. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or sale of retail goods, other than hot food", "E(c) - Financial and professional services", "E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions", "B2 - General industrial", "B8 - Storage or distribution"
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
8. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
9. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets the precedent by identifying under-developed sites in locations prime for high-density development. It uses transport accessibility (`Distance to nearest Train Station < 800m`) as a proxy for areas where planning policy would support an 8-storey building. The filter for low existing building height (`<15m`) on a reasonably sized plot (`0.2-2.0 acres`) pinpoints sites with significant vertical development potential. By targeting properties with old commercial use classes, long-held ownership (`Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01`), and no recent planning activity, we identify passive owners who may be receptive to an off-market option agreement, fitting our low-capital requirement. This aligns with Pattern 5A (finding low-rise in dense areas) and Pattern 4B (identifying off-market option candidates).

**Strengths:**
- Directly replicates the site characteristics of the successful 8-storey precedent.
- Targets off-market sites, avoiding competition and inflated prices.
- Low capital outlay via an option agreement preserves cash.
- Strong planning argument for uplift based on transport links and housing need.
- Identifies passive owners who are more likely to agree to favorable terms.

**Limitations:**
- Success is dependent on negotiating an option agreement; the owner can refuse.
- Does not use a direct "Tall Building Zone" filter (which doesn't exist), so manual policy review per site is required.
- Planning risk remains; securing an 8-storey consent is not guaranteed.
- The pool of suitable off-market properties is finite.
- Requires a longer time horizon for planning and execution.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search in target cities (Birmingham, Manchester, Slough).
2.  For the top 10-20 results, conduct a desktop planning policy review to confirm local support for height and density.
3.  Identify the legal owner via Land Registry and initiate direct, off-market contact.
4.  Propose an option agreement to purchase the site subject to planning permission for an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.
5.  Negotiate a £50,000 option fee for an 18-24 month period.
6.  Once the option is secured, assemble a design team and submit a full planning application.
7.  Upon receiving planning consent, either exercise the option and develop, or sell the site with planning permission to a larger developer for a profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee (1-2% of agreed purchase price): £50,000
- Legal Fees (for option agreement): £10,000
- Initial Planning & Design Reports: £5,000
- **Total:** £65,000

## Approach B: The Airspace Precedent

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace Development (Flat Roof + Height Headroom)
**Capital Required:** £165,000
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties per major city

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 9 AND less than 18
3. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or sale of retail goods, other than hot food", "E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions"
4. TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of "4", "5", "6a", "6b"
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
6. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
7. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
8. Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building (acres): is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy focuses on creating an 8-storey building by adding 4-5 storeys onto an existing 3-5 storey commercial building, directly addressing the project's height requirement within a low-capital framework. It targets freehold commercial buildings with flat roofs, which are structurally simpler for vertical extensions. The PTAL filter specifically targets London locations where policy strongly supports densification above transport hubs. Filtering for "unbroken" freeholds (`Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1`) is critical, as it eliminates the need for complex negotiations with multiple leaseholders, leaving only the building owner to deal with for the airspace rights. This aligns perfectly with Pattern 6A and the capital constraints.

**Strengths:**
- Most capital-efficient path to creating an 8-storey building.
- Utilizes existing structure, foundations, and services, reducing construction costs.
- PTAL filter provides a strong, data-driven proxy for policy support for height in London.
- Targeting unbroken freeholds dramatically simplifies the legal and negotiation process.
- Potential to generate income from the lower commercial floors during construction.

**Limitations:**
- PTAL filter is London-specific; for other cities, `Distance to nearest Train Station (m)` must be used as a substitute.
- A detailed structural survey is required to confirm the existing building can support additional floors, which can be costly and may reveal issues.
- Right-to-light issues with neighbouring properties can be a major obstacle.
- The cost of purchasing airspace rights can be significant.
- Construction logistics in dense urban areas are complex.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search across London boroughs with high PTAL values.
2.  Shortlist properties and conduct an initial desktop structural and right-to-light analysis.
3.  Approach the freehold owner to negotiate the purchase of the airspace rights.
4.  Structure a deal to acquire the rights for a fee, potentially with an overage clause based on the number of units achieved.
5.  Engage architects and structural engineers to design the vertical extension.
6.  Submit a planning application for the additional storeys.
7.  Post-consent, either develop the scheme or sell the site with the rights and planning approval.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Airspace Rights Purchase Deposit: £125,000
- Structural Engineer & Architect Feasibility Reports: £25,000
- Legal Fees (for airspace deed): £15,000
- **Total:** £165,000

## Approach C: The Distressed Asset Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D: Liquidation/Administration Sales
**Capital Required:** £200,000
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties UK-wide

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of "Liquidation", "In Administration"
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.0
4. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "B2 - General industrial", "B8 - Storage or distribution", "Unused land", "Vacant/derelict land"
5. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
7. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:**
This approach leverages an extreme motivation signal to acquire a suitable site at a significant discount, potentially allowing for a direct purchase within the £200k capital limit. As identified in `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`, companies in liquidation are legally forced to sell assets quickly. By combining this with a `Building on title is derelict` filter, we target non-performing, burdensome assets that liquidators will be highly motivated to dispose of for a low price. The search focuses on appropriately sized plots (`0.2-2.0 acres`) with prior commercial use and transport links, ensuring they have underlying potential for a mixed-use redevelopment scheme that could align with the 8-storey precedent. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy based on Pattern 2D.

**Strengths:**
- Targets the strongest possible seller motivation, creating significant buyer leverage.
- Potential to acquire a freehold site directly for a price well below market value.
- Quick transaction timelines are often preferred by liquidators.
- Reduced competition, as many developers avoid complex distressed asset sales.
- The derelict status strengthens the planning argument for demolition and comprehensive redevelopment.

**Limitations:**
- The number of available properties is extremely low.
- Properties may have significant hidden liabilities, contamination, or legal issues.
- Requires a cash purchase or specialist financing; traditional mortgages are not an option.
- The £200k budget may still be insufficient even with a discount, depending on location.
- The process can be legally complex, requiring specialist advice.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search UK-wide, focusing on the outskirts of major urban centres where land values are lower.
2.  Immediately engage a solicitor specializing in insolvency and property upon identifying a target.
3.  Conduct rapid due diligence, including a desktop environmental search and planning review.
4.  Submit a simple, unconditional cash offer to the appointed liquidator/administrator, emphasizing speed of completion.
5.  Use the £200k as the full purchase price for a smaller site, or as a deposit to secure a larger site with deferred payment terms.
6.  Once acquired, the "dirty" site is a prime candidate for a JV with a developer, or can be taken through the planning process before being sold on.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Site Acquisition (all-cash offer): £170,000
- Legal Fees (insolvency specialist): £15,000
- Phase 1 Environmental & Site Surveys: £10,000
- Insurance & Holding Costs: £5,000
- **Total:** £200,000

### Grok_Approaches

## Approach A: Precedent-Driven Mixed-Use Intensification

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A: Similar planning approvals (8-storey mixed-use)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000-£200,000 (option agreements £50k-£100k, planning costs £50k-£100k)  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "8-storey" AND "mixed-use"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with recent planning approvals for 8-storey mixed-use developments similar to the Slough precedent, focusing on urban locations with transport accessibility and no green belt constraints. By identifying sites where similar schemes have been approved, we reduce planning risk while leveraging precedent analysis to demonstrate viability.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent reduces planning uncertainty
- Urban transport proximity supports density
- Inactive buildings indicate redevelopment potential
- Recent approvals (2020+) show current policy support

**Limitations:**
- Limited to sites with existing approvals (not new opportunities)
- May face competition from other developers
- Requires detailed precedent research
- Transport filters may exclude some viable sites

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify approved 8-storey mixed-use sites
2. Research planning applications for key success factors (height, use mix, amenity)
3. Secure option agreements (£50k-£100k) on similar sites without planning
4. Apply for planning using precedents, targeting 25-35m height with retail ground floor
5. Negotiate airspace rights or direct purchase within £200k budget
6. Exit via planning permission sale to housebuilder

## Approach B: Capital-Efficient Airspace Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, £50k-£150k rights)  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£150,000 (airspace rights £50k-£100k, option deposits £10k-£50k)  
**Expected Results:** 30-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
6. Ownership type: is equal to Company
7. Latest sold date: is before 2019-01-01
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy exploits airspace development potential on existing commercial buildings in urban areas with transport links, targeting corporate owners with long hold periods who may be motivated to monetize unused roof space. The approach fits within £200k capital by focusing on airspace rights rather than full acquisition, enabling 8-storey additions above existing structures.

**Strengths:**
- Low upfront capital via airspace rights
- Existing utilities and access reduce development costs
- Corporate owners often open to creative structures
- Transport proximity supports residential viability

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural engineering assessment
- Freeholder negotiation can be complex
- May face leaseholder objections
- Planning for height additions still required

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify flat-roof commercial buildings under 15m height
2. Research freeholder ownership and approach with airspace proposal
3. Secure option agreements (£10k-£50k) for airspace rights (£50k-£100k)
4. Conduct structural surveys and obtain planning for 4-6 storey residential addition
5. Structure deal as airspace lease or sale with overage on future development
6. Partner with residential developer for construction financing

## Approach C: Regulation-Driven Legacy Holdings

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2A: Long corporate hold + derelict asset  
**Capital Required:** £80,000-£120,000 (option agreements £20k-£50k, acquisition £50k-£100k)  
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 1.5
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
7. Company status: is one of Liquidation
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets corporate-owned derelict assets held for over 10 years with minimal recent activity, leveraging liquidation status as a strong motivation signal. By focusing on sites suitable for mixed-use redevelopment near transport, we identify motivated sellers willing to accept creative capital structures within the £200k budget.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation from liquidation status
- Derelict condition justifies low pricing
- Long corporate hold indicates non-core asset
- Transport proximity supports 8-storey density

**Limitations:**
- Liquidation properties may have complex legal issues
- Derelict sites require remediation costs
- Limited pool of liquidation cases
- May require distressed asset expertise

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for liquidation companies with derelict long-hold assets
2. Verify site suitability for 8-storey mixed-use via precedent analysis
3. Approach liquidators with option proposals (£20k-£50k deposits)
4. Secure planning for demolition and 8-storey rebuild with retail ground floor
5. Structure acquisition within £100k-£150k total capital
6. Exit via planning permission sale or direct development with JV partner

## DETAILED FINDINGS BY LLM

### 🥇 GEMINI - 100% Valid Rate (Best Technical Execution)

#### **Approach A: Urban Intensification** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £65k (32.5% of budget - MOST EFFICIENT!)
- **Technical:** Flawless - correct enum syntax, proper filter names
- **Business:** Off-market targeting, 10-year hold motivation, solid £500k-£1.5M profit potential
- **Minor note:** Expected results may be lower end of stated range (restrictive filters)

#### **Approach B: Airspace Precedent** - ✅ **VALID** 
- **Capital:** £165k (82.5%)
- **Technical:** Perfect - best airspace approach in entire review
- **Business:** London PTAL 4-6b targeting, "unbroken freehold" (<1 leaseholder) is sophisticated
- **ROI:** £1M-£2M+ realistic for London airspace
- **Strategic note:** Technically the best-executed approach overall

#### **Approach C: Distressed Asset** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £200k (100% - aggressive)
- **Technical:** Flawless syntax, correct liquidation enum values
- **Business:** High-risk/high-reward acknowledged, includes specialist legal costs
- **Minor note:** Liquidation properties rare (may be 0-5 results, not 5-15 as stated)

---

### 🥈 GROK - 67% Valid Rate (Strong Execution)

#### **Approach B: Capital-Efficient Airspace** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £100k-£150k (50-75%)
- **Technical:** Clean, flawless execution
- **Business:** UK-wide airspace, corporate targeting, 6+ year holds
- **Strategic note:** One of the cleanest approaches in entire review

#### **Approach C: Regulation-Driven Legacy** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £80k-£120k (40-60%)
- **Technical:** Perfect - triple motivation signals elegantly combined
- **Business:** Liquidation + derelict + 10-year hold = maximum pressure
- **Strategic note:** One of the strongest overall approaches

#### **Approach A: Precedent-Driven** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Capital:** £150k-£200k
- **Issue:** Date filter ambiguity - "Last application: is after 2020-01-01" finds sites WITH recent approvals, but implementation says "sites WITHOUT planning"
- **Fix:** Clarify if this is (1) research phase (find precedents) or (2) execution phase (find opportunities)
- **Suggested:** Split into 2-stage process OR invert date filter to "is before 2020-01-01"

---

### 🥈 CLAUDE - 67% Valid Rate (Strong Strategic Thinking)

#### **Approach A: Expired High-Rise (Liquidation)** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £70k-£125k (35-62.5%)
- **Technical:** Excellent - all filters valid, correct syntax
- **Business:** Liquidation = forced sale (strongest motivation), planning precedent reduces risk
- **Minor note:** Expected results (5-15) may be optimistic - liquidations are rare events

#### **Approach B: Low-Rise PTAL (Airspace)** - ✅ **VALID**
- **Capital:** £110k-£190k (55-95%)
- **Technical:** Valid with minor clarifications (filter names standardization)
- **Business:** PTAL 5-6b + lease expiry = strong timing pressure, £1M-£2M+ ROI realistic
- **Minor note:** Upper capital limit (£190k) is 95% of budget - tight

#### **Approach C: HMO Precedent** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Capital:** £65k-£105k (32.5-52.5%)
- **Issues:** 3 syntax corrections needed:
  1. "Currently has HMO: Yes" → "Has an HMO: is equal to Yes"
  2. "Freehold tenure: Yes" → "Tenure: is equal to Freehold"  
  3. "Less than 1 application: Yes" → "Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1"
- **Business:** Triple motivation (expired HMO + low EPC + tired landlord) = powerful
- **Strategic note:** Most sophisticated approach - manual precedent research is feature, not bug

---

### 🔴 CODEX - 0% Valid Rate (Requires Systematic Fixes)

**Common Issue Across All 3 Approaches:** Incorrect OR logic syntax
- Used: `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b)` ❌
- Should be: `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial...", "E(a) - Display...", etc.` ✅

SearchLand does NOT support OR within single filter - must use **"is one of"** with full enum names.

#### **Approach A: Stalled Mixed-Use** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:** 
  - Filter #2: OR logic in Proposal field (must use AND keywords instead)
  - Filters #5, #9: "equals Yes" should be "is equal to Yes"
- **Strategy:** Sound (Pattern 1A: Old Planning + No Recent Activity)
- **Fix difficulty:** Low (5-10 min)

#### **Approach B: High-PTAL Airspace** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:**
  - Filter #1: OR logic in Use class (must use "is one of" with full names)
  - Filter #11: "Sales listing status: equals Available" should be "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
  - Filters #2, #6: syntax corrections
- **Strategy:** Strong (high-footfall targeting is sophisticated)
- **Fix difficulty:** Medium (15-20 min - requires full enum names)

#### **Approach C: High Street Reinvention** - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**
- **Issues:**
  - Filter #8: OR logic in Use class (must use "is one of")
  - Filters #2, #3, #4: "equals" should be "is equal to"
- **Strategy:** Solid (vehicle count + portfolio targeting is clever)
- **Fix difficulty:** Medium (15-20 min)

---

## CRITICAL TECHNICAL LEARNINGS

### 1. **OR Logic Does NOT Work in SearchLand** ❌
**Wrong:** `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b)`  
**Right:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or sale..."`

### 2. **Enum Names: Use Full Names (Best Practice)**
- Gemini consistently used full enum names ✅
- Grok used short codes (E, E(a)) - acceptable but risky
- Codex attempted OR logic - caused all failures

### 3. **Filter Name Precision Matters**
- "Currently has HMO" ❌ → "Has an HMO" ✅
- "Freehold tenure: Yes" ❌ → "Tenure: is equal to Freehold" ✅
- Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md for exact names

### 4. **All Approaches Correctly Handled:**
- ✅ Date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ✅ Unit conversions (acres not sqm, metres not feet)
- ✅ AND logic within fields
- ✅ Numeric ranges

### Codex_Critique

### Claude - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters mostly align with the brief and capital/ROI are plausible, but one of the required exclusions cannot be implemented in SearchLand as written.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `NOT: Flood zone 3` is not an actual filter. Flood-risk exclusions must be expressed via the coverage/area metrics listed in the verified filter set (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:81; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3628).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace the invalid clause with `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0` (or the “area not covered” equivalent) so that the search can run.
- Keep the rest of the structure as-is once the filter is corrected; ROI and capital logic already line up with the £2M/£200k brief.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Strong combination of liquidation pressure and lapsed consents should keep motivation high once the syntax is fixed.

---

### Claude - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Targeting PTAL-backed flat roofs with lease expiries is coherent, but both the exclusion syntax and the top-end capital draw exceed project constraints.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot` cannot be parsed; only the specific coverage/distance filters are available (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:149; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3626 and 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3632).
- The capital line item allows spend up to £210k, which breaches the £200k limit this project set (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:205).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Swap the invalid `NOT` clause for `Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0` plus `Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building (acres): is equal to 0`.
- Trim or defer at least £10k of the planning/legal stack (e.g., vendor-funded surveys or staged option payments) so the high case still fits within £200k.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Lease expiries plus PTAL effectively target the policy support window once the syntax/budget issues are resolved.

---

### Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The regulatory-pressure concept is sound, but two filters are formatted in ways SearchLand cannot execute.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes` is not a valid field; the platform exposes `Applications in the last 5 years` which needs an explicit numeric comparison (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:230; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3581).
- `NOT: Article 4 directions` is not supported; you must reference `Article 4` or its percentage coverage field instead (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:231; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3637).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Rewrite the activity filter as `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`.
- Replace the Article 4 exclusion with `Article 4: is equal to No` or `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0`.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Once the filters work, the three-pronged motivation (HMO licence, EPC, precedent) remains a high-leverage play.

---

### Codex - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The stalled-consent search logic is implementable, but the write-up never shows how the scheme delivers the £2M profit requirement, leaving the business case unproven.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The section outlines filters and process only (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:327) and does not include any GDV/exit comparison or residual that demonstrates a >£2M target uplift.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add a simple residual or precedent sale calculation (units x £/sqft minus build/refresh costs) showing that reviving and trading one of these consents can realistically clear £2M.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Recycling stalled consents is inherently efficient once ROI evidence is documented.

---

### Codex - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The airspace retail stack concept fits the mandate, but the SearchLand syntax is incorrect and the ROI story is absent.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Use class: is E OR E(a) OR E(b) OR E(g)(i)` is invalid—the platform expects the `is one of` syntax shown in the filter reference (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:367; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:810).
- No profitability or exit evidence is provided for this pathway (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:360).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Reformat the use-class line as `Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i)`.
- Add an outline showing how many units or sqft you can stack on these roofs and the resulting margin to prove the £2M target is attainable.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- High-footfall London corridors are sensible once the prompt syntax and ROI are clarified.

---

### Codex - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Motivated high-street reinvention is appealing, but the same syntax/ROI gaps recur.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Use class: is B2 OR B8 OR E OR E(g)(iii)` needs the `is one of` structure to run (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:409; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:810).
- There is no calculation showing how the JV/option structure generates the £2M profit target (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:395).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Rewrite the use-class filter as `Use class: is one of B2, B8, E, E(g)(iii)`.
- Include either a precedent GDV uplift (traffic-linked rents + added storeys) or a residual that demonstrates the stated profit ambition.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Portfolio disposals with derelict stock should stay in scope once the prompt and economics are tightened.

---

### Gemini - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The search profile suits the brief, but the capital plan underestimates planning costs and the ROI story is missing.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Only £5k is earmarked for “initial planning & design reports” despite 8-storey applications elsewhere in the same pack needing £40k-£60k of professional spend (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:484 vs. 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:200). This makes the capital plan non-credible.
- No exit/profit calculation is provided for the option exercise (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:435).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Rebase the budget to include at least £40k-£60k for architecture, planning consultancy, and fees, even if staged.
- Add a simple residual (e.g., 40 units × £X margin) showing the >£2M upside once planning is secured.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Off-market low-rise stock near transport remains a useful channel once the numbers are realistic.

---

### Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters are technically valid, but the approach never demonstrates that stacking airspace will reach the £2M target.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The entire section (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:488) omits GDV, unit counts, or any ROI evidence, so the business case cannot be validated.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add a London PTAL case study quantifying the additional floorspace, build cost, and likely disposal value to confirm a >£2M margin.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Freehold-only airspace deals are attractive once profitability is proven.

---

### Gemini - Approach C: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** The plan assumes the whole £200k can buy a 0.2–2 acre derelict mixed-use site outright, leaving no funding for planning or enabling work, and it still omits any ROI maths.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The capital plan spends £170k on acquisition plus £30k on fees/holding, with zero allowance for the surveys, architects, or planning fees needed for an 8-storey consent (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:582). That makes implementation impossible within budget.
- No profit or exit projection is offered for the strategy (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:538).

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Reframe this as an option/JV (instead of an outright purchase) with staged spend and explicit residuals if you want it back on the table.

---

### Grok - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The idea of piggybacking on recent approvals is solid, but SearchLand cannot filter by planning decision status, so the automation claim is overstated and ROI is still missing.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- SearchLand has no “planning status = approved” filter, so the prompt cannot guarantee you’re only seeing approvals; the plan needs a manual check phase (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:609; 01_DIVERGENT_GENERATION/shared_context.txt:3587).
- There is no quantified profitability path in this section (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:592).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Explicitly add a manual validation step (e.g., download decisions) after running the keyword search.
- Provide a precedent sale/option uplift that demonstrates the >£2M target.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Still a good framework for “precedent-led” outreach once validation and ROI are added.

---

### Grok - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The airspace filters are precise, yet the narrative never proves the capital stack results in a £2M profit.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The section lays out filters and implementation only (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:632) with no GDV/ROI evidence tied to the £2M requirement.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Provide an example (e.g., add 4 storeys of 20 units × £100k margin) to validate the target profit.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Broadening beyond London via transport proxies could keep funnel sizes healthy once ROI is documented.

---

### Grok - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Long-held derelict corporate assets in liquidation match the mandate, but profitability is again undocumented.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The write-up (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:672) describes filters, rationale, and process but never quantifies how the £80k-£120k control spend becomes a £2M profit.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Include a sample valuation uplift (e.g., acquisition discount vs. post-planning exit) to evidence ROI, and ensure any remediation/planning costs are accounted for.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Combining liquidation and dereliction is powerful once the economic model is explicit.

---

**Next steps:** Once each team updates its filter syntax, capital allocation, and ROI evidence per the notes above, rerun the SearchLand prompts to confirm they execute cleanly and document at least one £2M+ residual per approach.

### Gemini_Critique

Loaded cached credentials.
Here is the technical and business case validity review of all submitted approaches.

### Claude_Approaches - Approach A: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The approach is strategically sound and financially viable within the stated budget. However, it uses invalid syntax for filtering out constraints.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid Filter Syntax:** The prompt uses `NOT: Flood zone 3`. This is not a valid SearchLand filter.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Replace `NOT: Flood zone 3` with `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0`.
- Ensure date format is `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2022-01-01`).

### Claude_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is strong, targeting a clear opportunity. The capital allocation is within budget. However, the prompt contains multiple technical errors regarding filter names, values, and syntax.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` values:** The prompt uses abbreviations (e.g., `E`, `E(a)`). It must use the full text descriptions (e.g., `"E - Commercial, Business and Service"`).
- **Invalid `Tenure` filter:** The prompt uses `Freehold tenure: Yes`. The correct filter is `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`.
- **Invalid Constraint Syntax:** The prompt uses `NOT: Conservation area, Listed building(s) in plot`. This is not valid.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Correct the `Use class` filter to use `is one of` with the full, exact text for each class.
- Change `Freehold tenure: Yes` to `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`.
- Replace the `NOT` filter with two separate filters: `Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0` AND `Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building (acres): is equal to 0`.
- Ensure date formats are `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Claude_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** This is a sophisticated and well-reasoned strategy with a high potential for success. The budget is appropriate. However, like the other Claude approaches, it suffers from numerous technical filter implementation errors.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid Filter Name:** `Currently has HMO: Yes` should be `Has an HMO: is equal to Yes`.
- **Invalid `Tenure` filter:** `Freehold tenure: Yes` should be `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`.
- **Invalid Application Filter:** `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes` should be `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`.
- **Invalid Constraint Syntax:** `NOT: Article 4 directions` is not a valid filter.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Correct all filter names and values as listed above.
- Replace `NOT: Article 4 directions` with `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0`.
- Ensure date format is `YYYY-MM-DD`.

---
### Codex_Approaches - Approach A: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is valid and the budget is feasible. The core technical issue is the use of "OR" logic within a single filter field, which is not supported by SearchLand.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Proposal` Syntax:** The prompt `Proposal: contains "mixed use" OR contains "flexible retail" OR contains "8-storey"` is invalid. SearchLand does not support `OR` logic within a single text field.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- This requires creating three separate, identical filter groups and connecting them with an "OR" condition at the group level. Each group would contain all the filters, but with a different `Proposal` keyword (one for "mixed use", one for "flexible retail", one for "8-storey").

### Codex_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The airspace strategy is financially sound and well-targeted. The only issue is the technically incorrect formatting of the `Use class` filter.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` Syntax:** The prompt uses `is E OR E(a) OR E(b) OR E(g)(i)`. This is invalid. It requires the `is one of` operator and the full text descriptions for each class.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Rewrite the filter as: `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "E(a) - Display or sale of retail goods, other than hot food", ...` including the full text for all desired classes.

### Codex_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy targeting derelict, corporate-owned assets is viable and the budget is appropriate. The implementation is flawed only by the incorrect `Use class` filter syntax.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` Syntax:** The prompt uses `is B2 OR B8 OR E OR E(g)(iii)`. This is invalid.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Rewrite the filter using the `is one of` operator and the full text descriptions for each class (e.g., `"B2 - General industrial"`).

---
### Gemini_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is technically and financially sound. All filters exist, use correct syntax and units, and logically cohere with the stated off-market strategy. The capital requirement is well within budget.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a well-constructed airspace strategy. All filters are valid and correctly implemented. The capital breakdown is realistic and within the £200k limit. The rationale correctly identifies the London-specific nature of the PTAL filter.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The high-risk, high-reward strategy is logically sound and the budget is appropriate for the described acquisition attempt. The technical implementation is nearly perfect, but fails on one point.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` values:** The list for the `Use class` filter includes `"Unused land"` and `"Vacant/derelict land"`. These are not valid values for the `Use class` filter, though they may be values for the `Property classification` filter.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Remove `"Unused land"` and `"Vacant/derelict land"` from the `Use class` filter's value list. The `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` filter already captures the desired intent for derelict property.

---
### Grok_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The precedent-driven approach is technically flawless and financially viable. All filters are correct, exist in the provided documentation, and align with the strategy.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

### Grok_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The airspace strategy is sound and the capital requirement is within budget. The only flaw is the incorrect syntax and values used in the `Use class` filter.

**Technical Issues:**
- **Invalid `Use class` values:** The prompt uses abbreviations (e.g., `E`, `E(a)`). It must use the `is one of` operator and the full text descriptions for each class.

**Suggested Fixes:**
- Rewrite the `Use class` filter to use the full text descriptions provided in the reference material (e.g., `"E - Commercial, Business and Service"`).

### Grok_Approaches - Approach C: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach targeting distressed assets is both technically and financially valid. The filters are all correct and effectively target the motivation signals described in the rationale. The capital allocation is appropriate for the strategy.

**Technical Issues:**
- None.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)
```

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

Example:

## 1. Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies

### Pattern A: Old Planning + No Recent Activity
```
Strategy: Find sites with old planning applications and no recent development activity
Indicators:
- Last application submitted: >2-3 years ago
- Applications in last 5 years: <3
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Max number of dwellings applied for: >0 (confirms development intent)

Strengths: Targets sites where planning work already done but stalled
Weaknesses: May miss sites with expired planning but recent resubmissions
Capital requirement: Varies (often requires on-market listing filter)
```

### Pattern B: Proposal Keyword + Inactive Building
```
Strategy: Search for specific development types with inactive buildings
Indicators:
- Proposal: contains "[development type]" keywords
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Title area: appropriate size for target development

Strengths: More flexible than date-based approaches
Weaknesses: Doesn't confirm planning has actually lapsed
Capital requirement: Add price filters as needed
```

```
Strategy: Corporate owners holding derelict assets for 5+ years
Indicators:
- Ownership type: Company
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago
- Building on title is derelict: Yes
- Optional: Sales listing currently on the market: Yes

Strengths: Strong motivation signals (asset write-down, non-core holding)
Weaknesses: Limited pool of properties
Capital requirement: Often suitable for low-capital strategies
```

### Pattern B: Long Market Listing + Price Cap
```
Strategy: Properties listed for extended periods with price constraints
Indicators:

- Latest sold date: >3-5 years ago (long hold)

Strengths: Active sellers with demonstrated motivation
Weaknesses: Cannot directly filter for "time on market"
Capital requirement: Directly constrained by price filter
```

### Pattern C: Inactive Building + Transport Proximity
```
Strategy: Inactive/derelict properties near transport (redevelopment angle)
Indicators:
- Building on title is inactive OR derelict: Yes
- Distance to nearest Train Station: <500-1000m
- Title area: appropriate size

Strengths: Combines motivation with development rationale
Weaknesses: Transport proximity doesn't guarantee motivation
Capital requirement: Add price filters for low-capital approaches
```

## Collaborative Round Guide 🔄

Maps patterns to exploration rounds in the v3.2.0 workflow:

### Round 2: Precedent Analysis
**Goal:** Which patterns help replicate successful planning applications?
- Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning (find similar approved schemes)
- Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (PTAL matching)
- Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly (precedent for infill)
- Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion (prior approvals)

**Why these patterns?** These rely on demonstrating that similar developments have been approved nearby or on similar sites. Success depends on finding comparable precedents.

### Round 3: Regulation-Driven
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit regulatory drivers and deadlines?
- Pattern 7: Permitted Development (Class AA, Q, MA, ZA rights)
- Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Article 4, expiring conditions)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (enforcement, S215 notices)

**Why these patterns?** These opportunities are created by regulatory changes, deadlines, or enforcement actions that create urgency or unlock new rights.

### Round 4: Structural Arbitrage
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit physical characteristics and constraints?
- Pattern 6: Airspace Development (roof extensions, party wall arbitrage)
- Pattern 9: Green Belt/Strategic Land (boundary anomalies, brownfield)
- Pattern 3: Underutilized/Inefficient Sites (layout inefficiencies)
- Pattern 4: Title/Access Issues (ransom strips, easements)

**Why these patterns?** These exploit physical, spatial, or legal constraints that others overlook or cannot solve. Value creation comes from structural problem-solving.

### Round 5: Behavioral/Motivation
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit seller motivation and market timing?
- Pattern 2: Motivated Seller (estate settlements, divorces, financial distress)
- Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage (Advanced Workflow) (emerging allocations, infrastructure announcements)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (combined with motivation)

**Why these patterns?** These depend on understanding seller psychology, market inefficiencies, and information asymmetries. Success requires empathy and timing.

### Cross-Round Patterns
Some patterns work across multiple rounds:
- **Pattern 11** (Distressed Assets): Regulation-driven (enforcement) + Behavioral (motivated seller)
- **Pattern 1** (Expired Planning): Precedent Analysis (prior approval) + Behavioral (frustrated owner)
- **Pattern 13** (Time Arbitrage): Regulation-Driven (policy changes) + Behavioral (information gaps)
```

## 4. Low Capital Entry Strategies

**NOTE:** Enhanced in v2.1 based on Codex review - added concrete filter examples for executability

### Pattern A: Sub-£200k Direct Purchase
```
Strategy: Direct freehold/leasehold purchase under capital limit
Source: User strategy (no direct preset)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Sales listing price: is less than £200,000
2. Tenure: Freehold
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
4. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
5. Use class: Contains "Residential" OR "Mixed"
6. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3

Indicators:
- Sales listing price: <£200,000 (adjust to your capital)
- Tenure: Freehold (avoid leasehold complications)
- Title area: 0.1-0.5 acres (adequate size without excess land cost)
- On market: Yes (immediate availability)

Strengths: Direct acquisition within budget, clear pricing
Weaknesses: Very limited supply; may sacrifice quality/location
Capital requirement: Hard cap at budget limit (£10k-£200k typical)
```

### Pattern B: Option Agreement Candidates
```
Strategy: Higher-value sites suitable for option agreements (low upfront capital)
Source: User strategy + Pattern 2 (Motivated Seller) overlap

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Latest sold date: No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
2. Ownership type: Private owner OR Company
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no recent activity)
5. NOT: Sales listing currently on the market (off-market approach)
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago OR never sold (motivated seller potential)
- Ownership type: Private owner or Company (institutional negotiation)
- Title area: 1-10 acres (large enough for phased development)
- No recent applications (owner not actively developing)
- OFF-MARKET (no listing price filter - approach directly)

Strengths: Access to better sites with low initial capital (£10k-£50k option fee)
Weaknesses: Requires negotiation skills, legal costs, seller must agree
Capital requirement: £10k-£50k for option + £5k-£15k legals

Strategy Steps:
1. Identify site via filters above
2. Research title owner (Land Registry)
3. Approach with option proposal (planning-contingent)
4. Secure option for 12-24 months
5. Apply for planning or sell option to developer
```

### Pattern C: Derelict Asset Turnaround
```
Strategy: Severely derelict properties with rebuild/redevelopment angle
Source: User strategy + Pattern 2C (Motivated Seller) overlap

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Building on title is derelict: Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than £150,000 (adjust to budget - acquisition costs)
3. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 1000m (exit value/marketability)
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
5. Tenure: Freehold
6. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building (reduces complexity)

Indicators:
- Building derelict: Yes (distressed pricing)
- Listing price: <£150k (allows rebuild budget)
- Transport proximity: <1km train station (residential appeal)
- Title area: 0.05-0.25 acres (adequate but not excessive)
- Avoid conservation/listed (planning complexity)

Strengths: Discounted pricing, high upside potential (buy £100k, rebuild £100k, sell £300k)
Weaknesses: Requires construction expertise, hidden structural issues, planning risk
Capital requirement: 
- Acquisition: £50k-£150k
- Demolition: £10k-£30k
- Rebuild: £100k-£200k
- Total: £160k-£380k (phase if needed)

## 9. Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: Grey Belt Exception
```
Strategy: Previously developed land in Green Belt (exception to protection)
Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

Strengths:
- Access to Green Belt locations (often cheaper)
- Exception to normal GB restrictions
- Less competition (many avoid GB entirely)

Weaknesses:
- Still needs planning (not automatic)
- Local opposition possible
- Must prove "previously developed"

Capital requirement: Often cheaper than pure urban (£50k-£300k)

Example Filters:

Grey Belt (Preset #7):
1. Freehold tenure
2. More than 25% area developed
3. More than 10% hardstanding (key indicator)
4. Within 100m of built up area
5. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3, National parks, Conservation area, etc.
6. 1,000+ sqmt

Grey Belt Low Impact (Preset #44):
1. Green Belt Review score: 1 or 2 (low environmental impact)
2. More than 25% hardstanding
3. Within 100m of built up area
4. NOT: Flood zone 3, Conservation area, AONB

Strategic Insight:
"Previously developed land in Green Belt" = exception
Hardstanding % = proxy for "previously developed"

Related: Presets #7, #43, #44, #45 (GB solar)
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "Hardstanding percentage"

- NOT SHLAA assessed OR negative (hidden gems)
- Private owner (easier to deal)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 5% developed (undeveloped land)

Strategic Rationale:
- Local authorities review settlement boundaries periodically
- Sites on edges = natural expansion direction
- No SHLAA = no one else promoting (first mover advantage)
- Promote to get allocated in next local plan

Strengths:
- Lower competition (undiscovered)
- Can influence local plan
- Option agreements with minimal capital
- Value jump when allocated

Weaknesses:
- Long timeline (2-5 years for allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation
- Requires planning expertise

Capital requirement: Low for option (£5k-£50k), patient capital

Example Filters:

Edge of Settlement (Preset #18):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Private owner ownership
3. 1,000-8,000 sqmt
4. Less than 5% area developed
5. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no activity)
6. No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
7. 1-10% built up area coverage (edge location)
8. More than 80% un-constrained

Un-Allocated No SHLAA (Preset #85):
1. NOT SHLAA positive/neutral/negative (not assessed!)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m of settlement boundary
4. Company or private owner
5. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)

Strategy:
1. Identify edge-of-settlement sites
2. Secure option agreement (low capital)
3. Promote to local authority (planning consultancy)
4. Get allocated in local plan
5. Apply for planning permission
6. Exit to housebuilder

**Possible Approach Combinations:**

1. **Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A) + Motivated Seller (Pattern 2A)**
   - Find stalled mixed-use planning with corporate seller motivation
   - Low acquisition cost, planning precedent exists
   - Capital: option agreement or distressed purchase

2. **Under-Developed (Pattern 3A) + Airspace (Pattern 6A)**
   - High PTAL, flat roof, existing low-rise
   - Add 4-6 storeys of residential above
   - Capital: airspace rights + construction finance

3. **Derelict Turnaround (Pattern 4C) + Height Intensification (Pattern 5A)**
   - Derelict building in tall building zone
   - Demolish + rebuild to 8 storeys
   - Capital: acquisition + phased construction

# ADVANCED WORKFLOW

_This section contains meta-strategies that sit on top of the filter patterns._

---

## ⭐ HIGHEST ROI STRATEGY (Per Stage 2 Review)

**Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage)** has been relocated to this Advanced Workflow section because it is a **workflow process** rather than a filter pattern. However, peer reviews confirm it is **one of the HIGHEST ROI strategies**:

- **Grok (Stage 2):** Ranked #1 - "Force multiplier that converts SearchLand's 24-hour refresh into unique deal flow"
- **Codex (Stage 1):** Ranked #3 - "High ROI, needs tooling but strategic advantage"
- **Gemini (Stage 1):** Ranked #2 - "Brilliant concept, A-grade strategic value"

**Strategic Philosophy Difference:**
- **Speed/Timing Lens (Grok):** Time arbitrage = highest priority (be first to act)
- **Certainty Lens (Gemini/Codex):** Regulation-driven = highest priority (predictable triggers)
- **Both valid:** Choose based on your competitive advantage (speed vs. process)

**What Makes This Different:**
This is a **FORCE MULTIPLIER** - it doesn't replace other patterns, it amplifies them. Apply this workflow to ANY pattern you choose (Regulation, Motivated Seller, Planning, etc.) to gain a 24-hour speed advantage over competition.

---

## 13. Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies ⭐ NEW

**Core Concept:** SearchLand refreshes data every 24 hours. Speed advantage = profit advantage.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)
- Time arbitrage = price arbitrage
```

### Pattern 13B: Fresh Planning Consent Alert
```
Strategy: Contact owner same day planning consent granted
Indicators:
- Planning status: Approved (filter)
- Decision date: Last 7 days (custom monitoring)
- Your action: Call owner immediately

Example Script:
"Congratulations on your consent. I have a buyer ready to move. 
Would £580k interest you?" (Owner unaware of £650k market value)

Profit: £70k in 48 hours (user example)

Strengths: Maximum information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires daily monitoring, fast response capability
Capital: Option agreement or cash purchase ready
```

### Pattern 13C: Lease Expiry Pre-Contact (90-Day Window)
```
Strategy: Contact owner 90 days before lease expiry (before void period)
Indicators:
- Lease end date: 60-120 days from today
- Use class: Commercial (E, B2, B8)
- Your offer: "Avoid void period, we have buyers ready"

Owner Psychology:
- 90 days out: Starting to worry about vacancy
- 30 days out: Panicking about lost income
- Post-expiry: Maximum pressure (carrying costs, no income)

Profit Source: Buy at "pre-panic" price, sell at market
```

### Pattern 13D: New Allocation Alert (Local Plan)
```
Strategy: Contact owner when site added to local plan allocations
Indicators:
- Housing allocation: Emerging (NEW)
- Applications in last 5 years: 0 (owner unaware)
- Your action: "Your site just got allocated—let's discuss before agent calls"

Example:
Day 1: SearchLand shows site added to emerging allocations
Day 1 (same day): You call owner offering £300k
Owner thinks: "My land was worth £150k yesterday, £300k is amazing!"
Reality: Market value post-allocation = £500k
Your profit: £200k by being first

Strengths: Massive information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires immediate action (speed critical)
```

### Pattern 13E: Fast Food Lease Expiry (High Visibility)
```
Strategy: Target high-footfall commercial with expiring leases
Indicators:
- Use class: E (restaurants/retail)
- Lease end date: Last 30 days (just expired)
- Footfall count: >2000/day (high value)
- Your action: Contact landlord (now in void period, cash flow pressure)

Why This Works:
- High footfall = high value but landlord may not realize
- Void period = immediate cash flow pressure
- Can offer "quick sale to avoid prolonged void"

Buyers: Fast food chains, convenience stores (high footfall valuable)
```

### Implementation Requirements

**System Setup:**
1. **Daily Automated Exports**
   - Export target filter results as CSV/JSON
   - Store with timestamp
   - Compare today vs yesterday (diff script)

2. **Alert Triggers**
   - New properties added: Email notification
   - Status changes: SMS + Email
   - Approaching thresholds (e.g., 90 days to lease expiry): Weekly digest

3. **Response Protocol**
   - Same-day contact for fresh consents
   - Script templates for different scenarios
   - Cash/option ready to move fast

**Tools Needed:**
- SearchLand API (or automated export)
- Diff comparison script (Python/Node)
- Email/SMS alerting system
- CRM for tracking contacts

### Capital Strategy

**Speed Capital:**
- Keep £50k-£200k liquid for immediate deployment
- Option agreements (£10k-£50k) for fast control
- Bridging finance arranged in advance (no delays)

**Profit Model:**
- Time arbitrage: Buy at "uninformed" price, sell at "informed" price
- Typical spread: 10-30% (£50k-£200k on £500k deal)
- Volume strategy: 10-20 deals/year = £500k-£2M profit

### Strengths
1. **Information asymmetry:** You know before owner/market
2. **No competition:** Pre-market, no agents, no bidders
3. **Premium pricing:** Buyers pay for exclusivity
4. **Scalable:** Automated monitoring, repeatable process
5. **High ROI:** Low capital, high profit margins

### Weaknesses
1. **Requires daily monitoring:** Labor-intensive or requires automation
2. **Speed critical:** Miss by 1 day = opportunity lost
3. **Competitive advantage erodes:** Once others adopt same strategy
4. **SearchLand dependency:** 24hr refresh only (not real-time)
5. **Execution risk:** Owner may not want to sell, buyer may back out

### Example Deal Flow

**Day 1 Morning:**
- SearchLand export shows planning consent granted yesterday
- Property: 4-unit scheme, Camden, owner-occupied

**Day 1 Afternoon:**
- Call owner: "Congratulations! I have a buyer at £580k, quick completion"
- Owner (unaware of £650k market value): "Yes, that sounds great!"

**Day 2:**
- Option agreement signed (£10k, 30-day exercise)
- Call buyer network: "Fresh consent, Camden, 4 units, £650k"
- Buyer: "Pre-vetted, no competition? Yes."

**Day 3-30:**
- Due diligence, legal, exercise option
- Completion: You buy £580k, sell £650k
- **Net profit: £60k** (after legals/costs)

**Annualized: 10 deals = £600k profit from speed arbitrage alone**

---

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### ❌ Over-Constraining
```
Problem: Combining too many restrictive filters
Example: Applications = 0 AND Price <£200k AND Derelict AND On-market AND PTAL 6a
Result: 0 results (filters compound restrictiveness)
Solution: Test incrementally, use separate filter groups for different approaches
```

### ❌ Geographic Mismatches
```
Problem: Using London-specific filters (PTAL) for UK-wide searches
Example: PTAL filter outside TfL area
Result: 0 results
Solution: Create separate approaches for London vs rest of UK
```

### ❌ Assuming Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem: Designing strategy around filters that don't exist
Example: "Planning Status: Expired" or "Price Reduced"
Result: Cannot implement strategy
Solution: Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md first
```

---

## 22. HMO Conversion Strategies ⭐ NEW (Stage 2 - Gemini + Grok)

**Added based on Stage 2 peer review - both Gemini and Grok independently suggested this pattern**

### Pattern 22A: University/Hospital Proximity HMO
```
Strategy: Target properties suitable for HMO conversion near education/healthcare demand
Source: Derived from regulation-driven patterns + market analysis
Proposed by: Gemini + Grok (Stage 2 consensus)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Existing Use Class: C3 (residential dwelling)
2. Title area (sqm): is greater than 100 AND less than 300
3. Distance to nearest university: less than 1000m
   OR Distance to nearest hospital: less than 1000m
4. Sales listing price: is less than £400,000
5. NOT: Article 4 direction HMO areas (manual check required)
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- Existing C3 residential (avoids commercial complications)
- Size: 100-300 sqm (adequate for 4-6 bedrooms)
- Proximity: <1km to university/hospital (tenant demand)
- Capital: <£400k (allows £50k-£100k conversion costs)
- Freehold: Easier to convert than leasehold

Strategic Rationale:
- Strong rental yields: 5-8% vs. 3-4% standard BTL
- Planning permission often not required (if <7 occupants, no Article 4)
- Professional tenant base (students/NHS staff)
- Lower voids due to institutional demand

Strengths:
- Higher yields than standard residential
- Established demand (universities/hospitals don't relocate)
- Can often convert without planning (check local policy)
- Exit strategy: Hold for yield OR sell to HMO operator

Weaknesses:
- Management intensive (multiple tenants, higher turnover)
- Licensing required in some areas (check LPA HMO licensing)
- Article 4 directions restrict conversions in some zones
- Fire safety/building regs more stringent

Capital requirement:
- Acquisition: £150k-£400k
- Conversion: £50k-£100k (bedrooms, ensuites, fire doors, certification)
- Licensing/legals: £5k-£15k
- Total: £205k-£515k

Planning Check:
- Confirm no Article 4 direction for HMOs in area
- Check if area is "cumulative impact zone" (HMO saturation)
- Verify local HMO licensing requirements
- <7 occupants usually permitted development (sui generis not required)

Exit Strategy:
1. Hold for rental income (5-8% yield)
2. Sell to HMO portfolio investor (premium vs. C3)
3. Convert back to C3 if market changes
```

### Pattern 22B: Transport Hub HMO
```
Strategy: HMO conversion targeting young professionals near transport
Source: User strategy (Stage 2 addition)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Existing Use Class: C3 (residential)
2. Title area (sqm): is greater than 120 AND less than 250
3. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 500m
4. PTAL: 4, 5, 6a, or 6b (London only - OR use train station proxy)
5. Sales listing price: is less than £500,000
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- C3 residential baseline
- 120-250 sqm (5-6 bedroom potential)
- <500m train station (commuter appeal)
- High PTAL or transport links
- Freehold preferred

Strategic Rationale:
- Young professional market (stable, higher income)
- Transport proximity = premium rents
- Lower management burden than student HMOs
- Strong capital appreciation in transport zones

Capital requirement:
- Acquisition: £250k-£500k
- Conversion: £60k-£120k
- Total: £310k-£620k
```

## 23. Unbroken Freehold Titles ⭐ NEW (Stage 2 - Gemini + Codex)

**Added based on Stage 2 peer review - both Gemini and Codex highlighted title assembly risk**

### Pattern 23A: Single-Title Large Parcels
```
Strategy: Target large development sites held as single freehold title (no assembly risk)
Source: SearchLand Preset #69 + reviewer insight
Proposed by: Gemini + Codex (Stage 2 consensus)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Freehold tenure: Yes
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 2 AND less than 20
3. Less than 10% area developed (development potential)
4. Ownership type: Private owner OR Company (single negotiation)
5. NOT: Multiple ownerships on site (manual title check)
6. NOT: Ransom strips (manual diligence)

Indicators:
- Freehold: Full control, no lease complications
- Single title: Ideally one title number (check Land Registry)
- Large parcel: 2-20 acres (meaningful development)
- Low development: <10% built (greenfield/brownfield opportunity)
- Single owner: One negotiation vs. multiple landowners

Strategic Rationale:
- **Assembly Risk Elimination:** No ransom strips, access disputes, or holdouts
- **Planning Simplification:** Single title = simpler red line boundary
- **Negotiation Efficiency:** One owner, one deal, one legal process
- **Exit Certainty:** Clean title = easier to sell to housebuilder

Strengths:
- No title assembly complexity (major risk reduction)
- Single negotiation (faster, lower legal costs)
- Planning applications simpler (no multi-owner complications)
- Housebuilders pay premium for clean title

Weaknesses:
- Single large parcels rarer than fragmented sites
- Owner knows site value (less negotiation leverage)
- Higher capital requirement (buying entire parcel)

Capital requirement:
- Varies by site: £500k-£10M+ (often institutional)
- Option agreements possible: £50k-£200k (secure site, lower upfront)
- Consider JV with housebuilder (reduces capital requirement)

Due Diligence Critical:
1. **Title check:** Verify single title number (Land Registry search)
2. **Access:** Confirm no ransom strips or third-party access requirements
3. **Easements:** Check for restrictive covenants or utility easements
4. **Boundaries:** Verify no boundary disputes with neighbors
5. **Planning history:** Check for previous applications/refusals

Strategy:
1. Filter for large freehold parcels
2. Verify single title via Land Registry
3. Check access (no ransom strips)
4. Assess planning potential
5. Negotiate direct OR secure option
6. Exit to housebuilder with planning or at land stage
```

### Pattern 23B: No Lease Complications
```
Strategy: Freehold sites avoiding leasehold complexities
Source: User strategy (Stage 2 addition)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Freehold tenure: Yes
2. NOT: Leasehold interests on site
3. NOT: Ground rent obligations
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5
5. Ownership type: Private owner (direct negotiation)

Indicators:
- Pure freehold (no leasehold layers)
- No ground rent complications
- No lease expiry issues
- Direct ownership path

Strategic Rationale:
- Leasehold can complicate planning/development
- Freeholder consent often required
- Ground rent obligations reduce value
- Simpler exit to developers

Strengths: Clean ownership, lower legal costs, easier financing
Weaknesses: May miss some opportunities (some leaseholds are viable)
Capital requirement: Varies by site size
```
