**Assessing environment constraints**
codex
Mixed-use 8-storey sites around 2M GDV need well-structured sourcing.

**Transit-Oriented Upzoning Plays**
- Target secondary stations on commuter rail lines slated for service upgrades; scrape municipal capital plans and select parcels currently zoned mid-density but in active rezoning studies permitting 8-storey mixed-use.
- Filter land assemblies of 2–4 adjoining lots with interim industrial/light commercial uses and low site coverage; prioritize sites with existing long-term leases that can bridge holding costs until approvals.
- Pre-negotiate conditional purchase options triggered on rezoning approval to cap land cost per buildable SF; model land residuals assuming upcoming density bonuses tied to affordable or mobility commitments.

**Adaptive-Reuse Air-Rights Strategy**
- Identify underbuilt civic/co-op properties with surplus structural capacity or adjacent parking decks; negotiate long-term ground leases plus air-rights transfers to achieve 7–8 storeys without new foundation costs.
- Commission structural/MEP due diligence upfront to confirm vertical expansion feasibility; integrate brownfield grants or heritage credits when reusing envelope to offset retrofit premiums.
- Structure phased construction so lower floors remain operational to preserve income; deploy prefabricated modular units for upper levels to minimize disruption and shorten schedule.

**Data-Driven Parcel Scoring & Off-Market Outreach**
- Build a GIS model combining by-right FAR, height overlays, assessed land values, and recent transaction comps; flag parcels where residual land value versus assessment shows >25% spread, signalling motivated owners.
- Overlay infrastructure constraints (storm/sewer capacity maps, planned district energy nodes) to avoid hidden servicing costs; score parcels for presence of existing utility easements simplifying tie-ins for mixed-use services.
- Run targeted outreach to property owners flagged by the model, offering seller financing arrangements with profit participation so owners stay invested; pair with expedited environmental screening to accelerate entitlement timeline.

Next steps: validate municipal rezoning timelines per short-listed nodes; engage structural engineer for adaptive opportunities; prototype the GIS scoring to start owner outreach.
