## Approach A: Fresh Consent Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 13A: Fresh planning consents (24h advantage)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£100k for option agreements on newly approved sites  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Planning applications in last 6 months: is greater than 0
2. Planning decision: is Approved
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.5
4. Building height (m): is less than 15 OR is greater than 25
5. Use class: contains E OR contains C3
6. Distance to train station (m): is less than 800
7. Flood zone: is not 3
8. Planning policy: contains Tall buildings OR contains Opportunity area
```

**Rationale:**
This leverages Pattern 13A for time arbitrage by targeting properties with recent approvals for 8-storey mixed-use developments, allowing quick capital deployment before market awareness. Based on precedent from approved applications in urban areas like Slough/Birmingham, where fresh consents signal immediate development potential without stalled processes.

**Strengths:**
- 24-hour advantage over competitors for option agreements
- Low capital entry via options (£10k-£50k each)
- Pre-approved planning reduces risk and timeline to 12-18 months
- High ROI potential from motivated sellers post-approval

**Limitations:**
- Narrow window before market adjusts prices
- Requires rapid due diligence on consent validity
- Competition from institutional buyers in urban areas
- Dependent on local authority processing speed

**Implementation Strategy:**
Monitor SearchLand daily for new approvals; contact agents immediately for options; structure deals with 6-12 month exclusivity; partner with developers for airspace additions to reach £2M profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option agreements: £50k
- Due diligence fees: £10k
- Legal structuring: £20k
- **Total:** £80k

## Approach B: Airspace Rights Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, £50k-£150k rights)  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£150k for airspace rights acquisition  
**Expected Results:** 15-35 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Building height (m): is greater than 10 AND less than 20
2. Roof type: is Flat
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
4. Use class: contains E OR contains Sui generis
5. Distance to train station (m): is less than 600
6. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 2
7. Flood zone: is not 3
8. Conservation area: is No
```

**Rationale:**
Exploits Pattern 6A for innovative arbitrage by purchasing airspace rights on existing buildings in tall building zones, enabling 8-storey additions without full site acquisition. Draws from precedents in Manchester/London where airspace developments achieved 10x ROI through joint ventures.

**Strengths:**
- Minimal disruption to existing operations
- Creative financing via rights sales (£50k-£150k per site)
- Faster planning approval for additions vs. new builds
- Arbitrage opportunity in undervalued urban rooftops

**Limitations:**
- Requires owner cooperation for rights
- Structural surveys add upfront costs
- Planning resistance in conservation-adjacent areas
- Market saturation in prime locations

**Implementation Strategy:**
Target flat-roof properties in PTAL 4+ areas; negotiate airspace leases with profit-sharing; bundle multiple rights for scale; exit via development partnerships aiming for £2M aggregate profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Airspace rights acquisition: £100k
- Structural surveys: £15k
- Legal fees: £25k
- **Total:** £140k

## Approach C: Stalled Planning Revival

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A: Stalled planning (expired but resubmittable)  
**Capital Required:** £30k-£70k for option agreements and planning consultants  
**Expected Results:** 25-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Planning applications in last 5 years: is greater than 0
2. Planning decision: is Refused OR is Withdrawn
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2.0
4. Building height (m): is less than 12
5. Use class: contains B1 OR contains A1
6. Distance to train station (m): is less than 750
7. Flood zone: is not 3
8. Planning policy: contains HDT OR contains Tall buildings
```

**Rationale:**
Applies Pattern 1A for timing advantage by reviving expired mixed-use applications, capitalizing on policy shifts favoring densification. Based on Birmingham precedents where stalled 8-storey proposals were resubmitted successfully, offering arbitrage through low-cost options.

**Strengths:**
- Low entry barriers with expired consents
- Speed to market by reusing prior applications
- Motivated sellers after planning failures
- Policy tailwinds for urban regeneration

**Limitations:**
- Risk of repeated refusals if issues unresolved
- Higher due diligence on refusal reasons
- Competition from developers with in-house planning teams
- Timeline extensions for resubmissions

**Implementation Strategy:**
Filter for recently expired applications; engage planning consultants for updates; secure options with clawback clauses; pursue joint ventures for funding to achieve £2M profit within 18-24 months.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option agreements: £40k
- Planning consultant fees: £20k
- Legal and surveys: £10k
- **Total:** £70k
