### Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Expired/Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreements £10k-£50k, planning promotion £20k-£50k, legal £10k-£30k)  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (narrow focus on Slough with specific planning history)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Last application submitted: is before 2020-01-01
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites in Slough and similar areas with stalled planning applications for tall mixed-use developments (8+ storeys), replicating the approved precedent. The Slough application involved demolition and 8-storey construction with retail and residential, so we focus on sites with old proposals for similar schemes that haven't progressed. Using Pattern 1A's "Old Planning + No Recent Activity" strategy, we identify motivated owners where planning work is done but stalled, allowing us to revive or amend applications for the target profit. Capital stays under £200k via option agreements, with expected GDV of £2M+ from completed schemes.

**Strengths:**
- Directly replicates successful Slough precedent (8-storey mixed-use)
- Planning derisked (existing proposals reduce approval time)
- Low capital entry via options (control sites without full purchase)
- High profit potential from stalled sites in growth areas

**Limitations:**
- Limited to areas with similar planning history (may miss new opportunities)
- Requires planning expertise to amend stalled applications
- Competition from other developers targeting same precedents
- Geographic focus on Slough may reduce result volume

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 5-15 sites with old mixed-use planning.
2. Research planning history via local authority portals to confirm stall reasons.
3. Secure option agreements (£10k-£50k) with owners, contingent on planning revival.
4. Engage planning consultants (£20k-£50k) to amend applications for 8-storey scheme.
5. Negotiate with local authorities for similar approvals as Slough precedent.
6. Exit via sale to housebuilder or development finance once planning granted.

### Approach B: Low-Capital Option-Driven Infill

**Strategic Pattern:** Low Capital Entry (Pattern 4B from FILTER_PATTERNS.md)  
**Capital Required:** £20k-£80k (option fees £5k-£20k, legals £5k-£15k, promotion £10k-£45k)  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (broader search for infill opportunities)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Latest sold date: No latest sold date
2. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
5. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
6. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
```

**Rationale:**
This non-precedent approach uses Pattern 4B's "Option Agreement Candidates" strategy, targeting inherited/legacy sites with no recent activity or sales, suitable for infill development. Unlike the Slough precedent, this focuses on unconstrained plots for smaller-scale residential intensification (4-6 units) to achieve £2M profit with minimal upfront capital. Sites are often undervalued due to passive ownership, allowing options to control multiple properties and promote planning for high-margin exits. Capital stays well under £200k, with volume strategy compensating for lower per-site profit.

**Strengths:**
- Completely different from precedent-based (no reliance on existing planning)
- Very low capital via options (access better sites without purchase)
- Volume approach (20-50 sites) increases hit rate for £2M target
- Targets motivated legacy owners unaware of development potential

**Limitations:**
- Requires strong negotiation skills for option agreements
- Planning risk higher (no precedent to follow)
- Lower profit per deal (compensated by volume)
- Dependent on owner willingness to agree to options

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for 20-50 legacy sites with no sales history and high unconstrained percentage.
2. Approach owners directly with option proposals (£5k-£20k deposits).
3. Conduct site assessments to confirm infill viability (4-6 units).
4. Promote planning applications for residential intensification.
5. Scale by securing options on multiple sites simultaneously.
6. Exit through bulk sales or individual completions once planning granted.

### Approach C: Regulation-Driven HMO Turnaround

**Strategic Pattern:** Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Pattern 8A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md)  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£180k (acquisition £50k-£120k, conversion £30k-£50k, legals £10k-£20k)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (focused on HMO compliance issues)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-01-01
3. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 1
5. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
6. NOT: Article 4 directions
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Rationale:**
This approach leverages Pattern 8A's "HMO Expired Licenses" strategy, targeting properties with expired HMO licenses that cannot legally operate, creating forced motivation for sale. Unlike the Slough precedent, this exploits regulatory deadlines for quick turnarounds via conversion or sale, achieving £2M profit through distressed pricing and redevelopment. Sites are often in transport-accessible areas suitable for residential intensification, with capital under £200k via direct purchases of motivated sellers. Combines with low EPC for double motivation (cannot rent without improvements).

**Strengths:**
- Strong regulatory motivation (expired licenses = illegal operation)
- Different from precedent (focuses on compliance issues, not planning history)
- Quick execution (motivated sellers, no long planning processes)
- Combines multiple signals (HMO expiry + low EPC) for higher conversion

**Limitations:**
- Limited to HMO properties (smaller pool than general searches)
- May require HMO expertise for compliance
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions limiting conversions
- Properties often need refurbishment (adds costs)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for 10-30 HMO sites with expired licenses and poor EPC.
2. Verify compliance status via local authority checks.
3. Purchase distressed properties at discounted prices (£50k-£120k).
4. Convert or refurbish for residential use (£30k-£50k).
5. Obtain new HMO licenses or change use to C3.
6. Sell completed properties for £2M+ total profit.
