**Approach A: Slough-Style Podium Towers**
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A – Height Intensification  
**Capital Required:** £150k control payment on <£1m town-centre site + £50k technical/pre-app fees = £200k  
**Expected Results:** 12-20 properties (dense urban titles with recent tall mixed-use proposals)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 22
3. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 6
4. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 0.8
6. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 30
7. Last application submitted: is between 01/01/2019 and 12/31/2023
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 700
9. Ownership type: is equal to Company
```

**Rationale:** Targets Slough-approved typology—compact podium plots with prior mixed-use tower attempts—so planning precedent is on-side and uplift to 8 storeys can justify £2m+ margin. Company-held land with recent tall proposals is often stalled after approval, making option deals feasible within £200k.

**Strengths:**  
- Direct precedent match to approved 8-storey mixed-use schemes  
- Transport-adjacent brownfield plots simplify viability evidence  

**Limitations:**  
- Reliance on prior applications excludes “clean” sites  
- Tall-building appetite varies by authority; manual policy check needed

**Implementation Strategy:** Export shortlisted titles, review decision notices for extant conditions, then secure control via option/subject-to planning agreements sized to £150k; allocate £50k to design tweaks and transport/planning consultants to refresh approvals and push GDV uplift >£2m.

**Approach B: Inactive High-Street Redevelopments**
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2C – Inactive Building + Transport Proximity  
**Capital Required:** £100k (20% exchange deposit on <£500k listing) + £60k planning/holding + £40k design/fees = £200k  
**Expected Results:** 18-35 properties (UK commuter high streets)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
2. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
3. Sales listing price: is less than £1,000,000
4. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b)
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
6. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 40
7. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
9. Ownership type: is equal to Company
```

**Rationale:** Focuses on derelict or vacant retail/resi blocks already on-market, so £200k covers deposit plus holding while redesigning into 6-20 apartments above refurbished retail. Tight commuter footprints yield 45-55% coverage of build costs vs. GDV, supporting £2m gross profit across 30-40 new units portfolio-wide.

**Strengths:**  
- Active sellers + evident vacancy increase negotiating leverage  
- Low entry capital because titles already marketed under £1m

**Limitations:**  
- Vendor expectations may still assume turn-key buyers  
- Need diligence on structural integrity of inactive fabric

**Implementation Strategy:** Pull daily refresh of results, triage by price/GDV ratio, then run rapid appraisal templates; submit conditional offers with 6-month completion, dedicating £60k to planning, surveys, and holding costs while standardizing upper-floor conversion layouts to hit the £2m aggregate profit goal.

**Approach C: Liquidation Mixed-Use Reboots**
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D – Liquidation/Administration Sales  
**Capital Required:** £120k (30% deposit on £400k forced sale) + £80k legal, planning refresh, and carrying costs = £200k  
**Expected Results:** 8-15 properties (distressed mid-rise sites)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, Administration
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
4. Developed area percentage: is greater than 25
5. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
6. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 10
7. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 60
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
```

**Rationale:** Liquidators must dispose of partially planned mixed-use blocks; buying sub-£500k assets with demonstrated multi-storey intent lets you stabilise capex schedule, then remarket or JV with housebuilders for 40+ units, pushing cumulative uplift past £2m once planning is reinstated.

**Strengths:**  
- Forced sellers shorten negotiation cycle, often below land value  
- Planning history plus mid-rise massing reduces design risk

**Limitations:**  
- Legal complexity (charges, receiver instructions) can delay completion  
- Need to revalidate planning conditions before build-out or resale

**Implementation Strategy:** Engage insolvency agents early, underwrite outstanding obligations, and ringfence £80k for legal clean-up and technical consultants; once planning is refreshed, package sites for forward funding or flip with improved documentation to lock in six-figure spreads per deal, compounding to the £2m profit goal.
