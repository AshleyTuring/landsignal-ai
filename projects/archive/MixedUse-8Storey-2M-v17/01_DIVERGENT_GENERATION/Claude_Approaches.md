## Approach A: Approved Precedent Site Matching

**Strategic Pattern:** Similar Planning Approvals (Precedent-Based)
**Capital Required:** £180,000 (Option + Planning Consultant)
**Expected Results:** 12-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: is one of E - Commercial, Business and Service, E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, other than hot food, E(b) - Sale of food and drink for consumption (mostly) on the premises
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
8. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
Targets underutilized commercial properties with site characteristics similar to the approved Slough 8-storey mixed-use development. Focuses on low-rise properties (<15m) on appropriate plots (0.2-2 acres) near transport infrastructure, where the Slough precedent can be directly referenced in planning applications. Inactive buildings suggest owners may be receptive to option agreements, allowing £180k to secure site control and fund planning work rather than outright purchase.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent reduces planning risk
- Site characteristics match approved development parameters
- Transport proximity supports density arguments
- Inactive status indicates potential for structured deals
- Capital focused on control and planning, not acquisition

**Limitations:**
- Requires manual verification of local planning policy alignment
- Precedent strength varies by local authority
- May need additional site-specific technical studies
- Owner willingness to enter option agreements uncertain

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter and identify 12-25 candidate sites
2. Desktop review of local authority policy on tall buildings and mixed-use
3. Approach owners with precedent-backed proposal for 18-24 month option
4. Secure option agreement (£60-80k fee)
5. Commission planning consultant to prepare application referencing Slough precedent (£80-100k)
6. Upon approval, sell to developer or exercise option and forward sell

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option fee: £80,000
- Planning consultant & technical reports: £90,000
- Legal fees: £10,000
- **Total:** £180,000

## Approach B: Long-Hold Corporate Assets

**Strategic Pattern:** Motivated Seller Identification (Corporate Legacy Holdings)
**Capital Required:** £150,000 (Deposit + Due Diligence)
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 3
4. Use class: is one of E(g)(iii) - Industrial Processes, B2 - General Industrial, B8 - Storage or Distribution
5. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
```

**Rationale:**
Identifies corporate-owned industrial/commercial sites held for 15+ years without development activity. These represent non-core assets that companies may not have actively monetized. Inactive buildings combined with long ownership suggest potential for off-market approaches where £150k provides a compelling deposit for conditional purchase or option agreement. Sites are sized and located for potential residential or mixed-use conversion.

**Strengths:**
- Targets unmotivated assets ripe for disposal
- Off-market approach reduces competition
- Corporate owners typically professional and capable of structured deals
- Long hold period may indicate inherited assets with flexible pricing
- Site characteristics support multiple end-use scenarios

**Limitations:**
- Requires research to identify decision-makers within companies
- Legacy sites may have contamination or title issues
- Planning for change of use requires thorough feasibility assessment
- Corporate approval processes can be slow

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify 15-30 corporate-owned long-hold properties
2. Research company status and identify property decision-makers
3. Approach with professional proposal emphasizing site unlocking
4. Structure conditional purchase with £150k deposit or option agreement
5. Conduct due diligence and planning feasibility during exclusivity
6. Either proceed to development with partners or assign opportunity to developer

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Deposit/option fee: £100,000
- Initial due diligence (surveys, contamination): £30,000
- Legal and advisory fees: £20,000
- **Total:** £150,000

## Approach C: Expired Planning Permission Recovery

**Strategic Pattern:** Stalled Planning Applications (Timing Arbitrage)
**Capital Required:** £120,000 (Control + Planning Refresh)
**Expected Results:** 8-15 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed" OR "residential" OR "dwellings"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 15
3. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0 AND less than 3
5. Use class: is one of E - Commercial, Business and Service, E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, other than hot food
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2.5
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200
```

**Rationale:**
Targets sites with lapsed or expired planning applications for residential or mixed-use development (15+ dwellings). Previous planning work demonstrates development intent and provides technical baseline. Applications pre-2022 that weren't pursued suggest stalled schemes due to market conditions, funding, or owner circumstances. £120k allows for site control and planning refresh using updated policy context and potentially the Slough precedent to strengthen applications.

**Strengths:**
- Prior planning work reduces risk and timeline
- Owner frustration with stalled projects increases deal motivation
- Technical studies often reusable, reducing costs
- Clear development intent already established
- Smaller capital requirement allows multiple shots

**Limitations:**
- Need to understand why original application stalled
- May require material redesign for current regulations
- Planning policy may have changed unfavorably
- Owner expectations may be anchored to previous valuations

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify 8-15 sites with lapsed planning applications
2. Review planning histories and understand refusal/withdrawal reasons
3. Assess viability of refreshing applications with current policy
4. Approach owners with proposal to revive scheme
5. Secure control via option or conditional purchase (£40-50k)
6. Refresh planning application with updated reports (£60-70k)
7. Upon approval, sell to developer or forward to delivery partner

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Site control fee (option/deposit): £50,000
- Planning refresh & updated reports: £60,000
- Legal and advisory: £10,000
- **Total:** £120,000
