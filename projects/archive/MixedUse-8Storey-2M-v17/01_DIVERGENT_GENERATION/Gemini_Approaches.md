## Approach A: Precedent-Driven Stalled Scheme

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A (Old Planning + No Recent Activity) combined with Pattern 4B (Option Agreement Candidates)
**Capital Required:** £25,000 - £75,000 (for Option & Legals)
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey" AND "residential" AND "retail"
2. Last application submitted: is before 2022-11-21
3. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
4. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
6. Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets the planning precedent provided. It searches for sites in Slough that have previously sought permission for a similar mixed-use, multi-storey development but have not seen recent activity. This suggests the project has stalled. According to `FILTER_PATTERNS.md` (Pattern 1A), these owners may be frustrated and open to a deal. By targeting off-market sites (`Sales listing currently on the market: No`), the strategy is optimized for securing an option agreement, which aligns with the low capital outlay as described in Pattern 4B. The filter for `Max number of dwellings applied for` ensures the scale of the previous attempt is significant enough to support the target profit.

**Strengths:**
- Directly leverages the approved precedent in the same local authority (Slough), strengthening the planning argument.
- Planning and design work has already been done, reducing initial pre-development costs.
- Targets potentially motivated sellers who have failed to execute their plans.
- Low capital entry via an option agreement preserves the £200k budget.
- Highly targeted search, leading to a manageable number of high-potential leads.

**Limitations:**
- The reasons for the original project stalling may be significant (e.g., site contamination, access issues, economic non-viability).
- The owner may have already sold or may not be motivated to deal.
- The search is geographically constrained to Slough, limiting the number of potential results.
- Requires strong negotiation skills to secure a favorable option agreement.
- The planning policies may have changed since the last application was submitted.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Execute the search in SearchLand to identify 10-30 target properties.
2.  For each property, conduct desktop due diligence to understand the site context and review the previous planning application in detail on the council's portal.
3.  Identify the legal owner through Land Registry and make a direct approach.
4.  Propose an option agreement with a 12-24 month term, offering a non-refundable option fee.
5.  Once the option is secured, refine the existing plans, address any previous reasons for failure, and submit a new planning application.
6.  Upon receiving planning consent, either exercise the option and develop the project, or sell the site with planning permission to a larger developer for a profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee: £20,000 - £60,000
- Legal Fees (for option agreement): £5,000 - £15,000
- **Total:** £25,000 - £75,000

## Approach B: Distressed Asset Acquisition

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)
**Capital Required:** £150,000 - £200,000
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.5
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
6. Sales listing price: is less than 200000
7. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:**
This approach focuses on a powerful motivation signal rather than a planning precedent. As highlighted in `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`, companies in liquidation are under a legal obligation to sell assets, often quickly and at a discount. This creates a strong negotiating position for a cash-ready buyer. The strategy targets sites of a suitable size (0.2-2.5 acres) for a significant development, located near transport links to support higher density and value. By filtering for on-market listings under £200,000, it directly addresses the capital constraint. The profit would come from acquiring the site at a below-market rate and then pursuing a high-density development, similar in scale to the 8-storey precedent.

**Strengths:**
- Targets sellers with maximum motivation (forced sale).
- High potential for acquiring land at a significant discount to market value.
- The £200k capital can be used for direct acquisition, providing full control.
- Clear decision-maker (the liquidator) who is motivated by speed and certainty.
- Not geographically constrained, increasing the potential pool of opportunities across the UK.

**Limitations:**
- The pool of properties in liquidation at any given time is small and competitive.
- Assets may have significant underlying problems (legal disputes, contamination, poor condition) that led to the company's failure.
- Liquidators, while motivated, are also obligated to achieve a reasonable price, which may still be contested.
- Requires the ability to transact very quickly, often with cash.
- The low price point (£200k) for a developable site of this size is ambitious, even in a distressed sale.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the search and set up alerts for new properties matching the criteria, as speed is critical.
2.  Immediately engage the selling agent or liquidator upon identifying a target property.
3.  Conduct rapid due diligence, focusing on any potential liabilities or "hair" on the deal.
4.  Submit a clean, unconditional cash offer to maximize appeal to the liquidator.
5.  Once acquired, assess the site's potential and develop a planning strategy for a high-density, mixed-use scheme to generate the target profit.
6.  Either develop the site or obtain planning permission and sell the de-risked project to a larger developer.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition Cost: £150,000 - £190,000
- Legal & Due Diligence Fees: £5,000 - £10,000
- **Total:** £155,000 - £200,000

## Approach C: Airspace Development on Under-Utilised Commercial Blocks

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Flat Roof + Height Headroom) combined with Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + High Accessibility)
**Capital Required:** £50,000 - £150,000 (for Airspace Rights & Fees)
**Expected Results:** 20-75 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service"
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 2
6. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
7. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy seeks to create value by identifying under-developed assets in high-value locations. It targets low-rise (under 15m, ~4 storeys) commercial buildings with flat roofs, situated close to train stations where planning policy is more likely to support height and intensification. This aligns with `FILTER_PATTERNS.md` Patterns 3A and 6A. By targeting freehold properties with few or no leases and that are not on the market, the approach is designed to directly engage the owner to purchase the "airspace" rights to build additional storeys. This is a low-capital entry method, as the £200k budget is used to secure the development rights rather than purchasing the entire building and land. The 8-storey goal is achieved by adding 4-5 new floors on top of the existing structure.

**Strengths:**
- Highly capital-efficient, using the budget to secure rights, not the entire asset.
- Leverages existing structures and utilities, reducing ground-up development costs.
- Targets locations with strong transport links, which inherently supports higher property values and density.
- Creates "new" land in dense urban areas where vacant plots are scarce.
- Off-market approach reduces competition.

**Limitations:**
- Requires a structural survey to confirm the existing building can support additional floors, which can be costly and uncertain.
- Negotiating with freeholders can be complex and they may have high price expectations for their airspace.
- Rights of light issues with neighbouring properties can be a significant obstacle.
- Gaining vacant possession of the roof (e.g., removing existing telecom equipment) can be difficult.
- Construction logistics for building on top of an existing, possibly occupied, building are complex.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Execute the search to identify a list of potential buildings.
2.  Research the ownership of the top 20-30 candidates and formulate an outreach plan.
3.  Approach the freeholder with a proposal to purchase the airspace rights, subject to a structural survey and planning permission.
4.  Negotiate and secure an option to purchase the airspace for a fixed price.
5.  Engage architects and structural engineers to confirm feasibility and design a scheme for additional residential floors.
6.  Submit a planning application for the vertical extension.
7.  Once planning is granted, exercise the option, and either build out the scheme or sell the "shovel-ready" project.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee for Airspace Rights: £40,000 - £120,000
- Professional Fees (Structural Engineer, Architect, Planning Consultant): £15,000 - £30,000
- **Total:** £55,000 - £150,000
