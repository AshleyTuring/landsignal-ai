### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

After reviewing the disagreement analysis and the provided reference materials, I have reconsidered my original positions.

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
*   None. The disagreement analysis has reinforced the factual accuracy of my original assessments regarding filter syntax, planning law interpretation, and business case viability. The points of contention arose from either an incorrect legal interpretation by another model or an over-cautious stance where a definitive one was warranted.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
*   **Grok - Approach C: Permitted Development Mixed-Use Conversion:** Still **INVALID**.
    *   **Reasoning:** My original position that this strategy is based on a fundamental misinterpretation of planning law stands. The counter-argument—that the existence of a `Percentage profit (Class MA only)` filter validates the strategy—is incorrect. This filter's presence confirms Class MA is a concept within the SearchLand tool, but it does not legitimize its application for an 8-storey new-build. UK planning law's Class MA Part 20 permits upward extensions, typically limited to **two storeys** on specific building types, not the large-scale airspace development required for an "8-storey equivalent." The business case is therefore built on a legally non-viable foundation.

*   **Grok - Approach B: Derelict Urban Turnaround:** Still **INVALID**.
    *   **Reasoning:** The disagreement analysis confirms a unanimous consensus on this point. A construction budget of £30k-£50k for an 8-storey mixed-use building is unrealistic by several orders of magnitude, making the business case fatally flawed. My initial assessment was correct.

*   **All approaches with identified syntax errors (Codex A, B, C; Gemini A, B; Grok B, C):** The original **CONDITIONAL** or **INVALID** statuses are maintained.
    *   **Reasoning:** My definitive stance on correct filter syntax was accurate. The analysis shows a 3-to-1 consensus on the following, confirming my original critiques:
        *   **Price Format:** Price filters require bare integers (e.g., `2000000`), not formatted strings with currency symbols (`£2,000,000`).
        *   **Date Format:** Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
        *   **Exclusion Syntax:** Negative constraints (e.g., `NOT: Green Belt`) are invalid. The correct method is using zero-value filters like `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0`.
        *   **Filter Taxonomy (Gemini A):** My assessment that `Use class` and `Property classification` are separate filters and their values cannot be mixed was unanimously confirmed as correct.

**Clarifications:**
*   **Filter Existence vs. Strategic Viability:** A critical point of misunderstanding in the analysis of Grok - Approach C is the distinction between a filter's existence and its correct strategic application. The presence of a `Class MA` filter in SearchLand does not endorse any and all strategies that invoke its name. The tool provides the mechanism, but the user must apply it within the strict confines of planning law. My critique correctly identified that the proposed strategy was far outside those legal bounds.
*   **Consensus vs. Disagreement:** Several issues flagged as "disagreements" were actually points of broad consensus where my initial assessment was validated by the majority of models. My positions on price formatting, filter mixing, and the non-viability of Grok B's business case were not minority opinions but were, in fact, the correct, evidence-based conclusions.
