# Technical & Business Case Iteration Task

## Context
You previously reviewed approaches and identified technical and business case issues. Other LLMs disagreed with some of your assessments.

## Your Task
**Reconsider your positions** based on the disagreement analysis below. You may:
1. **Maintain your position** (with additional evidence)
2. **Change your position** (if you were mistaken)
3. **Clarify your position** (if misunderstood)

## What to Focus On
- Factual correctness (filter existence, units, syntax)
- Business case viability (capital, ROI, implementation feasibility)
- Evidence-based reasoning (cite sources)
- Technical and financial precision (not strategic preference)

## Output Format
### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Approach [X]: Was [STATUS], now [STATUS] because [evidence]

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Approach [Y]: Still [STATUS] because [evidence]

**Clarifications:**
- [Any misunderstandings to clear up]


## DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS

# DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS REPORT

After analyzing all four critique files for technical and business case disagreements, I have identified the following:

---

## DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

---

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** Business Case - Construction Capital Feasibility  
**Approaches:** Grok - Approach B: Derelict Urban Turnaround  
**Positions:**
- **Claude:** Initially marked VALID, then changed to INVALID after further review. "£10M gap cannot be rationalized as 'execution risk'. Approach explicitly describes construction, not planning-only." States the £100k-£150k budget with £30-50k for construction cannot fund an 8-storey build requiring £10M-£15M.
- **Codex:** INVALID. "Construction budget/ROI math is fundamentally wrong—£30k-£50k for 'initial construction' cannot produce or even meaningfully start an 8-storey mixed-use building... orders of magnitude below real-world costs."
- **Gemini:** INVALID. "The proposed capital plan (£100k-£150k total) allocates only £30k-£50k for 'initial construction' to deliver an 8-storey mixed-use building. This budget is unrealistic by orders of magnitude."
- **Grok:** INVALID. "Business case invalid due to unrealistic construction capital (iterations confirm £100k-£150k insufficient for 8-storey build)."

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** NO  
**Note:** This is unanimous agreement that the approach is INVALID, not a disagreement. All LLMs concur the business case fails.

---

### Disagreement #2
**Type:** Planning Law Interpretation / Business Case Validity  
**Approaches:** Grok - Approach C: Permitted Development Mixed-Use Conversion  
**Positions:**
- **Claude:** CONDITIONAL (not INVALID). "Gemini wrong: Class MA Part 20 IS for airspace development. SearchLand has 'Percentage profit (Class MA only)' filter - validates strategy. BUT unit error (sqft vs acres) is CRITICAL."
- **Codex:** INVALID. "Business logic assumes Class MA can add airspace floors, but the prior-approval route only converts existing E-class floor area; new storeys would still need full planning and far more than the £120k-£180k budget."
- **Gemini:** INVALID. "The strategy to use Class MA PDR to create an '8-storey equivalent' is incorrect. Class MA allows for change of use and, under Part 20, upward extensions of typically only two storeys. It cannot be used for large-scale airspace development to achieve an 8-storey height."
- **Grok:** CONDITIONAL. Business case marked "auto-valid as precedent-based." Technical issues noted but no planning law validity challenge.

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES  
**Nature of Disagreement:** Claude asserts Class MA Part 20 DOES support airspace development (citing SearchLand's Class MA filter as evidence), while Codex and Gemini assert it only allows change of use + limited upward extension (typically 2 storeys), not large-scale 8-storey development. This is a factual dispute about what Class MA permits under UK planning law.

---

### Disagreement #3
**Type:** Filter Syntax - Price Format  
**Approaches:** Multiple (Codex A, Codex B, Codex C, Grok B, Grok C)  
**Positions:**
- **Claude:** "⚠️ Currency/Date Formats: Acknowledging Uncertainty. Cannot definitively confirm without testing. Codex likely correct on bare integers for prices. Marking affected approaches CONDITIONAL pending Phase 1 testing."
- **Codex:** Definitive. "Filter 10 keeps the `£2,000,000` price format with currency symbol/comma; the documented working syntax uses bare integers (LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:801-806)." Applied consistently to all approaches.
- **Gemini:** Definitive. "Price filters require bare integers without currency symbols or commas." Applied consistently to all approaches.
- **Grok:** Definitive but cautious. "Sales listing price: is less than £2,000,000 (may require bare integer 2000000)." Uses "may require" language but treats as needing correction.

**Impact:** Minor (affects executability but easily fixable)  
**Requires iteration:** NO  
**Nature of Disagreement:** Claude acknowledges uncertainty and cannot definitively confirm syntax requirements, while other three LLMs assert with confidence that bare integers are required. This is a technical documentation interpretation disagreement, but all agree it needs testing/fixing before execution.

---

### Disagreement #4
**Type:** Filter Existence - Property Classification vs Use Class  
**Approaches:** Gemini - Approach A: Urban Intensification  
**Positions:**
- **Claude:** CONDITIONAL. "Filter 4: ❌ MIXING TWO SEPARATE FILTERS. 'Car park'/'Unused land' are Property Classification, NOT Use Class. Evidence: SearchLand lists these as distinct filters. Fix: Split into two filters."
- **Codex:** CONDITIONAL. "Filter 4 mixes valid strings with an invalid `Car park` value—SearchLand expects the full dropdown text such as `Car/coach/commercial vehicle/taxi parking`, `Public car parking`, or `Car park space`."
- **Gemini:** CONDITIONAL. "Filter 4... incorrectly combines a `Use class` value with `Property classification` values ('Car park', 'Unused land'). These are separate filters in SearchLand."
- **Grok:** CONDITIONAL. "Use class: is one of 'E - Commercial, Business and Service', 'Car park', 'Car/coach/commercial vehicle/taxi parking', 'Unused land' (mixes Use class and Property classification; separate)."

**Impact:** Minor (all agree it's wrong and needs fixing)  
**Requires iteration:** NO  
**Nature of Disagreement:** Not a true disagreement—all four agree the filter mixing is invalid. The subtle difference is Codex suggests the values might work if using full dropdown text, while others say they must be separated into two distinct filters. This is a minor implementation detail disagreement.

---

## SUMMARY

**True Disagreements Requiring Resolution: 2**

1. **Critical**: Grok C planning law validity (Class MA scope for airspace development)
2. **Minor**: Price format syntax certainty level (though all agree testing needed)

**Unanimous Agreements (Not Disagreements):**
- Grok B construction capital is invalid
- Constraint exclusion syntax ("does not contain", "NOT:") is invalid across all approaches
- Date format must be ISO YYYY-MM-DD
- Filter taxonomy mixing (Gemini A) is invalid

**Strategic Differences (Correctly Excluded):**
- Priority rankings vary but no LLM disputes another's ranking
- Testing sequence preferences differ (philosophical, not technical)
- Capital range interpretations vary within acceptable bounds

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**Requires Iteration:** YES, for Grok - Approach C only

**Specific Question for Resolution:**
Does Class MA Permitted Development Right under Part 20 support the creation of 8-storey equivalent airspace development as claimed by Claude, or is it limited to change of use + 2-storey upward extensions as claimed by Codex and Gemini?

**Evidence to Gather:**
1. Official UK Planning Portal guidance on Class MA Part 20 scope
2. SearchLand's "Percentage profit (Class MA only)" filter documentation
3. Case law or precedent examples of Class MA applications for multi-storey airspace

**All Other Approaches:** Can proceed to syntax correction and testing. No blocking disagreements on business case validity or filter existence for the remaining 9 approaches.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

---

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

## **VALIDATION SUMMARY**

✅ **VALID: 2 approaches (20%)**
⚠️ **CONDITIONAL: 7 approaches (70%)**  
❌ **INVALID: 1 approach (10%)**

---

## **CLAUDE APPROACHES**

### **Claude A: Precedent-Matched Stalled Planning - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Filter 8:** `Planning constraints: does not contain Green Belt land` ❌
  - **Problem:** "does not contain" is NOT valid syntax
  - **Fix:** `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0`
  - **Evidence:** SearchLand uses percentage-based exclusion filters

**Capital:** £190k-£255k (lower bound £190k achievable within budget)

**Assessment:** Strong precedent strategy, one syntax fix required.

---

### **Claude B: Airspace Rights - ✅ VALID**

**Technical:** All filters exist, correct syntax, proper units  
**Capital:** £88k-£170k (best capital efficiency)  
**ROI:** £1.37M-£2.42M (meets target)  
**Strategy:** Proven airspace development model

**Assessment:** No issues - executable as written.

---

### **Claude C: Liquidation Distressed Assets - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Filter 10:** `Planning constraints: does not contain Flood Zone 3` ❌
  - **Fix:** `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0`

**Capital:** £180k-£357k (lower bound achievable)  
**Strategy:** Excellent motivation signal (liquidation = forced sale per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md)

**Assessment:** One syntax fix, strong approach otherwise.

---

## **CODEX APPROACHES**

### **Codex A: Crossrail Mixed-Use - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 9:** `Sales listing price: is less than £2,000,000` ⚠️
   - **Problem:** Currency symbols/commas likely invalid
   - **Fix:** `Sales listing price: is less than 2000000`
   - **Evidence:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE strictness on dates suggests numeric strictness

2. **Filter 8:** Same constraint exclusion error as Claude A

**Assessment:** Two syntax fixes needed, strong transport-led strategy.

---

### **Codex B: High Street Podium - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 10:** `Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2016` ❌
   - **Problem:** DD/MM/YYYY format INVALID
   - **Fix:** `Latest sold date: is before 2016-01-01` (ISO format)
   - **Evidence:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE explicitly requires YYYY-MM-DD

2. **Filter 9:** Same price format issue (currency symbols)

3. **Filter 2:** `Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b)` ⚠️
   - **Minor:** Abbreviations may not work, full text safer
   - **Impact:** Low (UK statutory abbreviations likely accepted)

**Assessment:** Multiple syntax errors, all fixable.

---

### **Codex C: Stalled Resubmissions - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 2:** `Last application submitted: is before 01/01/2023` ❌ (date format)
2. **Filter 9:** `Last updated by Land Registry date: is before 01/01/2024` ❌ (date format)
3. **Filter 10:** Constraint exclusion syntax error
4. **Filter 5:** `Ownership type: is Company` (should be quoted)

**Assessment:** Four syntax errors, strategy sound.

---

## **GEMINI APPROACHES**

### **Gemini A: Urban Intensification - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 4:** ❌ **MIXING TWO SEPARATE FILTERS**
   ```
   Use class: is one of "E - Commercial...", "Car park", "Unused land"
   ```
   - **Problem:** "Car park"/"Unused land" are **Property Classification**, NOT Use Class
   - **Evidence:** SearchLand lists these as distinct filters
   - **Fix:** Split into two filters:
     - `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service"`
     - `Property classification: is one of "Car park", "Unused land"`

2. **Filter 8:** `NOT: Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings` ❌
   - **Problem:** "NOT:" operator doesn't exist
   - **Fix:** Use percentage filters for each constraint

**Assessment:** Subtle but critical taxonomy error requires restructure.

---

### **Gemini B: Distressed Asset Acquisition - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Filter 6:** `NOT: Green Belt land` ❌
  - **Fix:** `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0`

**Strategy:** ⭐ EXCELLENT - "Company status: Liquidation" is VERY STRONG motivation signal (documented in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md)

**Assessment:** One syntax fix, otherwise excellent approach.

---

## **GROK APPROACHES**

### **Grok A: Slough-Style Mixed-Use - ✅ VALID**

**Technical:** All filters correct, proper date format (ISO), correct constraint syntax  
**Capital:** £150k-£200k (within budget)  
**Strategy:** Direct precedent replication, strong filter logic

**Assessment:** No issues - executable as written.

---

### **Grok B: Derelict Urban Turnaround - ❌ INVALID**

**CRITICAL BUSINESS CASE FAILURE:**

**The Math:**
- **Stated budget:** £100k-£150k
- **Stated strategy:** "Demolish and rebuild 8-storey mixed-use"
- **Actual 8-storey construction cost:** £10M-£15M
  - Industry standard: £2,000-£3,000/sqm
  - 8 storeys × 500 sqm/floor = 4,000 sqm
  - 4,000 sqm × £2,500/sqm = **£10,000,000**

**Gap: £9.85M-£14.85M UNFUNDED**

**Stated vs Reality:**
```
Stated:        Reality Needed:
£30-50k        £10-15M construction ❌
```

**Evidence:**
- Codex: "orders of magnitude too low"
- Gemini: "completely unrealistic... cost would be in the millions"
- My initial review: Missed this critical flaw

**Technical Issues:**
- Filter 2: Price currency format error

**Assessment:** Fundamental business case failure - cannot be executed as described. Requires full rewrite (either planning-stage exit strategy OR downscale to 2-3 storeys).

---

### **Grok C: PDR Mixed-Use Conversion - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 2:** `Title area (sqft): is greater than 100 AND less than 8000` ❌
   - **Problem:** "Title area (sqft)" DOES NOT EXIST
   - **Evidence:** SearchLand only has "Title area (acres)"
   - **Fix:** Convert units: `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25`
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - filter will fail completely

2. **Missing filter:** Needs `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes`
   - **Evidence:** Price filters require market status pairing

3. **Filter 8:** Price currency format issue

**Class MA Validity:**
- **Gemini claims:** "Class MA not for 8-storey development"
- **Counter-evidence:** Class MA Part 20 (2021) DOES support upward extension (+2 storeys)
- **My assessment:** Gemini wrong on planning law, BUT 8-storey target unrealistic (Part 20 limited to +2 storeys = 6 total max)

**Assessment:** Critical unit error + missing filter + scope needs clarification.

## **ITERATION POSITION CHANGES**

### **Where I'm Changing Position:**

**Grok B: Was VALID → Now INVALID**
- ✅ Codex and Gemini correct - I missed construction cost failure
- £10M gap cannot be rationalized as "execution risk"
- Approach explicitly describes construction, not planning-only

**Currency/Date Formats: Acknowledging Uncertainty**
- Cannot definitively confirm without testing
- Codex likely correct on bare integers for prices
- Marking affected approaches CONDITIONAL pending Phase 1 testing

### **Where I'm Maintaining Position:**

**Grok C Class MA: Still CONDITIONAL (not INVALID)**
- Gemini wrong: Class MA Part 20 IS for airspace development
- SearchLand has "Percentage profit (Class MA only)" filter - validates strategy
- BUT unit error (sqft vs acres) is CRITICAL
- Maintained: CONDITIONAL due to unit error + scope clarification

**Gemini A Property Classification: Still CONDITIONAL**
- SearchLand lists Use Class and Property Classification as SEPARATE filters
- "Car park" is NOT a Use Class
- Filter mixing will cause rejection
- Maintained: CONDITIONAL (must split)

**Constraint Exclusion: Still requires fixes**
- NO "NOT:" operator in SearchLand
- NO "does not contain" for constraints
- Must use percentage-based filters
- Maintained: CRITICAL errors

## **PRIORITY TESTING ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Syntax Verification (Run First)**
1. **Price format:** `£2,000,000` vs `2000000` (affects 5 approaches)
2. **Date format:** `01/01/2016` vs `2016-01-01` (documented, affects 2)
3. **Use class abbreviations:** `E` vs full text (low priority, affects 1)

### **Phase 2: Approach Testing (After Fixes)**

**Tier 1: Test First ⭐**
1. Claude B (Airspace Rights) - VALID, cleanest
2. Grok A (Slough-Style) - VALID, strong precedent
3. Gemini B (Liquidation) - 1 easy fix, excellent motivation

**Tier 2: Strong Approaches**
4. Claude C (Liquidation)
5. Claude A (Precedent-Matched)
6. Codex A (Crossrail)

**Tier 3: More Work Needed**
7. Gemini A (Urban Intensification)
8. Codex B (High Street Podium)
9. Codex C (Stalled Resubmissions)
10. Grok C (PDR Conversion)

**Tier 4: Requires Rewrite**
11. Grok B (Derelict Turnaround) - INVALID

## **STRATEGIC DIVERSITY ✅**

Despite technical issues, strategic coverage is EXCELLENT:

- ✅ **Precedent-based:** Claude A, Codex A, Grok A
- ✅ **Capital-efficient:** Claude B (airspace), Gemini A (option), Grok C (PDR)
- ✅ **Motivation-driven:** Claude C & Gemini B (liquidation)
- ✅ **Regulation-driven:** Gemini B, Grok C (PDR)
- ✅ **Time arbitrage:** Codex C (stalled resubmissions)
- ✅ **Niche:** Codex B (podium intensification)

## **KEY FINDINGS**

### **Most Common Errors:**
1. Constraint exclusion syntax (NOT:, "does not contain") - 6 approaches
2. Price currency formatting - 5 approaches
3. Date formatting - 2 approaches
4. Filter taxonomy mixing - 1 approach

### **Strongest Approaches (Post-Fix):**
1. **Claude B** - Capital efficient (£88k), valid filters
2. **Grok A** - Direct precedent, valid filters
3. **Gemini B** - Liquidation signal, 1 easy fix
4. **Claude C** - High profit (£2.87M), 1 easy fix

### **Success Rate:**
- **70-80% will be VALID after fixes** (7-8 of 10 approaches)
- All meet £2M profit target (except Grok B)
- Capital range £88k-£200k achieved
- Strategic diversity maintained

**VALIDATION COMPLETE**  
**Overall Assessment:** Strong strategic foundation, mostly fixable technical issues  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH (post-fixes)  
**Next Step:** Phase 1 Syntax Testing → Apply Fixes → Phase 2 Parallel Testing
