# Disagreement Detection Task

Analyze the 4 critique files and identify TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS CASE DISAGREEMENTS.

## What Counts as Disagreement
- LLM A says filter exists, LLM B says it doesn't (factual dispute)
- LLM A says "acres", LLM B says "sqft" for same filter (unit dispute)
- LLM A says VALID syntax, LLM B says INVALID syntax (technical dispute)
- LLM A says £n is sufficient, LLM B says it's not (capital feasibility dispute)
- LLM A says ROI achievable, LLM B says unrealistic (business case dispute)
- LLM A says deal structure works, LLM B says legally/financially flawed (implementation dispute)

## What Does NOT Count
- Priority rankings (A ranks #1, B ranks #3 - both valid)
- Strategic preferences (speed vs certainty - philosophical)
- Implementation styles (different but both correct)

## Special Note on Precedent-Based Approaches
For approaches replicating user-provided planning applications:
- Business case is AUTO-VALID (user requested it)
- Focus validation on: Do filters actually replicate the precedent correctly?
- Multiple valid filter implementations are expected and acceptable

## Output Format
If disagreements exist:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** [Filter existence | Units | Syntax | Capital feasibility | ROI | Deal structure]
**Approaches:** [Which approaches affected]
**Positions:**
- LLM A: [Position]
- LLM B: [Position]
- LLM C: [Position]
- LLM D: [Position]

**Impact:** [Critical | Minor]
**Requires iteration:** [YES | NO]

---

If no disagreements:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: NO

All LLMs agree on technical and business case facts. Strategic differences are preserved.


## CRITIQUES TO ANALYZE

### Claude_Critique

I'll provide the comprehensive validation directly:

# COMPREHENSIVE VALIDATION REPORT
## Technical & Business Case Review of All Approaches

---

## **VALIDATION SUMMARY**

✅ **VALID: 2 approaches (20%)**
⚠️ **CONDITIONAL: 7 approaches (70%)**  
❌ **INVALID: 1 approach (10%)**

---

## **CLAUDE APPROACHES**

### **Claude A: Precedent-Matched Stalled Planning - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Filter 8:** `Planning constraints: does not contain Green Belt land` ❌
  - **Problem:** "does not contain" is NOT valid syntax
  - **Fix:** `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0`
  - **Evidence:** SearchLand uses percentage-based exclusion filters

**Capital:** £190k-£255k (lower bound £190k achievable within budget)

**Assessment:** Strong precedent strategy, one syntax fix required.

---

### **Claude B: Airspace Rights - ✅ VALID**

**Technical:** All filters exist, correct syntax, proper units  
**Capital:** £88k-£170k (best capital efficiency)  
**ROI:** £1.37M-£2.42M (meets target)  
**Strategy:** Proven airspace development model

**Assessment:** No issues - executable as written.

---

### **Claude C: Liquidation Distressed Assets - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Filter 10:** `Planning constraints: does not contain Flood Zone 3` ❌
  - **Fix:** `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0`

**Capital:** £180k-£357k (lower bound achievable)  
**Strategy:** Excellent motivation signal (liquidation = forced sale per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md)

**Assessment:** One syntax fix, strong approach otherwise.

---

## **CODEX APPROACHES**

### **Codex A: Crossrail Mixed-Use - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 9:** `Sales listing price: is less than £2,000,000` ⚠️
   - **Problem:** Currency symbols/commas likely invalid
   - **Fix:** `Sales listing price: is less than 2000000`
   - **Evidence:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE strictness on dates suggests numeric strictness

2. **Filter 8:** Same constraint exclusion error as Claude A

**Assessment:** Two syntax fixes needed, strong transport-led strategy.

---

### **Codex B: High Street Podium - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 10:** `Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2016` ❌
   - **Problem:** DD/MM/YYYY format INVALID
   - **Fix:** `Latest sold date: is before 2016-01-01` (ISO format)
   - **Evidence:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE explicitly requires YYYY-MM-DD

2. **Filter 9:** Same price format issue (currency symbols)

3. **Filter 2:** `Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b)` ⚠️
   - **Minor:** Abbreviations may not work, full text safer
   - **Impact:** Low (UK statutory abbreviations likely accepted)

**Assessment:** Multiple syntax errors, all fixable.

---

### **Codex C: Stalled Resubmissions - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 2:** `Last application submitted: is before 01/01/2023` ❌ (date format)
2. **Filter 9:** `Last updated by Land Registry date: is before 01/01/2024` ❌ (date format)
3. **Filter 10:** Constraint exclusion syntax error
4. **Filter 5:** `Ownership type: is Company` (should be quoted)

**Assessment:** Four syntax errors, strategy sound.

---

## **GEMINI APPROACHES**

### **Gemini A: Urban Intensification - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 4:** ❌ **MIXING TWO SEPARATE FILTERS**
   ```
   Use class: is one of "E - Commercial...", "Car park", "Unused land"
   ```
   - **Problem:** "Car park"/"Unused land" are **Property Classification**, NOT Use Class
   - **Evidence:** SearchLand lists these as distinct filters
   - **Fix:** Split into two filters:
     - `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service"`
     - `Property classification: is one of "Car park", "Unused land"`

2. **Filter 8:** `NOT: Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings` ❌
   - **Problem:** "NOT:" operator doesn't exist
   - **Fix:** Use percentage filters for each constraint

**Assessment:** Subtle but critical taxonomy error requires restructure.

---

### **Gemini B: Distressed Asset Acquisition - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issue:**
- **Filter 6:** `NOT: Green Belt land` ❌
  - **Fix:** `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0`

**Strategy:** ⭐ EXCELLENT - "Company status: Liquidation" is VERY STRONG motivation signal (documented in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md)

**Assessment:** One syntax fix, otherwise excellent approach.

---

## **GROK APPROACHES**

### **Grok A: Slough-Style Mixed-Use - ✅ VALID**

**Technical:** All filters correct, proper date format (ISO), correct constraint syntax  
**Capital:** £150k-£200k (within budget)  
**Strategy:** Direct precedent replication, strong filter logic

**Assessment:** No issues - executable as written.

---

### **Grok B: Derelict Urban Turnaround - ❌ INVALID**

**CRITICAL BUSINESS CASE FAILURE:**

**The Math:**
- **Stated budget:** £100k-£150k
- **Stated strategy:** "Demolish and rebuild 8-storey mixed-use"
- **Actual 8-storey construction cost:** £10M-£15M
  - Industry standard: £2,000-£3,000/sqm
  - 8 storeys × 500 sqm/floor = 4,000 sqm
  - 4,000 sqm × £2,500/sqm = **£10,000,000**

**Gap: £9.85M-£14.85M UNFUNDED**

**Stated vs Reality:**
```
Stated:        Reality Needed:
£30-50k        £10-15M construction ❌
```

**Evidence:**
- Codex: "orders of magnitude too low"
- Gemini: "completely unrealistic... cost would be in the millions"
- My initial review: Missed this critical flaw

**Technical Issues:**
- Filter 2: Price currency format error

**Assessment:** Fundamental business case failure - cannot be executed as described. Requires full rewrite (either planning-stage exit strategy OR downscale to 2-3 storeys).

---

### **Grok C: PDR Mixed-Use Conversion - ⚠️ CONDITIONAL**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Filter 2:** `Title area (sqft): is greater than 100 AND less than 8000` ❌
   - **Problem:** "Title area (sqft)" DOES NOT EXIST
   - **Evidence:** SearchLand only has "Title area (acres)"
   - **Fix:** Convert units: `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25`
   - **Impact:** CRITICAL - filter will fail completely

2. **Missing filter:** Needs `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes`
   - **Evidence:** Price filters require market status pairing

3. **Filter 8:** Price currency format issue

**Class MA Validity:**
- **Gemini claims:** "Class MA not for 8-storey development"
- **Counter-evidence:** Class MA Part 20 (2021) DOES support upward extension (+2 storeys)
- **My assessment:** Gemini wrong on planning law, BUT 8-storey target unrealistic (Part 20 limited to +2 storeys = 6 total max)

**Assessment:** Critical unit error + missing filter + scope needs clarification.

---

## **ITERATION POSITION CHANGES**

### **Where I'm Changing Position:**

**Grok B: Was VALID → Now INVALID**
- ✅ Codex and Gemini correct - I missed construction cost failure
- £10M gap cannot be rationalized as "execution risk"
- Approach explicitly describes construction, not planning-only

**Currency/Date Formats: Acknowledging Uncertainty**
- Cannot definitively confirm without testing
- Codex likely correct on bare integers for prices
- Marking affected approaches CONDITIONAL pending Phase 1 testing

### **Where I'm Maintaining Position:**

**Grok C Class MA: Still CONDITIONAL (not INVALID)**
- Gemini wrong: Class MA Part 20 IS for airspace development
- SearchLand has "Percentage profit (Class MA only)" filter - validates strategy
- BUT unit error (sqft vs acres) is CRITICAL
- Maintained: CONDITIONAL due to unit error + scope clarification

**Gemini A Property Classification: Still CONDITIONAL**
- SearchLand lists Use Class and Property Classification as SEPARATE filters
- "Car park" is NOT a Use Class
- Filter mixing will cause rejection
- Maintained: CONDITIONAL (must split)

**Constraint Exclusion: Still requires fixes**
- NO "NOT:" operator in SearchLand
- NO "does not contain" for constraints
- Must use percentage-based filters
- Maintained: CRITICAL errors

---

## **PRIORITY TESTING ROADMAP**

### **Phase 1: Syntax Verification (Run First)**
1. **Price format:** `£2,000,000` vs `2000000` (affects 5 approaches)
2. **Date format:** `01/01/2016` vs `2016-01-01` (documented, affects 2)
3. **Use class abbreviations:** `E` vs full text (low priority, affects 1)

### **Phase 2: Approach Testing (After Fixes)**

**Tier 1: Test First ⭐**
1. Claude B (Airspace Rights) - VALID, cleanest
2. Grok A (Slough-Style) - VALID, strong precedent
3. Gemini B (Liquidation) - 1 easy fix, excellent motivation

**Tier 2: Strong Approaches**
4. Claude C (Liquidation)
5. Claude A (Precedent-Matched)
6. Codex A (Crossrail)

**Tier 3: More Work Needed**
7. Gemini A (Urban Intensification)
8. Codex B (High Street Podium)
9. Codex C (Stalled Resubmissions)
10. Grok C (PDR Conversion)

**Tier 4: Requires Rewrite**
11. Grok B (Derelict Turnaround) - INVALID

---

## **STRATEGIC DIVERSITY ✅**

Despite technical issues, strategic coverage is EXCELLENT:

- ✅ **Precedent-based:** Claude A, Codex A, Grok A
- ✅ **Capital-efficient:** Claude B (airspace), Gemini A (option), Grok C (PDR)
- ✅ **Motivation-driven:** Claude C & Gemini B (liquidation)
- ✅ **Regulation-driven:** Gemini B, Grok C (PDR)
- ✅ **Time arbitrage:** Codex C (stalled resubmissions)
- ✅ **Niche:** Codex B (podium intensification)

---

## **KEY FINDINGS**

### **Most Common Errors:**
1. Constraint exclusion syntax (NOT:, "does not contain") - 6 approaches
2. Price currency formatting - 5 approaches
3. Date formatting - 2 approaches
4. Filter taxonomy mixing - 1 approach

### **Strongest Approaches (Post-Fix):**
1. **Claude B** - Capital efficient (£88k), valid filters
2. **Grok A** - Direct precedent, valid filters
3. **Gemini B** - Liquidation signal, 1 easy fix
4. **Claude C** - High profit (£2.87M), 1 easy fix

### **Success Rate:**
- **70-80% will be VALID after fixes** (7-8 of 10 approaches)
- All meet £2M profit target (except Grok B)
- Capital range £88k-£200k achieved
- Strategic diversity maintained

---

**VALIDATION COMPLETE**  
**Overall Assessment:** Strong strategic foundation, mostly fixable technical issues  
**Confidence Level:** HIGH (post-fixes)  
**Next Step:** Phase 1 Syntax Testing → Apply Fixes → Phase 2 Parallel Testing

---

### Codex_Critique

### Codex - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The option-led Crossrail precedent is capital-feasible at £200k (option + studies) and aligns with the Slough ROI logic (60 units × £35k margin ≈ £2.1M; 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:126-158), but two syntax issues prevent the SearchLand query from running.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 8 relies on the undocumented `Planning constraints: does not contain Green Belt land`, even though SearchLand expects the percentage/area coverage filters for exclusions (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:133-142; 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:697-709; SearchlandContext/AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md:92-100).  
- Filter 10 keeps the `£2,000,000` price format with currency symbol/comma; the documented working syntax uses bare integers (LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:801-806).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace Filter 8 with `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0` (or ≤5%) so the exclusion uses a supported field (SearchlandContext/AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md:92-100).  
- Rewrite Filter 10 as `Sales listing price: is less than 2000000` to match SearchLand’s numeric input requirements (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:133-142; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:801-806).  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Strongest direct match to the Slough precedent; keep underwriting discipline when negotiating option deposits.

### Codex - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The airspace strategy meets capital (£190k) and ROI targets (70 units × £30k ≈ £2.1M; 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:161-193), but the query fails on pricing/date syntax.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 9 uses `Sales listing price: is less than £1,800,000`, which violates the bare-integer requirement (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:168-177; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:801-806).  
- Filter 10 specifies `Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2016`; SearchLand only accepts ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:168-177; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:698-705).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Enter price filters as `Sales listing price: is less than 1800000`.  
- Rewrite the date condition as `Latest sold date: is before 2016-01-01`.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Once syntax is corrected, phased rights-of-light work and retail pre-lets look executable within the £190k allowance.

### Codex - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The stalled-resubmission model keeps spend at £200k (option £140k + £60k consultants) with clear profit logic (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:196-228), but several filters are invalid.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filters 2 and 9 use `01/01/2023` and `01/01/2024`, which violate the ISO date format requirement (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:203-212; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:698-705).  
- Filter 10 again calls `Planning constraints: does not contain Flood Zone 3`, which SearchLand does not support (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:203-212; 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:697-709).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Rewrite the date filters as `Last application submitted: is before 2023-01-01` and `Last updated by Land Registry date: is before 2024-01-01`.  
- Swap Filter 10 for `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0` (or the acreage equivalent) per the available constraint filters (SearchlandContext/AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md:92-100).  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Good candidate for planning uplift flips, provided Section 106/CIL inheritance is stress-tested.

### Gemini - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** The off-market intensification plan fits the £200k option-and-planning budget and targets the right physical proxies (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:238-286), but two filters will fail.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 4 mixes valid strings with an invalid `Car park` value—SearchLand expects the full dropdown text such as `Car/coach/commercial vehicle/taxi parking`, `Public car parking`, or `Car park space` (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:244-253; SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:333-339).  
- Filter 8 uses `NOT: Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings`, which is unsupported (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:244-253; 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:697-709).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Limit Filter 4 to the exact use-class strings documented in SearchLand (e.g., `E`, `E(a)`, `Car/coach/commercial vehicle/taxi parking`, `Public car parking`, `Unused land`).  
- Replace the `NOT` statement with coverage filters such as `Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0` and `Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building: is equal to 0` (SearchlandContext/AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md:90-100).  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Maintaining an off-market focus differentiates this from the Codex/Grok on-market plays once filters compile.

### Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Targeting liquidation/administration sellers is a strong business thesis within £200k (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:290-336), but the Green Belt exclusion syntax blocks execution and ROI math is still implied rather than demonstrated.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 6 specifies `NOT: Green Belt land`, which SearchLand does not understand (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:296-304; 02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:697-709).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace Filter 6 with `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0` (or a minimal percentage) so constraint exclusion uses a supported field (SearchlandContext/AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md:92-100).  
- Add a short worked example (discounted purchase price vs. post-planning exit) to prove the £2M profit is achievable under forced-sale pricing assumptions (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:306-329).  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Keep legal budget for accelerated diligence; administrators may demand higher non-refundable deposits than assumed.

### Grok - Approach A: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Every filter exists with supported syntax (ISO dates, coverage equality) and aligns with the Slough precedent (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:342-357). The capital stack (options £10k-£50k + planning £20k-£40k) fits the £150k-£200k window, and the plan exits at planning to hit the £2M profit (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:375-388).  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- None.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Direct precedent matching plus staged option deposits makes this the cleanest “plug-and-play” route; continue monitoring LPAs for renewed appetite.

### Grok - Approach B: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Even if the filters compiled, the business case cannot deliver: the plan assumes demolition plus an 8-storey rebuild for £100k-£200k total spend (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:423-437), which is orders of magnitude below real-world costs, so the £2M profit is unattainable.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 2 uses `Sales listing price: is less than £150,000` without first filtering for active listings and with invalid currency formatting (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:395-404; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:168-176; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:801-806).  
- Construction budget/ROI math is fundamentally wrong—£30k-£50k for “initial construction” cannot produce or even meaningfully start an 8-storey mixed-use building (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:423-437).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A – approach needs a complete re-costing and new filter logic before it could be rehabilitated.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Consider reframing as a planning-lift/flip (like Grok A) rather than pretending to fund construction inside £150k.

### Grok - Approach C: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** The PDR conversion thesis cannot be executed as written: it references a `Title area (sqft)` filter that does not exist and relies on Class MA to create new “8-storey airspace,” which is outside the scope of permitted development in England (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:439-458; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:62-69).  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 2 (`Title area (sqft)`) is unsupported—SearchLand only exposes title area in acres (LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:62-69; SearchlandContext/AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md:10-22).  
- Filter 8 again uses `Sales listing price` with a `£120,000` value and omits the mandatory `Sales listing currently on the market` filter (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:446-454; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:168-176; LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:801-806).  
- Business logic assumes Class MA can add airspace floors, but the prior-approval route only converts existing E-class floor area; new storeys would still need full planning and far more than the £120k-£180k budget (02_VALIDITY_CHECK/critique_context.txt:456-458).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A – would require a wholesale rewrite (correct filters, realistic acquisition pricing, and a planning route that matches Class MA rules).  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- If you want a PDR play, focus on genuine office-to-residential conversions with proven Class MA capacities instead of airspace construction.

Next steps:
1. Apply the noted filter/date/price corrections to the CONDITIONAL approaches and rerun them in SearchLand to confirm they compile.  
2. Rework or replace the INVALID Grok B/C strategies with cost-realistic, syntactically valid briefs, then re-test alongside the already VALID/CONDITIONAL options.
 strategic diversity remains intact once the conditional items are corrected.
- Next steps: update the flagged filters (ISO dates, numeric prices, constraint exclusions, on-market pairing, acreage units) and rerun SearchLand queries before Stage 3 testing.

### Gemini_Critique

Loaded cached credentials.
### Claude - Approach A: Precedent-Matched Stalled Planning
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The approach is strategically sound, targeting sites with existing planning history that align with the precedent. However, the stated capital requirement range of £190k-£255k exceeds the £200k budget (+15% allowance, max £230k) at its upper end.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None identified in the provided prompt. The validation focuses on the summary table.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- The implementation strategy must explicitly target acquisitions and associated costs at the lower end of the estimated capital range to remain within the £230k budget ceiling.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- As a precedent-based approach, the business case is considered valid per the instructions. The capital range reflects negotiation uncertainty rather than a fundamental flaw.

---
### Claude - Approach B: Airspace Rights
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is fully compliant with the project constraints. The capital required (£88k-£170k) is well within the £200k budget, the strategy is coherent, and it leverages an established development model (airspace). No technical or business case issues were identified.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None identified.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

---
### Claude - Approach C: Liquidation Distressed Assets
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy to target distressed assets is strong due to high seller motivation. However, the capital requirement range of £180k-£357k is highly variable and significantly exceeds the £230k budget at its upper end. The approach is only viable under specific conditions.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None identified in the provided prompt.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- The implementation must focus on opportunities where acquisition and initial costs can be secured for under £230k. This requires careful selection and negotiation.

---
### Codex - Approach A: Crossrail Mixed-Use Precedents
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is sound, but the SearchLand AI prompt contains two technical syntax errors that will cause it to fail.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Filter 8:** `Planning constraints: does not contain Green Belt land` is invalid syntax.
- **Filter 10:** `Sales listing price: is less than £2,000,000` is an invalid format. Price filters require bare integers without currency symbols or commas.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- **Filter 8:** Change to `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0`.
- **Filter 10:** Change to `Sales listing price: is less than 2000000`.

---
### Codex - Approach B: High Street Podium Intensification
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is viable, but the prompt contains two blocking technical syntax errors related to date and price formatting.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Filter 9:** `Sales listing price: is less than £1,800,000` is an invalid format. It requires a bare integer.
- **Filter 10:** `Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2016` is an invalid date format. It must use the `YYYY-MM-DD` ISO format.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- **Filter 9:** Change to `Sales listing price: is less than 1800000`.
- **Filter 10:** Change to `Latest sold date: is before 2016-01-01`.

---
### Codex - Approach C: Stalled Mixed-Use Resubmissions
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** A strong precedent-based strategy that is undermined by multiple, easily fixable syntax errors in the prompt.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Filter 2 & 9:** `Last application submitted: is before 01/01/2023` and `Last updated by Land Registry date: is before 01/01/2024` use an invalid `DD/MM/YYYY` date format.
- **Filter 10:** `Planning constraints: does not contain Flood Zone 3` is invalid syntax.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- **Filter 2:** Change to `Last application submitted: is before 2023-01-01`.
- **Filter 9:** Change to `Last updated by Land Registry date: is before 2024-01-01`.
- **Filter 10:** Change to `Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0`.

---
### Gemini - Approach A: Urban Intensification via Option Agreement
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is sound, but the prompt contains two significant technical errors: it incorrectly mixes values from two different filters into one, and it uses invalid syntax for exclusions.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Filter 4:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Car park", ...` incorrectly combines a `Use class` value with `Property classification` values ("Car park", "Unused land"). These are separate filters in SearchLand.
- **Filter 8:** `NOT: Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings` is invalid syntax for excluding constraints.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- **Filter 4:** Split into two separate filters:
    - `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service"`
    - `Property classification: is one of "Car park", "Unused land"`
- **Filter 8:** Replace with two percentage-based filters:
    - `Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0`
    - `Area of title within 50m of a Listed Building (acres): is equal to 0` (or a similar percentage-based filter for listed buildings).

### Gemini - Approach B: Distressed Asset Acquisition (Forced Sale)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** This is a powerful, motivation-driven strategy that is technically sound except for one syntax error.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Filter 6:** `NOT: Green Belt land` is invalid syntax for an exclusion.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- **Filter 6:** Change to `Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0`.

### Grok - Approach A: Slough-Style Mixed-Use Intensification
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically and strategically sound. The SearchLand prompt uses filters that exist, with correct syntax, units, and date formats. The business case is precedent-based and therefore considered viable per the instructions.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

### Grok - Approach B: Derelict Urban Turnaround
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach has a fatal flaw in its business case. The proposed capital plan (£100k-£150k total) allocates only £30k-£50k for "initial construction" to deliver an 8-storey mixed-use building. This budget is unrealistic by orders of magnitude, making the entire "demolish and rebuild" strategy non-viable as written.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Filter 2:** `Sales listing price: is less than £150,000` uses an invalid format with a currency symbol and comma. It should be `150000`.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- The business case is not salvageable without a complete change in strategy (e.g., pivot to a planning-only flip) and a budget in the millions for construction.

---
### Grok - Approach C: Permitted Development Mixed-Use Conversion
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach fails on two fundamental points. First, it relies on a non-existent filter. Second, its core strategy is based on a misunderstanding of planning law.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Filter 2:** `Title area (sqft)` is a non-existent filter. The correct filter is `Title area (acres)`.
- **Filter 8:** `Sales listing price: is less than £120,000` uses an invalid format and is missing the required companion filter `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes`.

**Reasoning (Business Case):**
- The strategy to use Class MA PDR to create an "8-storey equivalent" is incorrect. Class MA allows for change of use and, under Part 20, upward extensions of typically only two storeys. It cannot be used for large-scale airspace development to achieve an 8-storey height from a standard commercial property.

### Claude - Approach A: Precedent-Matched Stalled Planning
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters mostly exist and syntax is largely correct, but constraint exclusion syntax is invalid per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md, price format may require bare integers, and capital upper bound exceeds +15% budget threshold. Business case auto-valid as precedent-based.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- Planning constraints: does not contain Green Belt land (invalid; use Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0)  
- Sales listing price: is less than £2,000,000 (may require bare integer 2000000)  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Replace constraint filter with percentage-based exclusion  
- Test and adjust price format to bare integer if needed  
**Strategic Notes:**  
- Strong precedent match; target lower capital range for feasibility  

### Claude - Approach B: Airspace Rights
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist, syntax correct, units accurate, capital within budget, ROI achievable via airspace intensification, implementation viable through negotiation.  
**Technical Issues:**
