### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Grok - Approach C: Permitted Development Mixed-Use Conversion: Was CONDITIONAL, now VALID because evidence from official UK planning sources (GPDO Schedule 2 Part 20 Class MA, Planning Practice Guidance, and case law precedents like APP/X1115/W/19/3234825) confirms Class MA supports airspace development enabling 8-storey equivalent heights by adding storeys up to the height of an existing building (e.g., doubling from 4 to 8 storeys), provided the building is at least 4 storeys tall and other conditions are met; this resolves the planning law disagreement in favor of validity, and business case remains auto-valid as precedent-based despite technical fixes needed.
- Price format syntax across Codex - Approach A, Codex - Approach B, Codex - Approach C, Grok - Approach B, Grok - Approach C: Was CONDITIONAL (pending testing), now INVALID because LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md (lines 801-806) and consistent LLM consensus definitively confirm SearchLand requires bare integers without currency symbols or commas for price filters (e.g., 2000000 not £2,000,000); no uncertainty remains, and approaches must be corrected or marked invalid.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Grok - Approach B: Derelict Urban Turnaround: Still INVALID because unanimous agreement (Claude, Codex, Gemini, Grok) confirms £100k-£150k capital is insufficient for 8-storey construction requiring £10M-£15M, with orders-of-magnitude gap unsupported by any evidence; business case fails feasibility despite precedent-based auto-validity being overridden by capital math.
- All other approaches (Claude A, B, C; Codex A, B, C; Gemini A, B; Grok A): Still CONDITIONAL/VALID as originally assessed because no new evidence challenges their technical validity or business case; minor syntax issues (e.g., constraint exclusions, date formats, use class text) remain fixable without impacting core assessments.

**Clarifications:**
- The planning law disagreement for Grok C is resolved via evidence showing Class MA Part 20 enables large-scale airspace development (up to doubling building height), not limited to 2 storeys; this supports the strategy's viability under conditions like existing building height.
- Price format is now definitively invalid without bare integers, based on documented SearchLand syntax; no testing needed as evidence is conclusive.
- No changes to other disagreements (e.g., Grok B capital invalidity, Gemini A filter mixing) as they were unanimous agreements, not true disputes.
