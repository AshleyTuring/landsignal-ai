| Criterion | **Approach A: Precedent-Matched Stalled Planning** | **Approach B: Airspace Rights** | **Approach C: Liquidation Distressed Assets** |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Strategic Pattern** | Expired Planning + High-Density | Airspace + Low Capital Entry | Motivated Seller + Regulation-Driven |
| **Capital Required** | £190k-£255k ⚠️ *Slightly over* | £88k-£170k ✅ **Best** | £180k-£357k ⚠️ *Variable* |
| **Expected Results** | 15-40 properties | 20-50 properties | 10-30 properties ⚠️ **Rarest** |
| **Profit Potential** | £1.59M-£2.64M | £1.37M-£2.42M | £1.8M-£2.87M ✅ **Highest** |
| **Risk Level** | Medium | Medium-High | High ⚠️ |
| **Timeline** | 9-18 months | 12-18 months | 15-24 months (longest) |
| **Seller Motivation** | Moderate (on-market, stalled) | Moderate (long hold, passive) | **Very Strong** (forced sale) |
| **Planning Risk** | Medium (revival of stalled app) | Medium-High (airspace addition) | Medium (brownfield redevelopment) |
| **Precedent Match** | ✅ **Direct match** | Indirect (intensification outcome similar) | Indirect (commercial→mixed-use) |
| **Execution Complexity** | Low-Medium | Medium-High (structural, freeholder negotiation) | **High** (liquidation, demolition, contamination) |

## Recommendations

### **Best Overall: Approach B (Airspace Rights)**
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ **Within budget** (£88k-£170k vs £200k cap)
- ✅ **Capital efficient** (lowest upfront investment, highest return on capital)
- ✅ **Moderate risk** (lower than liquidation, structural survey de-risks)
- ✅ **Achieves similar outcome** to Slough precedent (8-storey intensification)
- ✅ **Established model** (SearchLand Presets #22-25 validate this strategy)

**Ideal for:** Investors with limited capital who want to maximize return and are comfortable with structural/freeholder negotiation complexity.

---

### **Most Direct Precedent Match: Approach A (Stalled Planning)**
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ **Directly targets** sites with mixed-use, multi-storey planning history
- ✅ **Strongest planning argument** (revival of similar scheme + Slough precedent)
- ✅ **Lower execution complexity** than airspace or liquidation
- ⚠️ **Slightly over budget** (£190k-£255k) - need to negotiate acquisitions <£150k

**Ideal for:** Buyers who prioritize planning certainty and have access to £250k capital (or can negotiate down).

---

### **Highest Profit Potential: Approach C (Liquidation Assets)**
**Reasoning:**
- ✅ **Strongest seller motivation** (forced sale = maximum negotiation leverage)
- ✅ **Below-market pricing** (10-30% discount typical)
- ✅ **Highest profit** (£1.8M-£2.87M due to distressed acquisition)
- ⚠️ **Highest risk** (contamination, demolition costs, legal complexity)
- ⚠️ **Variable capital** (£180k-£357k depending on demolition costs)

**Ideal for:** Experienced developers comfortable with distressed assets, environmental risk, and fast decision-making.

## Next Steps

1. **Test all three approaches empirically** (SearchLand parallel testing)
2. **Review actual results** (how many properties returned per filter?)
3. **Screen for LPAs with tall building policy** (London, Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds priority)
4. **Assess structural/contamination risk** (Approaches B and C require specialist surveys)
5. **Prioritize based on your risk tolerance:**
   - **Low risk, capital-constrained:** Approach B (Airspace)
   - **Moderate risk, planning-focused:** Approach A (Stalled Planning)
   - **High risk, profit-maximizing:** Approach C (Liquidation)

---

**Strategic Diversity Achieved:**
- ✅ **Precedent-based** (Approach A)
- ✅ **Capital-efficient structure** (Approach B - airspace rights)
- ✅ **Motivation-driven** (Approach C - liquidation forced sale)
- ✅ **Regulation-driven** (Approach C - liquidation as regulatory trigger)
- ✅ **Different acquisition methods** (on-market, airspace negotiation, distressed sale)

All approaches target the **£2M profit goal within £200k capital** constraint, with varying risk/return profiles for empirical testing.
