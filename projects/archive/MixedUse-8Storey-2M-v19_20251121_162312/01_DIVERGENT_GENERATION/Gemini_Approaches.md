## Approach A: Urban Intensification via Option Agreement

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A (High-Density/Intensification) + Pattern 4B (Low Capital Entry Strategies)
**Capital Required:** £200,000 (for option fee & planning costs)
**Expected Results:** 10-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
4. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Car park", "Car/coach/commercial vehicle/taxi parking", "Unused land"
5. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
6. Ownership type: is one of Company, Private owner
7. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
8. NOT: Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets properties similar to the 8-storey mixed-use precedent. The strategy is to find under-developed, low-rise properties in high-accessibility urban locations (proxied by train station distance, as PTAL is London-only) that have the potential for significant height and density uplift. By targeting off-market sites (Rule 5), the goal is to use a low-capital option agreement (Pattern 4B) to secure the land. The £200k capital is not for acquisition but to fund the option and the planning process to unlock the £2M profit. The precedent in Slough demonstrates that LPAs in such areas are amenable to high-density development, reducing planning risk. The height filter `<12m` targets sites with 1-3 storey buildings, offering maximum intensification potential, as per `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`.

**Strengths:**
- Directly leverages a successful planning precedent, reducing planning risk.
- Low capital outlay for control of a high-value asset via an option agreement.
- Targets off-market properties, avoiding competition and inflated prices.
- High potential for value uplift by securing a valuable planning consent.
- Clear development potential based on physical and location-based attributes.

**Limitations:**
- Success is heavily dependent on successful negotiation of an option agreement with the landowner.
- Planning is never guaranteed, even with a strong precedent.
- Requires significant expertise in planning and development to realize the value.
- Landowners of well-located sites may already be aware of their development potential.
- The process is long, typically 12-24 months to secure planning.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the SearchLand query to identify a shortlist of 10-50 target properties.
2.  Conduct desktop due diligence on the top 5-10 sites to verify constraints and ownership.
3.  Approach the landowners directly with a well-researched proposal for an option agreement, contingent on securing planning permission for an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.
4.  Negotiate and sign an option agreement, paying an option fee from the capital budget.
5.  Assemble a professional team (architects, planning consultants) and submit a planning application.
6.  Once planning is granted, either exercise the option and sell the site with consent to a major developer for a £2M+ profit, or sell the option itself.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee (non-refundable): £75,000
- Planning Application & Professional Fees (Architects, Consultants): £90,000
- Legal Fees (Option & Planning): £20,000
- Contingency: £15,000
- **Total:** £200,000

## Approach B: Distressed Asset Acquisition (Forced Sale)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales) + Pattern 4B (Low Capital Entry Strategies)
**Capital Required:** £200,000 (for option fee & due diligence)
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 10
4. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
5. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
6. NOT: Green Belt land
```

**Rationale:**
This approach uses a completely different, motivation-driven strategy. It leverages the "Company status" filter to find assets being sold by liquidators or administrators. As identified in `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`, this is a "VERY STRONG motivation signal" indicating a forced sale. The liquidator is legally obligated to sell and is motivated by speed and certainty, making them receptive to creative deals like option agreements. This strategy targets larger, potentially derelict sites (Rule 4) that have significant underlying value but are distressed. The £200k capital is used to secure the site and perform due diligence, with the aim of acquiring a valuable asset at a steep discount to achieve the £2M profit target upon securing planning and reselling.

**Strengths:**
- Targets highly motivated sellers with a legal obligation to dispose of assets.
- Strong potential to acquire assets significantly below market value.
- Reduced competition as many buyers are unable to handle distressed/complex assets.
- The buyer has a strong negotiating position due to the seller's circumstances.
- Can uncover unique, high-potential sites that are not openly marketed.

**Limitations:**
- The pool of properties in liquidation/administration is small and highly sought after.
- Assets may have significant legal, structural, or contamination issues requiring costly due diligence.
- Liquidators often prefer unconditional cash offers, so an option agreement must be compelling.
- The process can be legally complex and require specialist advice.
- The underlying asset may be undesirable, hence the company's failure.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  Run the SearchLand query to identify a shortlist of distressed assets.
2.  Immediately contact the appointed liquidator/administrator for the most promising sites to register interest.
3.  Move quickly to conduct initial due diligence to assess the viability and key risks of the asset.
4.  Structure a compelling offer, potentially a short-term option or an exchange with a delayed completion, using a significant portion of the capital as a non-refundable deposit to demonstrate commitment.
5.  Negotiate hard on price, leveraging the distressed nature of the sale.
6.  Once control is secured, create a business plan to either flip the asset to a developer, or use the remaining capital to pursue a planning application to add value before selling.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Exclusivity Deposit / Option Fee: £100,000
- Legal & Due Diligence Fees (for complex asset): £50,000
- Initial Feasibility & Planning Reports: £35,000
- Contingency: £15,000
- **Total:** £200,000
