### Approach A: Crossrail Mixed-Use Precedents
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5 – High-Density/Intensification (transport-led towers with retail podiums)  
**Capital Required:** £200k (Option premium £150k on <£2M guide + planning/technical studies £50k)  
**Expected Results:** 18-30 titles along Elizabeth Line / GWML towns

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.20
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than or equal to 60
4. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than or equal to 6
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than or equal to 1
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than or equal to 600
7. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than or equal to 20
8. Planning constraints: does not contain Green Belt land
9. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
10. Sales listing price: is less than £2,000,000
```

**Rationale:** Mirrors the approved Slough brief by isolating sites that already secured tall mixed-use permissions near fast rail. A <£2M land ticket keeps a 10% option premium within the £200k cap while 60+ dwellings at £35k margin/unit sustain the £2M profit target through a build-to-sell exit.

**Strengths:**  
- On-market, consented schemes shorten delivery and de-risk planning.  
- Verified tall-building precedents around Crossrail/SWR corridors strengthen committee arguments.  
- Price ceiling aligns deposit + fees with available capital.

**Limitations:**  
- Relies on public listings; strong schemes sold off-market are missed.  
- Requires careful diligence on Section 106/CIL inherited from prior consent.  
- Tight transport radius biases toward Southern England stock.

**Implementation Strategy:** Export shortlist, underwrite GDV/cost inflation quickly, then table conditional offers with 6–12 month completion so the £150k option deposit and £50k consultant budget re-optimize layouts (e.g., add co-working retail) before funding construction debt/equity.

### Approach B: High Street Podium Intensification
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3 – Development Opportunity (underbuilt urban retail for vertical expansion)  
**Capital Required:** £190k (Heads of terms/option £120k + design & rights of light envelope studies £70k)  
**Expected Results:** 25-40 parades in commuter towns and outer London borough centres

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b)
2. Max number of building floors on title: is less than or equal to 3
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.70
4. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than or equal to 40
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than or equal to 400
6. Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m): is less than or equal to 150
7. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is less than or equal to 10
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
9. Sales listing price: is less than £1,800,000
10. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2016
```

**Rationale:** The Slough approval showed planners accept eight-storey massing when ground-floor E-class uses are retained. This filter grabs long-held, low-rise podiums beside strong public transport, where topping up to 6–8 residential storeys can generate ~70 units @ £30k margin/unit = £2.1M, while site control only needs a sub-£1.8M capital value (≤£180k option plus fees).

**Strengths:**  
- Targets owners fatigued after 8+ year holds yet still active on-market.  
- Hardstanding-heavy plots simplify construction phasing over trading retail.  
- Transport proximity underpins high-density viability and lender comfort.

**Limitations:**  
- Requires intricate construction sequencing to keep retail trading.  
- Rights-of-light and daylight objections likely; consultant spend must be staged.  
- PTAL proxy outside London replaced by distance filters, so manual sense-checks needed.

**Implementation Strategy:** Prioritize parades inside Levelling-Up town centres (Slough, Reading, Watford). Secure short-dated option, complete bulk/massing study (£40k) + vertical circulation concept (£30k), then pre-let flexible Class E at ground to evidence active frontage before submitting full application for air-rights build.

### Approach C: Stalled Mixed-Use Resubmissions
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1 – Expired/Stalled Planning (refresh older approvals with stronger viability case)  
**Capital Required:** £200k (Resubmission + consultant team £60k, option premium £140k to re-engage owners)  
**Expected Results:** 10-18 dormant approvals across Thames Valley, Midlands metros, and Scottish city cores

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
2. Last application submitted: is before 01/01/2023
3. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than or equal to 2
4. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than or equal to 50
5. Ownership type: is Company
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.20 AND less than 1.00
7. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than or equal to 25
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than or equal to 800
9. Last updated by Land Registry date: is before 01/01/2024
10. Planning constraints: does not contain Flood Zone 3
```

**Rationale:** Focuses on companies that secured sizeable mixed-use permissions like the Slough scheme but let them lapse post-2022. Re-running the design with current cost/ESG inputs typically gains extra sellable NIA, lifting residual value enough to capture circa £2M uplift while needing only an option deposit and a fresh consultant spend.

**Strengths:**  
- Existing design packs and studies shorten resubmission timeline.  
- Company vendors tend to prefer certainty and are open to deferred completions.  
- Transport-proximate, largely hardstanding sites align with policy favoring brownfield intensification.

**Limitations:**  
- Some lapsed schemes fail because of fundamental viability flaws; detailed cost audit essential.  
- Land Registry updates lag, so additional diligence gridding may be required.  
- Need credibility with planning authorities to be trusted with resubmission.

**Implementation Strategy:** Map results against Slough/South-East precedent notes, call directors with a proposal to fund resubmission, pay £140k option premium for exclusivity, deploy £60k on architecture/viability refresh, then flip into JV or forward-fund sale once new consent secured.

Next steps: 1) Run each prompt in SearchLand and tag outputs by approach, 2) sanity-check pricing/height data via title PDFs, and 3) open discussions with shortlisted owners using the option-and-resubmit narrative aligned to the £200k capital plan.
