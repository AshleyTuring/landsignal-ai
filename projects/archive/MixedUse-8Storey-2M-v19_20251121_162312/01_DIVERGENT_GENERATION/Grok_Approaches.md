### Approach A: Slough-Style Mixed-Use Intensification
**Strategic Pattern:** High-Density/Intensification (Pattern 5A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
5. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
8. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets properties with planning precedents similar to the Slough 8-storey mixed-use application, focusing on stalled high-density developments. By identifying sites with old mixed-use/storey proposals and minimal recent activity, we find opportunities where planning groundwork exists but projects stalled. The Slough precedent shows approval for 8-storey mixed-use (retail + residential), so we prioritize similar density (20+ dwellings) and accessibility (near train stations). This fits Pattern 5A's strategy of low-rise sites in high-accessibility areas suitable for intensification, with capital constraints met through option agreements or distressed purchases.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching to approved Slough scheme (8-storey mixed-use)
- Planning derisked with existing proposals for high-density development
- Low capital entry via option agreements (£10k-£50k deposits)
- High profit potential from completing stalled projects (£2M target achievable with 8-10 storey additions)
- Targets inactive buildings, indicating motivated sellers

**Limitations:**
- Limited to sites with existing planning history (may miss greenfield opportunities)
- Geographic concentration around transport hubs (fewer results outside urban areas)
- Requires planning expertise to revive stalled applications
- Competition from developers already pursuing similar precedents

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 20-40 sites with stalled mixed-use planning near transport.
2. Research planning history via local authority portals to confirm similarity to Slough approval.
3. Approach owners with option proposals (£10k-£20k deposits) contingent on planning revival.
4. Secure planning permission for 8+ storeys (6-12 months timeline).
5. Sell to housebuilder or developer at planning stage for £2M+ profit.
6. Monitor for fresh planning consents to time purchases advantageously.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option deposits: £10,000-£50,000
- Planning application fees: £20,000-£40,000
- Legal/due diligence: £10,000-£20,000
- Contingency: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £150,000-£200,000

### Approach B: Derelict Urban Turnaround
**Strategic Pattern:** Low Capital Entry (Pattern 4C from FILTER_PATTERNS.md)  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£150,000  
**Expected Results:** 15-35 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than £150,000
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
6. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2: is equal to 0
8. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This completely different strategy from precedent-based approaches focuses on severely derelict properties in accessible urban locations, suitable for demolition and rebuild to mixed-use. Unlike the Slough-focused approach, this targets distressed assets with low acquisition costs, allowing rebuild to 8-storey mixed-use similar to the precedent but without relying on existing planning. Pattern 4C emphasizes derelict sites near transport for redevelopment, fitting the £200k capital limit through discounted pricing and phased construction. The profit target is achievable by buying derelict for £100k-£150k, rebuilding to £300k-£400k, and selling for £2M+.

**Strengths:**
- Very low acquisition costs due to derelict status (strong motivation signals)
- No reliance on existing planning (flexible redevelopment to match Slough precedent)
- High profit margins from distressed pricing to market value
- Freehold tenure simplifies ownership and redevelopment
- Transport proximity ensures viability for mixed-use (retail + residential)

**Limitations:**
- Derelict properties may have hidden structural issues requiring surveys (£5k-£15k)
- Planning still required for 8-storey development (not guaranteed)
- Limited to small plots (0.05-0.25 acres) constraining scale
- Urban focus may face local opposition or conservation constraints

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for derelict freehold sites under £150k near transport hubs.
2. Conduct structural surveys and environmental assessments (£10k-£20k).
3. Purchase directly or via option (£50k-£100k total acquisition).
4. Demolish and rebuild to 8-storey mixed-use (12-18 months, £100k-£200k construction).
5. Obtain planning permission for flexible retail/residential use.
6. Sell completed development for £2M+ profit.
7. Phase construction to stay within capital limits.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition: £50,000-£100,000
- Surveys/due diligence: £10,000-£20,000
- Demolition: £10,000-£20,000
- Initial construction phase: £30,000-£50,000
- **Total:** £100,000-£150,000

### Approach C: Permitted Development Mixed-Use Conversion
**Strategic Pattern:** Permitted Development Rights (Pattern 7A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md)  
**Capital Required:** £120,000-£180,000  
**Expected Results:** 25-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
2. Title area (sqft): is greater than 100 AND less than 8000
3. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Percentage of title covered by Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB): is equal to 0
6. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is equal to 0
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
8. Sales listing price: is less than £120,000
```

**Rationale:**
This alternative strategy leverages Class MA PDR to convert commercial buildings to mixed-use residential above retail, creating 8-storey equivalents through airspace development. Unlike the precedent approach, this uses regulation-driven rights for faster execution without full planning. Pattern 7A targets E-class commercial sites eligible for residential conversion, with capital constraints met via low acquisition costs. The Slough precedent's mixed-use (retail + residential) is replicated through PDR, achieving £2M profit by converting undervalued commercial to high-value mixed-use.

**Strengths:**
- PDR bypasses full planning (faster 6-12 months vs 12-24 months)
- Low capital for commercial-to-residential conversion
- Targets inactive commercial buildings (motivated sellers)
- Transport proximity ensures mixed-use viability
- SearchLand calculates profit automatically for Class MA

**Limitations:**
- Limited to E-class commercial (2-year use requirement)
- Size restrictions (<8,000 sqft title area)
- Excluded from AONB, conservation areas, and flood zones
- May require prior approval for larger conversions

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for eligible E-class commercial sites under £120k near transport.
2. Verify 2-year E-class use and PDR eligibility via local authority.
3. Purchase freehold or secure option (£50k-£100k).
4. Apply for Class MA prior approval (3-6 months).
5. Convert to mixed-use with residential above retail (6-12 months, £50k-£80k costs).
6. Sell for £2M+ profit as completed development.
7. Use SearchLand's Class MA profit calculator for valuation.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition: £50,000-£100,000
- Prior approval application: £5,000-£10,000
- Conversion works: £50,000-£80,000
- Legal/fees: £15,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £120,000-£180,000
