# Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M

**Created:** 2025-01-19
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Converged

## Quick Summary
Find 8-storey mixed-use development opportunities to generate £2M profit from £200k capital

## Requirements
- Type 1: £2,000,000 profit from £200,000 capital (10x ROI)
- Type 2: Similar to "8-storey mixed-use development with retail (E) and residential (C3)"
- Priority: High - Need precise matches
- Expected results: Narrow (10-50 properties per filter)

## Capital Available
£200,000

## Target Profit
£2,000,000 (10x ROI)

## Iterations Log
- Iteration 1: Started 2025-01-19
  - Gemini: Created 3 initial filters (urban redevelopment, expired planning, airspace)
  - Codex: Found MAJOR ISSUES (height wrong, capital mismatch, missing policy filters)
  - Claude: Refined filters but PREMATURELY declared convergence ❌
  
- Iteration 2: Validation (MANDATORY)
  - Gemini: MAJOR CHANGES needed (15m too low, £150k purchase unrealistic, missing motivation)
  - Codex: MAJOR CHANGES confirmed (policy gaps, height errors, Filter 3 fundamentally flawed)
  - Claude: Implemented all fixes (height 25-35m, option agreements, policy zones, motivation signals)
  
- Iteration 3: Final validation
  - Gemini: All concerns addressed - AGREE ✅
  - Codex: Convergence solid - AGREE ✅
  - Status: CONVERGED after 3 iterations

## Convergence
- Iterations required: 3
- Final agreement: All LLMs (Gemini, Codex, Claude) explicitly agreed
- Date converged: 2025-01-19

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Height Requirements:** Changed from 15-30m to 25-35m for Filter 1 (match 8-storey reality)
2. **Filter 3 Strategy:** Changed from £150k purchase to option agreement (capital realistic)
3. **Policy Support:** Added tall building zones, PTAL 4-6, HDT failures (all filters)
4. **Motivation Signals:** Made specific (listed >12mo, price reduced, expired leases, old sales)
5. **Iteration Rule:** Established minimum 2 iterations after catching premature convergence

## Final Filters
- Filter 1: Tall Building Zone Option Agreements (10-20 properties, £2M-£3.5M profit)
- Filter 2: Expired 8-Storey Planning + Market Motivation (5-12 properties, £2.5M-£4M profit) ⭐ HIGHEST PRIORITY
- Filter 3: Airspace-Ready Option Agreements (15-25 properties, £1.5M-£2.5M profit)

## Implementation
- Start date: Pending
- SearchLand results: Not yet run
- Actual property count: TBD
- Priority order: Filter 2 → Filter 1 → Filter 3

## Lessons Learned

### Critical Lessons (Added to MASTER)
1. **Never trust 1 iteration:** First iteration had fundamental flaws that only appeared in Iteration 2
2. **Height calculations matter:** 15m ≠ 8 storeys (only 4-5 storeys). Always: storeys × 3m
3. **Capital reality check:** £200k cannot buy properties - must use options/conditional contracts
4. **Policy context essential:** Tall building zones, PTAL, HDT critical for planning success
5. **Specific beats generic:** "Distress signals" too vague - need "listed >12mo", "price reduced", etc.

### Technical Discoveries
- 8 storeys = ~24-28m height minimum (3m per floor + ground floor extra)
- £200k capital allocation: Options £50-75k, Planning £50-75k, Contingency £50-75k
- PTAL 4-6 essential for 8-storey density approvals in urban areas
- Housing Delivery Test failures create more receptive planning authorities

### LLM Patterns Observed
- Gemini: Good concepts, but misses technical details (height math)
- Codex: Catches mathematical/technical errors, identifies capital mismatches
- Claude: Synthesizes well but can be overconfident (premature convergence risk)

### Filter Design Patterns
- Multiple distress signals better than one (property status + market + lease)
- Policy support filters reduce planning risk (tall building zones, PTAL)
- Expired planning = precedent established (highest value opportunity)
- Option agreements realistic for <£500k capital (vs direct purchase)

## Success Metrics
✅ Minimum 2 iterations completed (did 3)
✅ All LLMs explicitly agreed
✅ All requirements addressed
✅ Capital allocation realistic
✅ Technical parameters correct (height, area)
✅ Policy context included
✅ Motivation signals specific
✅ SearchLand prompts ready
✅ Implementation order defined
✅ Geographic focus identified
✅ Fully documented and archived
