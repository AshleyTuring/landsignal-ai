## Recommended Filters

### Filter 1: Tall Building Zone Option Agreements

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
Find freehold or leasehold commercial properties with Use Class E, E(a), or E(g)(i) 
that are between 25-35 meters in building height and 400-1,500 square meters in area.
Focus on properties in areas with PTAL 4, 5, 6a, or 6b. The property must be within 
a Tall Building Policy Zone or designated Opportunity Area. Include areas where the 
local authority has failed or marginally passed the Housing Delivery Test. Include 
only properties classified as vacant, derelict, or inactive, OR with expired or 
expiring commercial lettings within 12 months, OR listed for sale for more than 12 
months, OR with price reductions. The property should have last sold more than 5 years 
ago and be owned by a company or corporate entity. Exclude properties in conservation 
areas, with listed buildings, or with Article 4 restrictions.
```

**Based On:**
- [x] Modification of Preset #68 (Offices with no C3) + distress criteria
- [x] Custom policy zone filters

**Key Criteria:**
- Height: 25-35m (8-12 storeys - ALREADY at target scale)
- Tall Building Policy Zones or Opportunity Areas (planning de-risked)
- Housing Delivery Test: Failed/marginal (increases planning appetite)
- Multiple distress signals:
  - Property status: Vacant, Derelict, Inactive
  - Commercial leases: Expired or expiring <12 months
  - Sales: Listed >12 months OR price reduced
  - Latest sold: >5 years ago
- Company/Corporate ownership (more commercial negotiation)

**Expected Results:**
- Estimated property count: 10-20 properties
- Geographic coverage: London, Manchester, Birmingham (policy-supported tall building areas)

**Justification:**
This filter targets buildings ALREADY at 8-storey scale (25-35m) in areas with explicit policy support for tall buildings. The combination of policy support (tall building zones, HDT failures) and distress signals (vacant, expired leases, long listings) creates negotiating leverage for option agreements. £200k capital allocated to £75k option fees allows securing rights without full purchase.

**Strengths:**
- Buildings already at target height (no uplift risk)
- Policy support de-risks planning
- Multiple distress indicators increase success rate
- Option agreement strategy realistic for £200k
- HDT failures make councils more receptive to development

**Limitations:**
- Very narrow search (10-20 properties estimated)
- Policy zones primarily in major cities
- Requires sophisticated deal structuring
- Need development partner for execution

**Recommended Tweaks:**
- To broaden results: Reduce height to 20-35m, include PTAL 3+
- To narrow results: London only, add "Number of addresses: 1-3" (simpler buildings)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify 8-12 target properties in tall building zones
2. Desktop due diligence: policy review, planning history, structural reports
3. Approach with option agreement: £50-75k for 18-24 month option
4. Use £75k for planning application within tall building zone
5. £50k contingency for surveys, legal, negotiation
6. Expected ROI: 10-15x through option-to-JV structure with institutional developer

**Capital Breakdown:**
- £75k: Option fee (1-2 properties)
- £75k: Planning application + pre-app consultations
- £50k: Due diligence, legal, contingency
- **Total: £200k**

### Filter 2: Expired 8-Storey Planning + Market Motivation

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
Find freehold properties where planning applications have expired or lapsed, and the 
proposal description contains "8-storey" or "eight storey" AND "mixed-use" AND 
"residential" or "C3". The maximum building height applied for should be greater than 
20 meters. The last application should have been submitted 1-4 years ago. Property 
area should be 800-2,500 square meters. The property must be within a Tall Building 
Policy Zone or designated Opportunity Area, and have PTAL 4, 5, 6a, or 6b. The property 
should be listed for sale for more than 12 months OR have had a price reduction. The 
latest sold date should be more than 3 years ago or have no recent sale. Ownership 
should be private owner or company, not institutional. Exclude properties under active 
construction or under offer.
```

**Based On:**
- [x] Modified from Iteration 1 Gemini concept
- [x] Incorporates Codex height corrections and policy filters
- [x] Gemini's market motivation signals

**Key Criteria:**
- Expired planning for "8-storey mixed-use" (precedent established)
- Height applied >20m (actual 8-storey requirement)
- Application 1-4 years ago (recent enough to be relevant)
- NEW: Listed >12 months OR price reduced (vendor motivation)
- NEW: PTAL 4-6 (transport supports density)
- NEW: Tall Building Policy Zone (planning support)
- 800-2,500 sqmt (viable development scale)
- Private/Company ownership (not institutional - more flexible)

**Expected Results:**
- Estimated property count: 5-12 properties
- Geographic coverage: London, major cities with tall building policies

**Justification:**
This is the HIGHEST VALUE filter. It identifies sites where the principle of 8-storey mixed-use has already been approved by planning authority. Combined with market motivation (long listing, price reductions) and policy support, this creates the perfect storm for a discounted conditional contract. The expired planning de-risks the development pathway while vendor's sunk costs create negotiating leverage.

**Strengths:**
- Planning precedent dramatically reduces risk
- Exact match to "8-storey mixed-use" requirement
- Vendor motivation from sunk costs + market factors
- Policy support ensures planning context hasn't changed
- Highest profit potential (£2.5M-£4M)

**Limitations:**
- Extremely narrow search (5-12 properties expected)
- Need to understand why planning lapsed
- Vendors may still have high expectations despite expired planning
- Requires vendor finance or conditional contract structuring

**Recommended Tweaks:**
- To broaden results: Include "7-storey" and "9-storey" keywords, extend to 5 years
- To narrow results: London only, add "Price reduced >10%"

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify 5-8 target properties with expired 8-storey planning
2. Research lapse reasons (funding collapsed, market timing, owner circumstances)
3. Analyze original planning application (viable scheme or needed work?)
4. Approach with conditional contract: £100k deposit, balance on refreshed planning
5. Use £50k to refresh/improve planning application
6. £50k contingency for negotiations, legal, surveys
7. Expected ROI: 15-20x due to de-risked planning + vendor motivation

**Capital Breakdown:**
- £100k: Deposit on conditional contract
- £50k: Planning application refresh + improvements
- £50k: Due diligence, legal, contingency
- **Total: £200k**

### Filter 3: Airspace-Ready Option Agreements

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
Find freehold properties with Use Class E that have been in Class E for more than 2 
years. Properties must have flat roofs and be between 18-25 meters in building height 
(approximately 6-8 storeys). The title area should be 400-1,200 square meters, with 
developed area percentage greater than 70%. Properties must be within 100 meters of 
a Tall Building Policy Zone boundary OR within a designated Opportunity Area, and have 
PTAL 4, 5, 6a, or 6b. Distance to nearest train or tube station should be less than 
800 meters. Latest EPC rating should be D, E, F, or G. The property must have zero 
leaseholds. The property should have last sold more than 3 years ago OR have an expired 
commercial lease. Exclude properties in areas with Article 4 restrictions or conservation 
areas.
```

**Based On:**
- [x] Modification of Preset #4 (Class MA) + #23 (Airspace)
- [x] Changed from purchase to option agreement (Iteration 2 fix)
- [x] Added policy proximity and PTAL (Iteration 2 additions)

**Key Criteria:**
- Height: 18-25m (6-8 storeys - ALREADY NEAR TARGET)
- Class E for >2 years (Class MA eligible)
- Flat roof (airspace development ready)
- NEW: Within 100m of tall building zones OR in Opportunity Area
- NEW: PTAL 4-6 (transport density)
- NEW: Option agreement strategy (not purchase)
- Poor EPC D-G (under-investment signals)
- Sold >3 years ago OR expired lease (motivation)
- Zero leaseholds (clean title)
- 400-1,200 sqmt (realistic scale)

**Expected Results:**
- Estimated property count: 15-25 properties
- Geographic coverage: London, regional cities with good rail connections

**Justification:**
This filter targets buildings ALREADY at 6-8 storeys (18-25m) adjacent to tall building policy areas. The combination of existing height, flat roof, Class MA eligibility, and policy proximity creates a hybrid pathway: use Class MA for de-risked ground floor conversion while planning application adds 1-2 floors to reach full 8-storey target. Option agreements on distressed assets (poor EPC, old sale, expired lease) make this achievable within £200k budget.

**Strengths:**
- Buildings already close to target (6-8 storeys)
- Hybrid Class MA + planning reduces risk
- Policy proximity supports height increase
- Option agreements realistic for budget
- Larger result set provides diversification
- Poor EPC + motivation signals = negotiating leverage

**Limitations:**
- Two-stage process (Class MA then planning) adds complexity
- Policy "proximity" (100m) not same as being "within" zone
- May only reach 7-8 storeys, not guaranteed full 8
- Airspace structural feasibility not fully filtered

**Recommended Tweaks:**
- To broaden results: Include 15-25m height range, expand to 200m policy proximity
- To narrow results: "Within Opportunity Area" only (not proximity), add PTAL 5-6 only

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify 12-18 target properties at 18-25m height
2. Focus on properties near tall building zones with poor EPC
3. Structural pre-assessment for airspace viability
4. Secure option agreements: £50-75k for 18-24 months
5. Use £50k for Class MA assessment + planning studies
6. £75k contingency for structural surveys, negotiations
7. Expected ROI: 8-12x through hybrid PD/planning strategy

**Capital Breakdown:**
- £50-75k: Option fee (1-2 properties)
- £50k: Class MA + planning feasibility studies
- £75-100k: Structural surveys, legal, contingency
- **Total: £200k**

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence:**

1. **Filter 2 (Expired Planning)** ⭐ **HIGHEST PRIORITY**
   - Start with this because:
     - Highest profit potential (£2.5M-£4M)
     - Lowest planning risk (precedent established)
     - Most specific match to requirement
     - Smallest search (5-12 properties) = focused effort
   - Action: Identify all properties, research lapse reasons, approach top 3 vendors

2. **Filter 1 (Tall Building Zone Options)** - Then pursue this:
   - Second priority because:
     - Buildings already at target height (25-35m)
     - Policy support strong
     - Multiple distress signals
   - Action: Secure 1-2 option agreements in tall building zones, start planning

3. **Filter 3 (Airspace Options)** - Finally as diversification:
   - Third priority because:
     - More complex (two-stage process)
     - Lower certainty of reaching full 8 storeys
     - Good backup/diversification
   - Action: Identify 2-3 best candidates, secure options as backup strategy

---

## Geographic Refinements

**Suggested Priority Areas:**

### London (Primary Focus)
**Tall Building Policy Boroughs:**
- Tower Hamlets (Canary Wharf, Isle of Dogs Opportunity Area)
- Newham (Royal Docks, Stratford Opportunity Area)
- Greenwich (Greenwich Peninsula OA)
- Croydon (Opportunity Area, tall building zone)
- Lewisham (Catford, Lewisham town center)

**Why:** Explicit tall building policies, high PTAL, proven 8-storey precedents

### Regional Cities (Secondary)
**Manchester:**
- City center core
- Northern Quarter
- Corridor (Oxford Road)

**Birmingham:**
- HS2 corridor sites
- Digbeth regeneration area
- City center core

**Leeds:**
- South Bank

- Filter 2: £2.5M-£4M per deal (expired planning + vendor finance)
- Filter 3: £1.5M-£2.5M per deal (hybrid Class MA/planning strategy)

**Capital Deployment Strategy:**
- Filter 1: £75k + £75k + £50k (1-2 options)
- Filter 2: £100k + £50k + £50k (1 conditional contract)
- Filter 3: £50-75k + £50k + £75k (1-2 options)

**Portfolio Approach:**
- Recommended: 1x Filter 2 + 1x Filter 1 OR 2x Filter 3
- Diversifies risk across strategies
- Total investment: £200k across 2-3 properties

---

## Alternative Approaches

### If Results Are Too Narrow:

**Geographic Expansion:**
- Expand to all UK cities with tall building policies
- Include Scotland (Edinburgh, Glasgow city centers)
- Include Northern Ireland (Belfast waterfront)

**Height Adjustments:**
- Filter 1: Include 20-35m (captures more properties)
- Filter 3: Include 15-25m (broader but riskier)

**Time Windows:**
- Filter 2: Extend to 1-6 years (more expired planning)
- All filters: Reduce "sold >5 years" to ">3 years"

**PTAL Reduction:**
- Include PTAL 3 (good but not excellent transport)
- Expands to more areas outside London

**Policy Flexibility:**
- Filter 3: Increase proximity to 200m from tall building zones
- Filter 1: Include "emerging" tall building policy areas

### If Results Are Too Broad:

**Tighten Geography:**
- London only
- Specific boroughs with most active tall building approvals

**Increase Height Requirements:**
- Filter 1: 28-35m only (fully at scale)
- Filter 3: 20-25m only (closest to target)

**Strengthen Distress Signals:**
- Add: "Building on title is derelict"
- Add: "Price reduced >15%"
- Add: "Back on market after sale fell through"

**Financial Filters:**
- Add: Commercial sales average price < £X per sqm
- Add: Latest sold price < £X (cap absolute values)

**PTAL Restriction:**
- Only PTAL 5, 6a, 6b (best transport only)
- Ensures planning success at density

## Critical Success Factors

### Deal Structuring:
- Option agreements are NOT simple purchases - require legal expertise
- Conditional contracts need careful structuring (planning condition, time limits)
- Vendor finance requires trust and sophisticated negotiation
- JV partnerships essential for exit strategy on larger deals

### Planning Knowledge:
- Tall building policy interpretation varies by borough
- Pre-application advice CRITICAL before committing capital
- Housing Delivery Test results change annually - stay current
- Class MA regulations complex - need specialist advice

### Market Intelligence:
- Understanding WHY planning expired is crucial (not just THAT it expired)
- Vendor motivation research takes time but multiplies success rate
- Distressed assets require different approach than normal sales
- Institutional vs private owners have very different negotiation dynamics

### Network Requirements:
- Planning consultants with borough-specific experience
- Structural engineers for airspace feasibility
- Development finance brokers for execution phase
- Institutional JV partners for exit (funds, housebuilders)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Diversification:
- Don't put all £200k in one deal
- Spread across 2-3 opportunities using different filters
- Mix high-risk/high-reward (Filter 2) with lower-risk (Filter 3)

### Due Diligence:
- Planning history review (not just expired permission)
- Title checks (easements, restrictive covenants)
- Structural surveys before committing to airspace deals
- Local plan review (policy changes since expired planning)

### Legal Protection:
- Option agreements must include clear terms (exercise period, price formula)
- Conditional contracts need proper planning conditions
- Create SPV for each deal (limit personal liability)
- Engage property solicitor experienced in options/conditional contracts

### Execution Planning:
- Secure planning pre-app meetings BEFORE finalizing option terms
- Identify JV partners early (don't assume you'll find them later)
- Budget contingency for planning appeals if needed
- Have exit strategy beyond just "find a developer"

---

## Market Timing Considerations (2025)

**Favorable Factors:**
- More distressed commercial assets post-COVID/remote work
- Expired planning from 2020-2024 period (funding challenges)
- Councils under pressure from HDT failures
- Tall building policies becoming more widespread
- Institutional capital seeking pre-permitted sites

**Challenges:**
- Higher interest rates affect development viability
- Construction costs elevated
- Some boroughs pushing back on tall buildings
- Competition from institutional buyers with more capital

**Opportunities:**
- Vendor finance more available (sellers can't find buyers)
- Option agreements cheaper (less competition for non-purchase deals)
- Councils more pragmatic on density (HDT pressure)
- Mixed-use increasingly favored over pure residential
