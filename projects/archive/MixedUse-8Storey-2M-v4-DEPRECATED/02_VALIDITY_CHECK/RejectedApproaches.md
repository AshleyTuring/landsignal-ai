# Rejected Approaches & Learnings

**Project:** [PROJECT_NAME]
**Date:** [DATE]

---

## Purpose

Document approaches that failed technical validation and extract learnings for:
1. Updating `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` (if new issues discovered)
2. Avoiding similar mistakes in future projects
3. Understanding LLM blind spots

---

## Rejected Approaches

### Approach [X]: [Name]
**LLM:** [Gemini/Codex/Claude]
**Strategy:** [Brief description]

**Fatal Issues:**
1. ❌ [Issue 1 - e.g., Uses "Planning Status: Expired" filter which doesn't exist]
2. ❌ [Issue 2 - e.g., Uses sqm units for title area (only acres available)]
3. ❌ [Issue 3]

**Learning:**
[What does this teach us about SearchLand AI or LLM assumptions?]

**Action Taken:**
- [ ] Updated LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
- [ ] Pattern already documented
- [ ] Added to FILTER_PATTERNS.md anti-patterns

**Could Be Salvaged:**
[Yes/No - If yes, what modifications would make it valid?]

---

## Common Issues Across Approaches

**Issue Pattern:** [e.g., Multiple LLMs assumed sqm units exist]
**Frequency:** [X/Y approaches]
**Root Cause:** [Why did LLMs make this assumption?]
**Solution:** [How to prevent in future prompts?]

---

## Learnings Summary

**New discoveries for LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md:**
- [New learning 1]
- [New learning 2]

**Existing patterns reinforced:**
- [Existing pattern 1 that LLMs still violate]

**Prompt improvements needed:**
- [How to make future prompts clearer?]

---

**Next Step:** Proceed with VALID approaches to Stage 3: Parallel Testing
