# ITERATION TASK: Resolve Technical Disagreements

You previously critiqued filter approaches. However, there are DISAGREEMENTS among agents on technical validity.

## YOUR TASK
Review the critiques from all 3 agents and YOUR OWN critique. For approaches where there's disagreement:

### Identify Disagreements:
Look for approaches where agents disagree on PASS/FAIL:
- 2 agents say VALID, 1 says INVALID = disagreement
- 2 agents say INVALID, 1 says VALID = disagreement
- All 3 disagree = major disagreement

### Reconsider Your Position:
For each disagreement, ask yourself:
1. **Is this a technical error or a suggestion?**
   - Technical: "Filter doesn't exist" = error
   - Suggestion: "Could use better filter" = preference (ignore)

2. **Did I miss something the other agents caught?**
   - Check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md again
   - Verify units (acres vs sqm, etc.)
   - Check syntax validity

3. **Am I being too strict or too lenient?**
   - Too strict: Marking INVALID for minor suggestions
   - Too lenient: Missing actual technical errors

### Output Format:
For EACH approach where you disagreed with majority:

```
## Approach [X]: [Name]

**My Original Position:** VALID / INVALID
**Majority Position:** VALID / INVALID

**After Reconsideration:**
- [Specific point I reconsidered]
- [What I checked in available filters]
- [What other agents caught that I missed OR what I still disagree with]

**Updated Position:** VALID / INVALID / CONDITIONAL

**Rationale:** [Brief explanation]

**If Still Disagree:** [Explain technical reason why]
```

### Rules:
- Focus ONLY on technical correctness (filter existence, units, syntax)
- Ignore strategic preferences ("I like approach A better")
- If you were wrong, admit it and update position
- If you're still right, explain technical reason clearly

| Approach | Strategic Angle | Validation | Status |
|----------|----------------|------------|--------|
| 1. Urban Site Replication | Precedent | PASS | VALID |
| 2. London PTAL-Based | Precedent | PASS | VALID |
| 3. Motivated Commercial | Precedent | PASS | VALID |

## Critical Issues Requiring Revision

### Approach 6: Stalled Planning Option Play
**Issue:** Missing `Tenure: is equal to Freehold` filter - critical for option agreement strategy

**Revised Filters:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 3
2. Proposal: contains "storey"
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 10
4. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
5. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
8. Tenure: is equal to Freehold  ← ADDED
```

### Approach 10: Strategic Land Promotion
**Issue:** `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0` is CRITICAL - will return near-zero results

**Revised Filters:**
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
2. Developed area percentage: is less than 5
3. Distance to nearest adopted settlement boundary (m): is less than 500  ← CHANGED from 200m
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2  ← CHANGED from = 0
5. Ownership type: is one of Private owner
6. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
```

## Conditional Approaches - Minor Fixes Needed

### Approach 5: Airspace Development
**Add:** `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 1`

### Approach 9: Fresh Emerging Allocations
**Verify:** Exact enum values in SearchLand for "Site allocation type" and "Ownership type: Private owner"

---

## Recurring Minor Issue

All approaches 1-4, 6 use "Freehold tenure" shorthand. For clarity, ensure consistent syntax:
```
Tenure: is equal to Freehold
```

---

## Testing Priority Recommendation (Updated)

Based on technical validation:

1. **Approach 7** - Corporate Liquidation (VALID, strongest motivation)
2. **Approach 5** - Airspace Development (CONDITIONAL, add area filter)
3. **Approach 4** - Lease Expiry + EPC (VALID)
4. **Approach 3** - Motivated Commercial (VALID)
5. **Approach 6** - Stalled Planning (**REVISED** - add tenure)
6. **Approach 1** - Urban Site Replication (VALID)
7. **Approach 8** - Combined Motivation (VALID)
8. **Approach 2** - London PTAL (VALID, London-only)
9. **Approach 9** - Fresh Allocations (CONDITIONAL, verify enums)
10. **Approach 10** - Strategic Land (**REVISED** - fix applications filter)

# VALIDATION SUMMARY

## Overall Results

| Approach | Validation | Key Issue |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 1. Urban Site Replication | CONDITIONAL | Tenure syntax |
| 2. London PTAL-Based | CONDITIONAL | Tenure syntax |
| 3. Motivated Commercial | CONDITIONAL | Tenure syntax |
| 4. Lease Expiry + EPC | CONDITIONAL | Tenure syntax |
| 5. Airspace Development | CONDITIONAL | Tenure syntax |
| 6. Stalled Planning | CONDITIONAL | Missing tenure |
| 7. Corporate Liquidation | **VALID** | Minor (add tenure) |
| 8. Combined Motivation | **VALID** | Minor (add tenure) |
| 9. Emerging Allocations | CONDITIONAL | Enum values unverified |
| 10. Strategic Land | CONDITIONAL | Ownership type value |

## Critical Fixes Required

### Recurring Issue: "Freehold tenure" Syntax
**Affects:** Approaches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**Problem:** "Freehold tenure" is not valid filter syntax

**Fix:** Change to: `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`

### Enum Value Verification Needed
**Affects:** Approaches 9, 10

**Problem:** "Private owner" should likely be "Private individual"

**Fix:** Verify exact values in SearchLand dropdown before testing

### PTAL/Site Allocation Values
**Affects:** Approaches 2, 9

**Problem:** Need to confirm exact enum values accepted by SearchLand

**Fix:** Check dropdown options in SearchLand interface

## Ready to Test (After Fixes)

**Immediately ready:**
- Approach 7: Corporate Liquidation/Distress ✅
- Approach 8: Combined Motivation Signals ✅

**Ready after tenure syntax fix:**
- Approaches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**Ready after enum verification:**
- Approaches 9, 10

## Capital Feasibility Check

All approaches pass £200k capital test:
- Liquidation sales can be acquired <£200k distressed
- Option agreements £10k-£150k entry
- Airspace rights £50k-£150k
- Strategic options £5k-£50k

No capital feasibility issues identified.

## Key Fixes Required Before Testing

### Recurring Issue (Approaches 1-5):
**"Freehold tenure"** → Change to: `Tenure: is equal to Freehold`

### Approach 6 - Major Fix:
Add: `Tenure: is equal to Freehold` (filter 8)

### Approaches 9 & 10 - Verify:
Check exact "Ownership type" dropdown value - may be "Private" not "Private owner"

## Capital Feasibility Check (£200k)

All approaches pass capital feasibility:
- **Approaches 7, 3:** Direct purchase viable at distressed pricing
- **Approaches 5, 6:** Airspace rights/option agreements £50k-£150k
- **Approaches 4, 8:** Option agreements £10k-£50k
- **Approaches 9, 10:** Strategic options £5k-£50k + promotion costs

## Recommended Testing Priority

1. **Approach 7** - Corporate Liquidation (0 issues, strongest signal)
2. **Approach 5** - Airspace Development (1 minor fix)
3. **Approach 8** - Combined Motivation (0 issues)
4. **Approach 4** - Lease Expiry + EPC (1 minor fix)
5. **Approach 3** - Motivated Commercial (1 minor fix)

Then proceed with remaining approaches after initial testing validates filter behavior.
