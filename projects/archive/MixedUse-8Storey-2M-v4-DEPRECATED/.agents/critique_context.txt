# CRITIQUE TASK: Technical Validation of All Approaches

You are reviewing ALL approaches generated in the collaborative exploration phase.

## YOUR TASK
For EACH approach generated (typically 4-10 across 5 strategic angles), perform TECHNICAL VALIDATION ONLY:

### Validation Criteria:
1. **Filter Existence:** Do all filters exist in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md?
2. **Correct Units:** Are units correct (acres not sqm, sqft not sqm, metres)?
3. **Valid Syntax:** Is the syntax valid per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md?
4. **Logical Coherence:** Are there contradictions? (e.g., "Title area > 10 AND < 5")
5. **Capital Feasibility:** Can £200k realistically enable this strategy?

### DO NOT Judge:
- ❌ Which approach is "better"
- ❌ Which you "prefer"
- ❌ How many results it will get (only flag if obviously 0 or millions)

### Output Format:
For each approach, provide:

```
## Approach: [Approach Name from Collaborative Output]
(Strategic Angle: Precedent / Regulation / Structural / Behavioral / Challenge)

**Technical Validation:** PASS / FAIL

**Issues Found:**
1. [Issue description] - Severity: CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR
2. [Issue description] - Severity: CRITICAL / MAJOR / MINOR
...

**Suggested Fixes:**
- [How to fix issue 1]
- [How to fix issue 2]
...

**Overall Assessment:** VALID (proceed to testing) / INVALID (needs revision) / CONDITIONAL (fix minor issues first)
```

### Severity Definitions:
- **CRITICAL:** Approach will not work (wrong filters, impossible logic)
- **MAJOR:** Approach will work but with significant issues (wrong units, suboptimal filters)
- **MINOR:** Approach works but could be improved (optional enhancements)

Be HONEST and THOROUGH. The goal is to catch errors BEFORE testing in SearchLand.

# COLLABORATIVE STRATEGIC EXPLORATION

## Three Expert Property Analysts Working Together

---

## ROUND 1: PRECEDENT ANALYSIS 🎯 (MANDATORY)

### Collaborative Discussion

**Analyst A:** Looking at this 8-storey mixed-use approval, the key factors are clear:
- **Scale:** 8 storeys = 25-35m height (substantial for mixed-use)
- **Mix:** Class E ground floor + C3 residential above
- **Amenity provision:** Terraces, cycle parking, accessible parking
- This was approved in an urban location supporting densification

**Analyst B:** Agreed. The policy support is critical here. This only gets approved where:
- PTAL 4+ (London) OR excellent transport links (rest of UK)
- Area supports tall buildings (local plan policy)
- Zero flood zone 3 (essential for residential)
- Minimal conservation area overlap (height objections)

**Analyst C:** For filter implementation, I see two distinct approaches:
1. **Direct replication:** Find sites with similar characteristics (area, height capacity, transport)
2. **Planning precedent:** Find actual approvals for similar schemes and target adjacent/similar properties

Let's start with the core factors we agree on:

**Consensus Core Factors:**
- Title area: 0.2-2 acres (enough for 8-storey with parking/amenity)
- Current height: <15m (headroom for intensification)
- Transport: High accessibility required
- Constraints: No flood zone 3, minimal conservation

**Implementation Options Discussed:**

**Analyst A:** For transport, PTAL 4+ works for London but excludes 90% of UK. We should create both variants.

**Analyst B:** I'd also propose targeting existing commercial (Class E) since ground floor needs retail anyway. Easier to get permission for mixed-use if commercial already established.

**Analyst C:** Good point. And for the £200k capital constraint, we need motivation signals. Long-hold corporate ownership on existing low-rise commercial would be ideal.

### PRECEDENT APPROACHES:

```
PRECEDENT APPROACHES: 3 approaches

Approach 1: Urban Site Replication (Consensus)
Filters:
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.198 AND less than 2.47
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
4. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
5. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is less than 20
6. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)
7. Freehold tenure

Rationale: Replicates the core characteristics of the approved scheme - right size, height capacity, transport access, minimal constraints, existing commercial use. Sites meeting these criteria have similar approvals precedent.

Expected results: 20-50 properties per geography (UK-wide urban areas)


Approach 2: London PTAL-Based (Proposed by: Analyst A)
Filters:
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.198 AND less than 2.47
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
4. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Freehold tenure

Rationale: Uses official PTAL metric (London-only) which provides policy support for density. Adds "inactive" filter for motivation signal (stalled development opportunity).

Expected results: 10-30 properties in London


Approach 3: Motivated Commercial with Height Capacity (Proposed by: Analyst B & C)
Filters:
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.198 AND less than 2.47
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
4. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)
5. Ownership type: is equal to Company
6. Latest sold date: is before 2019-01-01
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
8. Freehold tenure

Rationale: Targets corporate-owned commercial properties held 5+ years (motivation signal) with current low-rise that can intensify to 8+ storeys. Corporate sellers more likely to negotiate options at £200k entry.

Expected results: 15-40 properties per geography
```

---

## ROUND 2: REGULATION/POLICY ANGLE 📋

### Collaborative Discussion

**Analyst A:** For regulatory pressure, the strongest signals are:
- HMO expired licenses (cannot operate legally)
- Lease expiry (income cliff within 6-12 months)
- EPC E-G (cannot let)

But none of these directly apply to 8-storey mixed-use development...

**Analyst B:** Actually, lease expiry on existing commercial properties IS relevant. If a ground floor retail/office has a lease expiring, the owner faces:
- Find new tenant (effort/cost)
- Sell the freehold (motivated)
- Redevelop (our angle!)

The motivation creates opportunity for option agreements at £200k entry.

**Analyst C:** Strong point. And low EPC on commercial buildings also works - owner can't legally let to new tenants without improvements. Combined with lease expiry = double motivation.

**Consensus:** One strong regulation approach - Lease Expiry + EPC Compliance pressure on commercial sites.

---

### REGULATION APPROACHES:

```
REGULATION APPROACHES: 1 approach

Approach 4: Commercial Lease Expiry + EPC Pressure (Consensus)
Filters:
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.198 AND less than 2.47
2. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c), E(g)
3. Lease end date: is between 2025-06-01 AND 2026-12-31
4. EPC rating: is one of D, E, F, G
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
7. Freehold tenure

Rationale: Expiring leases (6-18 months) create income cliff. Low EPC means owner cannot easily re-let without £5k-£50k improvement spend. Combined pressure creates strong motivation for sale/redevelopment. Perfect for option agreement approach at £200k.

Expected results: 10-25 properties per geography
```

---

## ROUND 3: STRUCTURAL/CREATIVE ANGLE 🏗️

### Collaborative Discussion

**Analyst A:** The £200k capital constraint is key here. We need structural plays:
- Airspace rights on existing buildings (flat roofs)
- Option agreements on larger sites
- Stalled planning (work already done)

**Analyst B:** Airspace is perfect for 8-storey targets. Find a 3-4 storey building with flat roof and add 4-5 storeys residential above. Purchase airspace rights £50k-£150k.

**Analyst C:** For option agreements, target larger sites with old planning approvals that stalled. The owner invested in planning but didn't build - they may accept option payment (£10k-£50k) for someone else to take it forward.

**Group Decision:** Two strong structural approaches - Airspace Development and Stalled Planning Option Play.

---

### STRUCTURAL APPROACHES:

```
STRUCTURAL APPROACHES: 2 approaches

Approach 5: Airspace Development on Commercial (Consensus)
Filters:
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Max number of building floors on title: is less than 5
4. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c), E(g)
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
7. Freehold tenure

Rationale: Flat roof commercial buildings 3-4 storeys can add 4-5 residential storeys above. Airspace purchase £50k-£150k within £200k capital. Existing utilities/access. Height capacity to reach 8-storey total.

Capital model: £50k-£150k airspace rights + bank finance for build
Expected results: 20-40 properties per geography


Approach 6: Stalled Planning Option Play (Proposed by: Analyst C)
Filters:
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 3
2. Proposal: contains "storey"
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 10
4. Last application submitted: is before 2022-01-01
5. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0

Rationale: Sites with planning applications for multi-storey schemes (10+ units) submitted 3+ years ago that are now inactive. Owner invested £50k-£100k in planning but stalled. Strong motivation to accept option payment (£10k-£50k) rather than lose everything.

Capital model: £10k-£50k option agreement + planning revival costs
Expected results: 10-20 properties per geography
```

---

## ROUND 4: BEHAVIORAL/MOTIVATION ANGLE 🧠

### Collaborative Discussion

**Analyst A:** For seller motivation, the strongest signals are:
- Corporate liquidation (FORCED sale)
- Long hold + derelict (write-off opportunity)
- Company status: Administration

**Analyst B:** Liquidation is extremely strong but rare. We should also look at long corporate holds on underperforming assets - 7+ years with derelict/inactive status suggests non-core holding they'd exit cheaply.

**Analyst C:** Also consider combining multiple weaker signals: Long hold + no recent planning + inactive building = tired owner who'd accept option agreement.

**Group Decision:** Two behavioral approaches - Liquidation/Distress (strongest signal) and Combined Motivation Signals (broader pool).

---

### BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES:

```
BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES: 2 approaches

Approach 7: Corporate Liquidation/Distress (Consensus - Strongest)
Filters:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 3
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0

Rationale: Liquidation = forced sale. Liquidators must sell assets, motivated to complete quickly, often accept below-market offers. Cash buyers with fast completion preferred. Extremely strong motivation for £200k acquisition or option.

Expected results: 5-15 properties per geography (rare but high-value)


Approach 8: Combined Motivation Signals (Proposed by: Analyst B & C)
Filters:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Latest sold date: is before 2017-01-01
3. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.198 AND less than 2.5
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0

Rationale: Multiple weak signals compound to strong motivation: 7+ year corporate hold (non-core) + inactive building (write-off candidate) + no planning activity (stale). Owner likely tired and receptive to option agreement at £200k entry.

Expected results: 10-25 properties per geography
```

## ROUND 5: CHALLENGE ROUND 🚀

### Purpose: Force exploration beyond obvious angles

### Collaborative Discussion

**Analyst A:** Something different... Time arbitrage? Monitor emerging allocations in local plans - contact owners SAME DAY allocation announced, before they know value.

**Analyst B:** Or contrarian: target sites where recent planning was REFUSED for height, but policy has since changed (new local plan, Levelling Up Act, etc.).

**Analyst C:** Speculative idea: Strategic land at edge of emerging settlements. No planning yet, not even SHLAA assessed. Promote site to local authority, get allocation, then sell option to developer.

**Group Decision:** Two challenge approaches - Time Arbitrage on Fresh Allocations and Strategic Land Promotion (both longer timeline, higher risk/reward).

---

### CHALLENGE APPROACHES:

```
CHALLENGE APPROACHES: 2 approaches

Approach 9: Time Arbitrage - Fresh Emerging Allocations (Proposed by: Analyst A)
Filters:
1. Site allocation type: is one of Housing allocation (emerging), Mixed allocation (emerging)
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
4. Ownership type: is one of Company, Private owner
5. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0

Rationale: Sites newly allocated in emerging local plans where owner hasn't yet applied for planning. Contact owner immediately after allocation announced - they don't know market value yet. Secure option at "pre-allocation" price (£50k-£100k), sell at "post-planning" value (10x).

Note: This is time-sensitive and speculative - requires monitoring emerging local plans
Expected results: 5-15 properties per geography (but high value if executed quickly)


Approach 10: Strategic Land Promotion - Un-Assessed Edge Sites (Proposed by: Analyst C)
Filters:
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
2. Developed area percentage: is less than 5
3. Distance to nearest adopted settlement boundary (m): is less than 200
4. Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0
5. Ownership type: is one of Private owner
6. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is equal to 0
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75

Rationale: Undeveloped land within 200m of settlement boundary with no planning history. Promote to local authority for allocation in next local plan. Secure option (£5k-£30k), invest in planning promotion (£20k-£50k), sell to developer when allocated (£500k-£2M).

Note: Long timeline (2-5 years), requires planning expertise, but massive ROI potential
Expected results: 10-30 properties per geography
```

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

Example:
1. [Exact filter usage]

Performance/Notes:
- [Any observations]
```
Related: [Link to FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable]
```

### Recent Contributions:
