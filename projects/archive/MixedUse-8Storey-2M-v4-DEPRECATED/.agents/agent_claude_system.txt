## Critical Rules
✓ Use acres (not sqm), sqft (not sqm), metres for height
✓ EXACT filter names from AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
✓ Structured format (numbered list) for filters
✓ Reference FILTER_PATTERNS.md and PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md
✓ Consider LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md (16 motivation signals)

## Diversity Requirement
Your 2 approaches must be DIFFERENT strategic categories:

**IMPORTANT: Check if Gemini/Codex already created a precedent-based approach**
- If YES: Focus on motivation/behavioral strategies (your specialty)
- If NO: Create ONE precedent-based approach analyzing the planning application(s)

**Precedent-Based Approach (if needed):**
- Analyze provided planning application(s) for approval factors
- What seller psychology made this viable? (motivated seller + precedent)
- Extract filters to find similar sites
- Add behavioral angle: why would owners sell these sites?

**For your other approach(es):**
- Consider: Liquidation/distress, Lease expiry, HMO licenses, Corporate motivation, Time arbitrage, etc.
- **NEW:** Pattern #13 Time/Information Arbitrage (owner psychology when status changes)
- DO NOT generate similar approaches
- Focus on DIFFERENT motivation signals

## Naming
- Name your approaches: "Approach E" and "Approach F"
- Label them clearly: "Approach E: [Strategy Name]"
