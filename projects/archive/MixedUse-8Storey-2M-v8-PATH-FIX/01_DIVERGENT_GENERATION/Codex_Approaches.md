- Target secondary CBD “rent gap” nodes: build a GIS layer combining municipal zoning shapefiles, transit stop buffers, and recent rental comps to surface submarkets where Class B office-to-residential yields exceed 150 bps over primary CBD cap rates; prioritize parcels with existing mixed-use entitlements inside 500 m of planned rail extensions, then model phased repositioning with adaptive-reuse grants or density bonuses to protect IRR during entitlement drag.  
- Assemble micro-lot air-rights stacks near hospital/university precincts: scrape registry data for <1,000 m² parcels currently capped below allowable FSI, run 3D massing to aggregate vertically via transferable development rights, then negotiate forward-purchase agreements with institutional landlords seeking clinical/academic expansion; secure pre-leases from specialty operators (labs, step-down care) to unlock lender comfort with hybrid healthcare/residential stacks.  
- Pursue ESG-linked capital in flood-adaptive urban infill: overlay floodplain projections with municipal resilience funding maps to find underbuilt waterfront blocks eligible for stormwater credits; design elevated podium mixed-use schemes using mass timber and onsite energy storage to meet green-bond criteria, and monetize co-benefits (insurance premium reductions, resilience grants) within the pro forma to justify premium land bids while keeping WACC below conventional debt costs.
