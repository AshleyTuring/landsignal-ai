## Approach A: Fresh Consent Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 13A: Fresh planning consents (24h advantage)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£100k for option agreements and due diligence  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Planning applications in last 30 days: is greater than 0
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
3. Building height (metres): is less than 15
4. Distance to train station (metres): is less than 800
5. Flood risk zone: is not 3
6. Local plan designation: contains "tall building zone" OR "opportunity area" OR "HDT"
```

**Rationale:**
This leverages Pattern 13A for time arbitrage, targeting newly approved consents within 30 days to capitalize on 24-hour market advantages before wider awareness. Matches precedent characteristics for 8-storey mixed-use with airspace potential, enabling quick £200k capital deployment via options for £2M profit through densification.

**Strengths:**
- Speed advantage in identifying fresh approvals before competition
- Low capital entry via options (£10k-£50k each)
- High ROI potential from immediate development rights
- Urban transport access supports density
- Precedent-based with minimal constraints

**Limitations:**
- Narrow time window requires daily monitoring
- Limited to recent approvals (30-day filter)
- Dependent on quick due diligence execution
- May exclude older stalled applications
- Geographic concentration in active planning areas

**Implementation Strategy:**
Monitor daily for new consents; secure options within 24 hours; conduct rapid title/transport checks; structure joint ventures for airspace rights; aim for 12-month planning completion.

## Approach B: Airspace Rights Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Airspace development (flat roofs, £50k-£150k rights)  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£150k for airspace acquisition and planning fees  
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Building height (metres): is greater than 20 AND less than 35
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
3. Current use class: contains "E" OR "B1" OR "commercial"
4. Distance to train station (metres): is less than 1000
5. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 3
6. Flood risk zone: is not 3
```

**Rationale:**
Exploits Pattern 6A for innovative airspace arbitrage on existing buildings with height potential, avoiding full site acquisition. Targets mixed-use precedents with flat roofs suitable for 8-storey additions, using £200k for rights purchases to achieve £2M profit through vertical expansion in urban areas.

**Strengths:**
- Innovative arbitrage without full ownership
- Lower capital intensity (£50k-£150k per site)
- Exploits underutilized airspace in dense areas
- Transport proximity enables high-density schemes
- Bypasses ground-level constraints

**Limitations:**
- Requires existing building ownership cooperation
- Height restrictions may limit to 25-35m additions
- Planning complexity for airspace rights
- Dependent on roof access and structural viability
- Fewer results in rural or low-density areas

**Implementation Strategy:**
Identify flat-roof buildings via aerial mapping; negotiate airspace leases; commission structural surveys; submit planning for mixed-use additions; partner with developers for construction.

## Approach C: Stalled Planning Revival

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A: Stalled planning (expired but resubmittable)  
**Capital Required:** £20k-£50k for option agreements and planning consultants  
**Expected Results:** 25-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Planning applications in last 5 years: is greater than 0 AND less than 3
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.5
3. Building height (metres): is less than 15
4. Distance to train station (metres): is less than 800
5. Current use class: contains "E" OR "commercial" OR "retail"
6. Local plan designation: contains "opportunity area" OR "tall building zone"
```

**Rationale:**
Applies Pattern 1A for timing arbitrage on expired but resubmittable consents, reviving 8-storey mixed-use precedents. Uses £200k for options and expert advice to restart stalled applications, targeting motivated sellers with low activity for £2M profit in 12-24 months.

**Strengths:**
- Arbitrage opportunity in overlooked expired consents
- Low upfront capital (£10k-£50k options)
- Precedent-based with existing planning history
- Urban transport links support density
- Targets inactive sites with seller motivation

**Limitations:**
- Resubmission success not guaranteed
- Requires planning expertise for revival
- May face updated policy changes
- Dependent on original application quality
- Narrow to sites with recent but limited activity

**Implementation Strategy:**
Filter for sites with 1-2 applications in 5 years; review expired consents for resubmittability; secure options; engage planning consultants; update applications for current policies; negotiate joint ventures for development.
