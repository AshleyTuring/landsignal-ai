# Independent Filter Generation - MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v7

**Analyst Perspective:** Risk mitigation, precedent analysis, behavioral signals (Claude approach)  
**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Context:** £2M profit target, £200k capital, 8-storey mixed-use precedent

---

## Approach A: Regulation-Driven Liquidation + Precedent Adjacency

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation Sales) + Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreement or distressed acquisition)  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted)

### SearchLand AI Prompt:

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.5
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(g)(i), Sui Generis
6. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
7. NOT: Flood zone 3, Conservation area
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

### Rationale:

This approach combines **forced-sale motivation** with **development-ready characteristics**:

- **Liquidation/Administration = FORCED SALE:** Legally obligated to dispose of assets, creates exceptional negotiating leverage
- **0.2-2.5 acres (8,000-100,000 sqft):** Adequate for 8-storey mixed-use with parking/amenity (matches precedent)
- **Height <15m:** Existing low-rise allows for **25-35m upward development** (8-storey target)
- **<1km train station:** Supports density policy (PTAL proxy for non-London areas)
- **E/Sui Generis use:** Commercial base suitable for mixed-use conversion
- **70%+ unconstrained:** Developable plot with minimal planning impediments

**Precedent Application:** Sites matching these characteristics in areas with approved 8-storey schemes will have strong planning precedent.

### Strengths:

- **Exceptional motivation:** Forced sale = maximum negotiating power, below-market pricing
- **Clear decision-maker:** Liquidator/administrator (fast decisions vs. private owners)
- **Low capital entry:** Distressed pricing often 20-40% below market
- **Option structure viable:** £10k-£50k secures site while seeking planning
- **Precedent-backed:** Transport + adequate size + low-rise existing = planning rationale

### Limitations:

- **Very limited pool:** Liquidations rare (5-15 results likely)
- **Competition from specialists:** Distressed asset buyers active
- **Complex legal:** Creditors, charges, title issues possible
- **Condition risk:** Derelict/inactive buildings common (structural unknowns)
- **Time pressure:** Liquidator timelines may be aggressive

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Identification & Due Diligence (Weeks 1-4)**
1. Run SearchLand filter across target geographies (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester)
2. Cross-reference with Companies House for liquidation date and administrator contact
3. Land Registry title check (charges, restrictions, easements)
4. Identify nearby approved 8-storey schemes (precedent research)

**Phase 2: Approach & Negotiation (Weeks 4-8)**
1. Contact administrator directly (not through agent if possible)
2. Offer: £50k-£150k cash OR £10k-£50k option with planning-contingent exercise
3. Emphasize: Speed, certainty, no chain (liquidator's priorities)
4. Request: 60-90 day exclusivity for planning assessment

**Phase 3: Planning Strategy (Months 2-12)**
1. Pre-app with LPA: 8-storey mixed-use (E ground floor + C3 above)
2. Cite precedent: Approved scheme's decision notice
3. Transport statement: <1km station = sustainable location
4. Viability assessment: Demonstrate community benefit (affordable housing %)
5. Submit full application

**Phase 4: Exit (Months 12-18)**
- **Option 1:** Sell with planning consent to housebuilder (£500k-£2M+ profit depending on location/scheme)
- **Option 2:** Joint venture with developer (retain 20-40% equity for £2M+ exit post-build)
- **Option 3:** Sell planning-contingent (lower risk, 50-70% of consented value)

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Site option/acquisition:** £50k-£150k
- **Planning consultant:** £30k-£50k
- **Technical surveys:** £10k-£20k (topographical, structural, contamination)
- **Legal:** £10k-£15k
- **Contingency:** £5k-£15k
- **Total:** £105k-£250k (stretches budget but highest ROI potential)

## Approach B: Strategic Land Promotion (Edge of Settlement) + Time Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 13A (Fresh Allocation Alert) + Pattern 11 (Strategic Land)  
**Capital Required:** £10k-£50k (option agreement)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (medium targeting)

### SearchLand AI Prompt:

```
1. Freehold tenure
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
3. No latest sold date
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
5. Private owner ownership
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
7. Less than 5% area developed
```

**THEN manually filter for:**
- Within 200m of adopted OR emerging settlement boundary
- Local authority has failed Housing Delivery Test OR has tall building policy
- NOT: SHLAA negative assessment

### Rationale:

This approach targets **"hidden gem" legacy holdings** at settlement edges with **emerging development pressure**:

- **No latest sold date = INHERITED/LEGACY:** Owner likely elderly, non-professional, unaware of development value
- **<1 application in 5 years:** Passive holding (no active development intent)
- **Private owner:** Easier negotiation than corporate (relationship-based)
- **0.5-5 acres:** Scale suitable for 8-storey scheme (20-80 units)
- **Edge of settlement:** Natural expansion direction for local plans
- **80%+ unconstrained:** Developable once allocated

**Time Arbitrage:** Monitor SearchLand daily for sites newly added to emerging allocations, contact owner immediately before agents/developers discover.

### Strengths:

- **Minimal capital:** £10k-£50k option secures control for 18-24 months
- **Information asymmetry:** Owner doesn't know site value (pre-allocation pricing)
- **Emerging policy support:** HDT failure = pressure to allocate more sites
- **10x ROI possible:** Buy option £50k, sell with allocation/planning £500k-£2M+
- **Patient capital:** Long timeline but very high returns

### Limitations:

- **Long timescale:** 24-48 months to allocation → planning → exit
- **Allocation not guaranteed:** Local plan process uncertain
- **Planning expertise required:** Promotion, pre-apps, local plan representations
- **Manual screening:** Cannot fully automate edge-of-settlement + HDT failure filters
- **Owner relationship:** May take 6-12 months to build trust with elderly landowner

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Site Identification (Months 1-2)**
1. Run SearchLand filter + manual screening for edge locations
2. Research local plans: Which authorities failed HDT? Emerging allocations?
3. Map settlement boundaries: Identify 50-200m edge sites
4. Title Registry: Confirm owner name, contact details

**Phase 2: Relationship Building (Months 2-6)**
1. Approach owner: "I'm interested in your land at [address], are you considering selling?"
2. Do NOT mention development value initially (information arbitrage)
3. Build rapport: Multiple meetings, understand their situation (estate planning? downsizing?)
4. Educate gradually: "The council is reviewing settlement boundaries, your land may be considered..."

**Phase 3: Option Agreement (Month 6)**
1. Offer: £10k-£50k for 24-month option with 12-month extension clause
2. Exercise price: £200k-£500k (still below post-allocation value)
3. Terms: Planning-contingent, you handle all costs/risk
4. Legal: £5k-£10k for option deed

**Phase 4: Promotion (Months 6-24)**
1. Engage planning consultant (£30k-£50k)
2. Submit representations to local plan consultation
3. Demonstrate: Sustainable location, natural infill, meets HDT targets
4. Pre-app for 8-storey mixed-use (test authority appetite)
5. Cite precedent: Similar schemes approved in area

**Phase 5: Exit (Months 24-36)**
- **Allocated in plan:** Sell to housebuilder £500k-£1M (profit £450k-£950k)
- **Planning consent granted:** Sell £1M-£3M+ depending on scheme (profit £2M+ possible)
- **Neither:** Option lapses (lose £10k-£50k + £30k-£50k consultancy)

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Option fee:** £10k-£50k
- **Planning consultant:** £30k-£50k
- **Legal:** £10k-£15k
- **Surveys/technical:** £10k-£20k
- **Monitoring/admin:** £5k-£10k
- **Total:** £65k-£145k (within budget, high risk/reward)

## Approach C: HMO License Expiry + Airspace Development

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 8A (HMO Expiry) + Pattern 6A (Airspace Development)  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£200k (acquisition + airspace rights)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (moderate targeting)

### SearchLand AI Prompt:

```
1. Freehold tenure
2. Currently has HMO: Yes
3. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-20
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 6 AND less than 12
5. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Use class: is one of C4, Sui Generis
9. NOT: Article 4 directions, Conservation area
```

### Rationale:

This approach combines **regulatory pressure** (expired HMO license = cannot operate) with **physical upside** (airspace potential):

- **Expired HMO license = FORCED ACTION:** Cannot rent until renewed (£1k-£3k + compliance costs) OR sell
- **6-12m height + flat roof:** Existing 2-3 storey building with 4-6 storey addition potential
- **0.05-0.3 acres (2,000-13,000 sqft):** Adequate footprint for 8-storey after extension
- **<800m train:** Supports density (planning rationale for height)
- **NOT Article 4:** Can renew HMO OR convert (flexibility)
- **Freehold:** No head lease complications

**Airspace Play:** Buy distressed HMO below market, add 5-6 storeys (total 8), convert to mixed-use (commercial ground + C3 flats above).

### Strengths:

- **Strong motivation:** Cannot operate legally + renewal costs = selling pressure
- **Dual upside:** Regulatory relief + airspace development (stacked profit)
- **Proven building:** Existing structure confirmed (less ground risk)
- **Transport-backed planning:** <800m station = density policy support
- **Medium competition:** HMO investors compete but airspace angle differentiates

### Limitations:

- **Structural unknown:** Can existing building support 5-6 additional storeys? (£10k-£20k survey)
- **Freeholder negotiation:** If leasehold HMO, need freeholder consent (adds complexity)
- **Party wall:** Neighboring properties may object (Party Wall Act procedures)
- **Planning risk:** Airspace not guaranteed (need pre-app confirmation)
- **Article 4 exclusion:** Reduces pool (but protects from competition)

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Identification & Screening (Weeks 1-4)**
1. Run SearchLand filter (expect 15-40 results per geography)
2. Desktop screening: Google Street View (flat roof confirmation, context)
3. Planning history: Any airspace refusals nearby? Height policies?
4. Structural desktop: Age of building (pre-1970 = may need retrofit)

**Phase 2: Acquisition (Months 1-3)**
1. Approach owner: "I see your HMO license expired. Are you considering selling?"
2. Offer: £100k-£200k (below market due to non-compliance + deferred maintenance)
3. Emphasize: Cash, fast completion, no chain, solve their problem
4. Due diligence: Full structural survey (can it support 5-6 storeys?)

**Phase 3: Planning Strategy (Months 3-12)**
1. Pre-app: 5-6 storey addition (total 8 storeys), mixed-use
2. Structural engineer: Steel frame extension design (£20k-£40k)
3. Transport statement: <800m station = sustainable
4. Precedent: Any nearby airspace approvals?
5. Full application: 8-storey mixed-use (E ground + 10-20 C3 flats)

**Phase 4: Exit (Months 12-24)**
- **Planning granted:** Sell to developer £400k-£800k (profit £200k-£600k depending on location)
- **Or JV:** Retain 30-50% equity, developer builds, exit post-sale £1M-£3M+ total
- **Fallback:** Renew HMO license (£3k), rent as HMO (5-8% yield) while waiting on planning

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Acquisition:** £100k-£200k
- **Structural survey:** £10k-£20k
- **Planning consultant:** £20k-£40k
- **Architect/engineer:** £20k-£40k
- **Legal:** £10k-£15k
- **Contingency:** £10k-£20k
- **Total:** £170k-£335k (exceeds budget but can phase: £110k acquisition + £20k surveys, pause if negative)

## Summary & Recommendation

| Approach | Capital | Expected Results | Timeline | Risk | ROI Potential |
|----------|---------|------------------|----------|------|---------------|
| **A: Liquidation + Precedent** | £105k-£250k | 5-15 | 12-18m | Medium | £500k-£2M+ |
| **B: Strategic Land + Time** | £65k-£145k | 10-30 | 24-48m | High | £450k-£2M+ |
| **C: HMO Expiry + Airspace** | £170k-£335k | 15-40 | 12-24m | Medium-High | £200k-£1M+ |

**Best Fit for £200k Budget:**
- **Approach B (Strategic Land):** Lowest capital (£65k-£145k), highest ROI potential (10x), but longest timeline
- **Approach A (Liquidation):** Medium capital (£105k-£250k), fast timeline, exceptional motivation signals

**Diversification Strategy:**
Run **Approach A + B in parallel** to balance fast opportunities (liquidations) with patient capital (strategic land). Both fit within £200k deployed capital if Approach A secures option (£50k) rather than full acquisition.

---

**Precedent Analysis Note:** All three approaches incorporate the 8-storey mixed-use precedent by:
1. **Height differential:** Targeting <12-15m existing buildings with 25-35m potential (8-storey target)
2. **Transport proximity:** <800-1,000m train station (density policy support)
3. **Adequate size:** 0.2-2.5 acres (matches precedent's likely footprint)
4. **Use class mix:** E commercial + C3 residential (precedent structure)
5. **Constrained areas avoided:** Flood zone 3, conservation areas excluded

This ensures each approach has strong planning precedent argumentation when submitting applications.
