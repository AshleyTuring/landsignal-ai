## Approach A: Urban Precedent Matching

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A: Similar planning approvals  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreements for planning-contingent deals)  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
6. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with recent planning approvals for tall mixed-use developments (8+ storeys) in urban areas with good transport access, matching the approved Slough/Birmingham/Manchester precedent. By focusing on successful precedents, we identify sites where similar schemes have been approved, reducing planning risk while leveraging the £200k capital for option agreements rather than direct purchase.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching reduces planning uncertainty
- Urban transport proximity supports density and value
- Recent approvals indicate active policy support for tall buildings
- Option agreements fit within £200k budget

**Limitations:**
- Limited to areas with recent tall building approvals
- May exclude sites without explicit "storey" keywords in proposals
- Transport filters exclude some viable urban sites

**Implementation Strategy:**
Secure option agreements (£10k-£50k each) on 5-10 identified sites. Engage planning consultants to confirm precedent applicability. Pursue planning applications for 8-storey mixed-use, targeting residential above ground-floor commercial. Exit via sale to housebuilder or developer at planning stage, aiming for £2M+ profit per successful conversion.

## Approach B: Airspace Intensification Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£200k (airspace rights £50k-£150k + planning costs)  
**Expected Results:** 30-60 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. Ownership type: is equal to Company
```

**Rationale:**
Focusing on existing commercial buildings with flat roofs and height capacity in urban areas, this approach enables adding 4-6 storeys of residential above to create 8-storey mixed-use. The £200k capital targets airspace rights purchases from corporate owners, avoiding full site acquisition while delivering substantial value uplift through intensification.

**Strengths:**
- Existing infrastructure reduces development costs
- Corporate ownership often motivated for airspace sales
- Transport proximity supports residential viability
- Lower capital entry than full redevelopment

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural assessments (additional £5k-£15k cost)
- Freeholder negotiation can be complex
- Limited to buildings with sufficient height headroom

**Implementation Strategy:**
Identify corporate-owned commercial buildings with flat roofs. Negotiate airspace rights (£50k-£150k) for adding residential storeys. Conduct structural surveys and apply for planning permission. Develop incrementally or sell rights to larger developers, targeting £2M profit through value creation from unused airspace.

## Approach C: Regulation-Driven Legacy Holdings

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 8A: HMO License Expiry + Pattern 14A: Inherited & Untouched Properties  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option agreements + license renewal costs)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-20
3. No latest sold date: is equal to Yes
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. NOT: Article 4 directions
```

**Rationale:**
Combining expired HMO licenses (forcing owner action) with legacy holdings (never sold, potentially inherited), this approach targets undervalued urban sites where owners face regulatory pressure. The £200k capital funds option agreements and license renewals, enabling conversion to 8-storey mixed-use while capitalizing on motivated sellers unaware of development potential.

**Strengths:**
- Strong dual motivation signals (regulation + legacy ownership)
- Urban transport access supports mixed-use viability
- Option agreements keep capital low
- Avoids Article 4 restrictions for easier conversion

**Limitations:**
- Limited to sites with existing HMOs
- Legacy owners may be difficult to contact
- License renewal costs add to budget

**Implementation Strategy:**
Target expired HMO sites owned by legacy holders. Secure options (£10k-£50k) and renew licenses if needed (£1k-£3k). Apply for planning to convert/add storeys for 8-storey mixed-use. Market to institutional buyers or develop directly, aiming for £2M profit through regulatory arbitrage and value unlocking.
