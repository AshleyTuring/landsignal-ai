## Summary & Recommendations

I've generated **3 unique property search strategies** using different analytical approaches:

### Approach Comparison Matrix:

| Criterion | **A: Precedent Match** | **B: Airspace/Intensification** | **C: Liquidation/Derelict** |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Strategic Pattern** | Stalled Planning + Similar Approvals | Airspace + Low-Rise in High-Density | Forced Sale + Derelict Turnaround |
| **Capital Required** | £60k-£150k | £100k-£200k | £100k-£200k |
| **Expected Results** | 20-50 properties | 10-30 properties | 5-15 properties |
| **Motivation Level** | Medium (frustration) | Medium-Low (commercial) | VERY HIGH (forced sale) |
| **Planning Risk** | Low (precedent exists) | Medium (new proposal) | Medium-High (virgin site) |
| **Timeline** | 12-18 months | 12-18 months | 12-18 months |
| **ROI Potential** | 15-30x | 10-20x | 15-25x |
| **Execution Complexity** | Medium | High (structural unknowns) | Medium (legal complexity) |

### Recommended Testing Priority:

1. **Start with Approach C (Liquidation):** Highest motivation, fastest negotiations, clearest pricing
2. **Parallel test Approach A (Precedent):** Lowest planning risk, proven concept
3. **Selective test Approach B (Airspace):** Higher complexity but unique angle (less competition)

### Key Differentiators:

**Approach A** = **Planning confidence** (precedent-based, stalled schemes with established principle)  
**Approach B** = **Capital efficiency** (airspace rights vs. freehold purchase, structural creativity)  
**Approach C** = **Deal certainty** (forced sellers, distressed pricing, speed advantage)

All three approaches achieve the £2M profit target with £200k capital through creative structuring (options, airspace, distressed pricing) rather than direct freehold purchase.
