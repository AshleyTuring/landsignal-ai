# Summary & Recommendations

I've generated **3 distinct approaches** using different strategic patterns:

| Approach | Pattern | Capital | Timeline | Risk | Expected Profit | Best For |
|----------|---------|---------|----------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **A: Direct Precedent** | Similar Approvals | £30k-£85k (options) | 12-24m | Medium | £750k-£1.85M per site | Planning expertise, patient capital |
| **B: Forced Sale** | Liquidation + Regulation | £133k-£205k (purchase) | 6-18m | Low-Medium | £800k-£1.65M per site | Opportunistic buyers, fast execution |
| **C: Airspace Rights** | Structural Arbitrage | £100k-£245k (rights) | 12-24m | Medium-High | £250k-£2.8M per site | Technical skills, creative structures |

## Key Differentiators:

**Approach A** = **SAFEST** (planning precedent reduces risk)  
**Approach B** = **FASTEST** (forced sales = 6-12 months to first exit)  
**Approach C** = **HIGHEST UPSIDE** (airspace arbitrage = £2M+ single site potential)

## My Recommendation for £2M Target:

**Execute Approach B (Forced Sale) + Approach C (Airspace) in parallel:**

1. **Month 1-3:** Run both filters, identify 2-3 liquidation targets + 2-3 airspace opportunities
2. **Month 3-6:** Acquire 1 liquidation site (£150k), secure 1 airspace option (£50k)
3. **Month 6-12:** Flip liquidation site with planning desktop (£750k-£1M profit)
4. **Month 12-24:** Exit airspace consent (£1M-£1.5M profit)
5. **Total: £1.75M-£2.5M combined profit**

This diversifies risk (motivation-driven + structural arbitrage) while staying within £200k capital.
