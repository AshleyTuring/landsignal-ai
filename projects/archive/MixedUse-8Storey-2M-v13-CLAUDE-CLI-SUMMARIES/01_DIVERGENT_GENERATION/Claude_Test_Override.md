## Summary & Recommendations

I've generated **three independent approaches** using different strategic lenses:

### **Approach A: Stalled Planning Revival + Liquidation**
- **Best for:** Highest motivation, fastest execution, extreme negotiation leverage
- **Capital:** £20k-£60k upfront
- **Profit:** £900k-£2.4M
- **Risk:** Low-medium (planning precedent exists, forced sale)
- **Timeline:** 16-24 months

### **Approach B: Airspace Development**
- **Best for:** Capital efficiency, incremental value, London high-density zones
- **Capital:** £115k-£200k
- **Profit:** £820k-£1.62M per deal (do 2-3 deals = £2M+ total)
- **Risk:** Medium (structural + freeholder negotiation)
- **Timeline:** 19-24 months

### **Approach C: Strategic Precedent Matching**
- **Best for:** Planning de-risking, replicating proven approvals, information arbitrage
- **Capital:** £120k-£150k
- **Profit:** £1.67M-£2.67M
- **Risk:** Low-medium (precedent provides strong material consideration)
- **Timeline:** 24-36 months

### **My Recommendation: Test All Three in Parallel**

These approaches are **complementary, not competing**:
- **Approach A** targets liquidation companies (rare but extreme motivation)
- **Approach B** targets physical characteristics (flat roofs, high PTAL)
- **Approach C** targets planning precedent (adjacency to approvals)

**Parallel execution strategy:**
1. Run all three SearchLand filters simultaneously
2. **Week 1:** Approach A likely yields 5-20 results (narrow) → **prioritize these first** (liquidators move fast)
3. **Week 2:** Approach C yields 3-10 precedent approvals → **manual adjacency research** (identify nearby unapproved sites)
4. **Week 3:** Approach B yields 10-30 airspace opportunities → **structural desktop review** (Street View for flat roofs)
5. **Weeks 4-8:** Pursue best 5-10 opportunities across all approaches

**Capital allocation across approaches:**
- **£60k:** Approach A (1-2 liquidation options)
- **£80k:** Approach B (1 airspace deal)
- **£60k:** Approach C (1-2 precedent-adjacent options)
- **Total:** £200k ✅

**Expected outcome:** 3-5 live options across different strategies, **at least one** achieves £2M+ profit.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Why This Multi-Approach Strategy Works:**
The v7.0 system's philosophy is **divergent generation → empirical testing → convergence on what works**. By testing three fundamentally different approaches (motivation-driven, physical characteristics, precedent analysis), you're hedging against:
- Market variations (liquidation opportunities are rare but high-value)
- Geographic differences (PTAL approach London-only, precedent approach UK-wide)
- Timing (liquidation = fast, precedent = slower but higher certainty)

This mirrors how successful property sourcing actually works: **multiple strategies running in parallel, with capital allocated dynamically based on live deal flow**.
