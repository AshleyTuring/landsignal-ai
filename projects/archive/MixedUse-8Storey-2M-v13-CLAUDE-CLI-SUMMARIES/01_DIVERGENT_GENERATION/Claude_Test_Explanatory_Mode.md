## Summary & Recommendations

★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
These three approaches represent fundamentally different lenses on the same problem: **Approach A** uses planning precedent (certainty-focused), **Approach B** exploits regulatory deadlines (motivation-driven), and **Approach C** leverages timing + structural arbitrage (speed + innovation). Each has distinct risk/reward profiles and capital deployment strategies suitable for £200k constraints.

### Approach Comparison

| Criteria | Approach A (Stalled Planning) | Approach B (Lease Expiry) | Approach C (Airspace + Time) |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Capital Required** | £15k-£65k | £50k-£100k | £60k-£160k |
| **Expected Results** | 5-20 properties | 10-30 properties | 15-40 properties |
| **Risk Level** | Medium | Low-Medium | Medium-High |
| **Timeline** | 18-24 months | 12-18 months | 12-24 months |
| **Profit Potential** | £500k-£2M | £800k-£2M | £400k-£2M per site |
| **Scalability** | Low (rare sites) | Medium | High (repeatable) |
| **Competition** | Medium | Low (time-sensitive) | Very Low (speed advantage) |

### Testing Strategy

Given the independent generation workflow, I recommend:

1. **Run all three in parallel** across test geographies (Slough, Birmingham, Manchester)
2. **Measure results empirically** (property count, quality, motivation signals)
3. **Fast iteration** on Approach C (daily monitoring = fastest feedback loop)
4. **Capital allocation:** Start with Approach A (lowest capital), scale to C if successful

### Geographic Considerations

- **Slough:** Test Approach A (precedent-based) - previous testing location
- **Birmingham:** Test Approach B (lease expiry) - lower prices, more commercial options
- **Manchester:** Test Approach C (airspace) - mid-range market, good transport infrastructure
- **London:** Consider for Approach C (highest PTAL scores, strongest airspace market)

All approaches are **copy-paste ready** for SearchLand AI and require **zero additional file reading** per your instructions. Each leverages different patterns from the reference materials to ensure diversity and avoid echo chamber convergence.
