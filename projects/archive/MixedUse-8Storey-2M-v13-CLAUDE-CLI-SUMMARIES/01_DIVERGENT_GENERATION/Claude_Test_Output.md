## Summary & Recommendations

### Approach Selection Matrix

| Approach | Capital | Risk | Timeline | Expected Results | Best For |
|----------|---------|------|----------|------------------|----------|
| **A: Stalled 8-Storey Revival** | £45k-£180k | Medium | 12-18m | 5-15 properties | Direct precedent, distressed sellers |
| **B: HMO Airspace** | £130k-£205k | Medium-High | 18-24m | 10-25 properties | Structural opportunity, dual motivation |
| **C: Emerging Allocation** | £20k-£60k | Low-Medium | 18-24m | 8-20 properties | **LOWEST CAPITAL**, policy backing |

### Recommended Priority Order

1. **Start with Approach C (Emerging Allocation)**
   - Lowest capital (£20k-£60k)
   - Highest upside (£2M-£3.5M profit potential)
   - Policy backing (emerging allocation)
   - First mover advantage
   - Can run in parallel with other approaches

2. **Pursue Approach A (Stalled Planning) in parallel**
   - Direct Type 2 requirement satisfaction (8-storey mixed-use precedent)
   - Strong motivation (liquidation/administration)
   - Planning work already done
   - Complementary to Approach C (different risk profile)

3. **Consider Approach B (HMO Airspace) as tertiary**
   - Higher capital requirement (may exceed £200k)
   - More technical (structural survey critical)
   - Good for Phase 2 once initial deals complete

### Testing Strategy

Given your v7.0 system architecture (4 independent LLMs), I recommend:

**Parallel Testing:**
- **Test all 3 approaches simultaneously** in target geographies
- Slough (primary), Birmingham, Manchester (secondary)
- Each approach generates 8-25 results = 24-75 total properties to evaluate

**Empirical Validation:**
- Run filters week 1
- Screen results week 2-3
- Approach top 5 candidates per approach week 4-6
- Report back which approach yields best responses

### Key Success Factors

**For ALL Approaches:**
1. **Motivation is critical** - regulation, distress, legacy holdings
2. **Transport proximity** - supports density/height arguments
3. **Policy support** - allocations, precedents, PTAL/accessibility
4. **Low capital entry** - options, distressed pricing, phased structures
5. **Exit strategy** - housebuilders, developers, JV partners identified early

**Geographic Adaptation:**
- **London:** Use PTAL filters (PTAL 4-6), higher pricing, more competition
- **Birmingham/Manchester:** Use "Distance to Train Station", lower entry prices
- **Slough:** Test market (previous v1-v6 location), moderate pricing

## Next Steps

1. **Run all 3 approaches in SearchLand** (parallel testing)
2. **Export results to CSV** for analysis
3. **Desktop screening:**
   - Land Registry checks (£3 per title)
   - Planning history review (free via Planning Portal)
   - Company status verification (free via Companies House)
4. **Top 5 per approach:** Direct outreach (letters/calls)
5. **Report findings:** Which approach yields best responses
6. **Iterate filters** based on empirical results

**Budget for Testing Phase:**
- SearchLand subscription: Included
- Land Registry searches: £3 × 15 properties = £45
- Planning consultant desktop review: £500-£1,000 (optional)
- **Total: <£1,500 for comprehensive testing**

This positions you to identify the highest-ROI approach before committing significant capital, while maintaining focus on your £2M profit target and £200k capital constraint.
