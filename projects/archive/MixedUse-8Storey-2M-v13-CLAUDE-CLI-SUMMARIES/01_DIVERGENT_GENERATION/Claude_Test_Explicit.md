## Summary: Strategic Comparison

| Approach | Capital | Risk | Timeline | ROI Potential | Best For |
|----------|---------|------|----------|---------------|----------|
| **A: Precedent Replication** | £60k-£180k | Medium | 18-24m | £2M+ | Planning expertise, relationship-based sourcing |
| **B: Airspace Rights** | £50k-£150k* | Medium-High | 16-24m | £850k-£2.35M | Structural knowledge, creative financing |
| **C: Liquidation/Stalled** | £150k-£385k** | Medium | 18-24m | £1.65M-£2.85M | Fast execution, cash available, legal expertise |

*Can reduce to £50k-£100k via overage structures  
**Can reduce via bridging finance or JV on planning costs

## Recommended Execution Strategy

**Portfolio Approach (Recommended):**
Run all three approaches in parallel:

1. **Approach A (2-3 sites):** Option agreements on precedent-match sites (£20k-£50k per option)
2. **Approach B (2-3 sites):** Airspace rights with overage structures (£30k-£60k upfront per site)  
3. **Approach C (1-2 sites):** Liquidation opportunities (£100k-£200k cash required)

**Total capital deployed:** £170k-£310k across 5-8 sites

**Expected outcome:**
- 1-2 sites gain planning consent
- 1 site sells with consent for £2M-£3M
- **Net profit:** £1.7M-£2.8M after all costs

**Why portfolio approach?**
- **Risk diversification:** Not reliant on single site
- **Multiple exit routes:** Planning, airspace, distressed sale
- **Learning curve:** First site teaches you process for others
- **Timing optionality:** Exit best site first, hold others for longer

## Geographic Targeting Recommendations

**Primary Market: Slough/Birmingham/Manchester**
- **Why:** Lower land values (easier to stay within £200k), good transport, mixed-use precedents
- **Approach A:** Run filter in all three cities
- **Approach B:** Focus on 1960s-1990s commercial areas (Slough industrial estates, Birmingham city fringe)
- **Approach C:** Birmingham/Manchester higher liquidation volumes (more industrial companies)

**Secondary Market: London (Zones 3-5)**
- **Why:** PTAL 4+ supports tall buildings, higher exit values, but higher acquisition costs
- **Approach A:** May exceed £200k capital (use options only)
- **Approach B:** Best opportunity (airspace rights cheaper than full site acquisition)
- **Approach C:** Fewer liquidations, higher competition

**Test Strategy:**
1. Run all three filters in Slough (benchmark)
2. Run in Birmingham (lower cost market)
3. Compare result volumes and pricing
4. Focus capital on best-value market
