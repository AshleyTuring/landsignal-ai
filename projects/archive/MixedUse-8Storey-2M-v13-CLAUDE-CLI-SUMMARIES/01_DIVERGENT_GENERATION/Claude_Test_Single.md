## 3. Rationale

This approach targets **forced sellers** (liquidation/administration) with **low-rise commercial buildings** that have airspace development potential for mixed-use schemes.

**Strategic Logic:**
- **Pattern 2D (Liquidation Sales):** Company status = Liquidation creates VERY STRONG motivation (forced sale by law)
- **Pattern 6A (Airspace Development):** Flat roofs + low height (8-15m = 2-4 storeys) = add 4-6 storeys residential above
- **Pattern 8B (Regulation-Driven):** Commercial property in liquidation = distressed pricing (20-40% below market)
- **Precedent Match:** Existing 2-4 storey commercial → 8-storey mixed-use (matches your planning application)

**Capital Structure:**
- £50k-£150k: Airspace rights purchase from liquidator (discounted due to forced sale)
- £50k: Legal, surveys, planning consultancy
- Total outlay: £100k-£200k ✅ Within budget

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Buy airspace rights: £100k-£150k (distressed pricing)
- Secure planning for 8-storey mixed-use: 12-18 months
- Sell to developer with consent: £2M-£3M (8-10 units × £300k-£400k GDV)
- **Net profit: £1.85M-£2.85M** (targeting £2M+) ✅

---

## 4. Strengths

- ✅ **FORCED SALE = Maximum Negotiation Leverage:** Liquidators legally obligated to sell assets quickly
- ✅ **Low Capital Entry:** Airspace rights (not freehold) = £100k-£200k vs £1M+ for full building
- ✅ **Double Motivation:** Liquidation (forced) + Commercial property (non-core asset)
- ✅ **Planning Precedent:** Your 8-storey mixed-use application proves concept viability
- ✅ **Transport Accessibility:** <800m train station supports residential density (planning policy)
- ✅ **Flat Roof Filter:** Eliminates pitched roofs (structural complexity/cost)
- ✅ **Low Existing Height:** 8-15m (2-4 storeys) = room for 4-6 storey addition = 8-storey total
- ✅ **Clear Exit Strategy:** Sell planning consent to housebuilder (no build-out risk)
- ✅ **Time-Sensitive:** Liquidators motivated to close within 3-6 months (speed advantage)

## 5. Limitations

- ⚠️ **Very Small Pool:** Liquidation + flat roof + specific size = likely 5-20 properties UK-wide
- ⚠️ **Structural Survey Critical:** Not all buildings support additional storeys (£5k-£15k survey cost)
- ⚠️ **Freeholder Negotiation:** Must negotiate airspace agreement (liquidator may not understand value)
- ⚠️ **Planning Risk:** 8-storey not guaranteed (need tall building policy or precedent nearby)
- ⚠️ **Competition:** Other buyers may target liquidation sales (though airspace angle less obvious)
- ⚠️ **Legal Complexity:** Liquidation process can be slow (creditors, administrators)
- ⚠️ **No Income During Planning:** 12-18 month planning period with no rental income
- ⚠️ **Title Issues:** Liquidation properties may have charges/liens (legal due diligence essential)

## 6. Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Site Identification (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Run SearchLand filter** above in target geographies:
   - Priority: Slough, Birmingham, Manchester (per requirements)
   - Secondary: London (PTAL 4+), Leeds, Sheffield
2. **Screen results** for:
   - Building condition (Google Street View)
   - Neighboring heights (planning precedent)
   - Local tall building policy (LPA research)
3. **Shortlist 5-10 properties** with highest potential

### Phase 2: Due Diligence (Weeks 5-8)
1. **Land Registry searches:** Confirm title, charges, ownership
2. **Liquidator contact:** Identify administrator/liquidator via Companies House
3. **Structural desktop study:** Visual assessment (£2k-£5k per site)
4. **Planning research:**
   - Recent tall building approvals within 500m
   - Local plan policies (tall building zones, opportunity areas)
   - Pre-application advice (£1k-£3k per LPA)
5. **Valuation analysis:**
   - GDV calculation: 8-10 units × £300k-£400k = £2.4M-£4M
   - Build cost estimate: £2k-£3k/sqm × 800-1,200 sqm = £1.6M-£3.6M
   - Developer profit: 20% GDV = £480k-£800k
   - **Residual land value:** £320k-£600k (what developer will pay for consented site)
   - **Target acquisition:** £100k-£200k (50% discount due to liquidation urgency)

### Phase 3: Negotiation & Acquisition (Weeks 9-16)
1. **Approach liquidator** with Letter of Intent:
   - "We are cash buyers ready to complete within 60 days"
   - Offer £100k-£150k for airspace rights (NOT freehold)
   - Emphasize speed (liquidators prioritize quick sales)
2. **Structure deal:**
   - **Option A:** Purchase airspace rights outright (£100k-£200k)
   - **Option B:** Option agreement with overage (£20k upfront + 30% of planning uplift)
   - **Option C (if liquidator resists):** Joint venture (50/50 profit split, lower upfront capital)
3. **Legal completion:**
   - Solicitor: £10k-£20k (complex due to liquidation)
   - Structural survey: £5k-£15k (full load-bearing analysis)
   - Planning consultancy retainer: £15k-£30k
   - **Total legal/advisory:** £30k-£65k

### Phase 4: Planning Application (Months 5-18)
1. **Architect brief:** 8-storey mixed-use scheme
   - Ground floor: Retain existing commercial (Class E)
   - Floors 1-7: Residential (8-10 units, Class C3)
   - Amenities: Communal terrace, cycle parking, accessible parking (match precedent)
2. **Pre-application consultation:** Submit to LPA (£1k-£3k)
3. **Full planning application:** £10k-£30k (architect, planning consultant, surveys)
4. **Planning approval:** 12-18 months (Section 106 negotiations likely)
5. **Total planning costs:** £25k-£60k

### Phase 5: Exit (Months 18-24)
1. **Market to developers:**
   - Housebuilders (regional and national)
   - Build-to-rent funds (institutional buyers)
   - Private developers (local specialists)
2. **Valuation:**
   - GDV: £2.4M-£4M (8-10 units)
   - Build cost: £1.6M-£3.6M
   - Developer profit: 20% = £480k-£800k
   - **Residual site value:** £320k-£600k (what they'll pay)
3. **Sale price negotiation:** Target £2M-£3M (planning uplift + consent premium)
4. **Net profit calculation:**
   - Sale price: £2M-£3M
   - Less acquisition: £100k-£200k
   - Less legal/advisory: £30k-£65k
   - Less planning costs: £25k-£60k
   - **Net profit: £1.585M-£2.705M** ✅ Exceeds £2M target

## Expected Results

**Property Count:** 5-20 properties UK-wide (highly targeted)

**Conversion Rate:** 20-40% (1-8 viable opportunities from initial results)

**Timeline:** 18-24 months (acquisition to planning consent to exit)

**Profit Target:** £1.585M-£2.705M net profit ✅ **Exceeds £2M goal**

**Risk-Adjusted ROI:** 
- Best case: £2.7M profit ÷ £200k capital = **1,250% ROI**
- Target case: £2M profit ÷ £200k capital = **900% ROI**
- Worst case: £1.585M profit ÷ £200k capital = **692% ROI**

---

## Geographic Focus

**Priority Testing Order:**
1. **Birmingham:** Lower property prices, motivated liquidators, tall building precedents
2. **Manchester:** Mid-range market, strong residential demand, transport links
3. **Slough:** Your precedent location (familiarity advantage)
4. **London (Outer):** PTAL 4+ zones, highest GDV but more competition

**Rationale:** Birmingham likely to yield most results at target capital level (£100k-£150k airspace rights more achievable than London £300k+)
