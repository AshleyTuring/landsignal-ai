### Approach A: Precedent-Based Mixed-Use Intensification

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A: Under-Developed + High Accessibility  
**Capital Required:** £150k-£200k (option agreements £50k-£100k, planning costs £50k-£100k)  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Ownership type: is equal to Company
```

**Rationale:**  
This approach targets sites with similar 8-storey mixed-use planning precedents (Class E ground + C3 residential above) in urban areas with good transport access. By focusing on under-developed plots with inactive buildings and corporate ownership, it identifies stalled opportunities where planning work exists but development hasn't progressed, allowing for quick planning resubmission or intensification to achieve the 8-storey scale. The capital-efficient option structure fits within £200k while targeting £2M profit through value uplift from planning derisking.

**Strengths:**
- Leverages existing planning precedents for faster approval timelines (12-18 months vs. 24+ months)
- High transport accessibility supports density and market value
- Corporate owners may be motivated to divest non-core assets
- Unconstrained plots minimize planning obstacles

**Limitations:**
- Requires manual review of planning history to confirm 8-storey precedents
- Transport proximity may increase competition in prime locations
- Inactive buildings could have hidden structural issues
- Corporate negotiation may take longer than private sellers

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 20-40 sites with mixed-use planning history
2. Manually verify planning applications for 8-storey approvals in urban areas like Birmingham or Manchester
3. Approach corporate owners with option proposals (£50k-£100k deposits) contingent on planning approval
4. Secure planning permission for 8-storey intensification (Class E + C3)
5. Exit via sale to housebuilder or developer at planning stage for £2M+ profit

### Approach B: Capital-Efficient Option Candidates

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4B: Option Agreement Candidates  
**Capital Required:** £50k-£150k (option fees £10k-£50k, legals £5k-£15k, minimal upfront)  
**Expected Results:** 30-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Latest sold date: No latest sold date
2. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
5. NOT: Sales listing currently on the market
6. Freehold tenure
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
```

**Rationale:**  
This strategy identifies legacy holdings (never sold, private owners) with no recent planning activity, suitable for option agreements within the £200k capital limit. These sites match the planning application characteristics (large enough for 8-storey, transport-accessible, unconstrained) but are off-market, allowing low-capital control while pursuing mixed-use development. The £2M profit target is achievable through phased development and exit to institutional buyers, with minimal upfront risk.

**Strengths:**
- Extremely low capital entry (£10k-£50k options) preserves capital for development
- Private legacy owners often unaware of development potential, creating negotiation leverage
- Off-market approach avoids competition and price inflation
- Transport proximity and unconstrained plots support 8-storey mixed-use viability

**Limitations:**
- Requires relationship-building with private owners (time-intensive)
- No recent planning activity may indicate owner disinterest
- Legacy holdings could have complex title issues
- Profit realization depends on successful planning and exit

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for 30-50 off-market legacy sites near transport hubs
2. Research owners via Land Registry and approach with option proposals
3. Secure options (£10k-£50k) for 12-24 months, contingent on planning
4. Apply for 8-storey mixed-use planning (Class E + C3) in urban areas
5. Develop in phases or sell options to developers for £2M+ profit

### Approach C: Airspace Development Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom  
**Capital Required:** £100k-£200k (airspace rights £50k-£150k, structural surveys £5k-£15k)  
**Expected Results:** 15-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
6. Ownership type: is equal to Company
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
```

**Rationale:**  
Targeting existing commercial buildings with flat roofs and height headroom (under 15m) in transport-accessible urban areas, this approach replicates the planning application's mixed-use model by adding 4-6 storeys of residential above commercial ground floors. Corporate ownership and unconstrained plots fit the precedent characteristics, with airspace rights providing a capital-efficient path to £2M profit through value addition without full site acquisition.

**Strengths:**
- Existing infrastructure (utilities, access) reduces development costs
- Flat roofs enable straightforward residential extensions
- Corporate owners may negotiate airspace rights separately
- Transport proximity supports the density required for 8-storey viability

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural assessments to confirm height capacity
- Freeholder negotiation for airspace rights can be complex
- Planning for height additions may face local opposition
- Commercial use class may need change of use permissions

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify 15-30 commercial buildings with flat roofs and height potential
2. Conduct structural surveys (£5k-£15k) to confirm capacity for 4-6 additional storeys
3. Negotiate airspace rights (£50k-£150k) with corporate freeholders
4. Obtain planning for 8-storey mixed-use intensification
5. Develop residential above commercial or sell rights to developers for £2M+ profit
