### Approach A: Mid-Rise Precedent Replays  
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5B – High-Density/Intensification (matching approved 8-storey mixed-use precedents)  
**Capital Required:** c.£190k (Option premium £80k + planning/transport/Daylight & Sunlight studies £70k + legals & JV structuring £40k)  
**Expected Results:** 70‑110 titles UK-wide matching prior 8-storey approvals

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**  
```
1. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.20 AND less than 1.20
2. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
3. Proposal: contains "Class E"
4. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 35
5. Applications in the last 5 years: is greater than 0 AND less than or equal to 3
6. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 25
```

**Rationale:** Replays the exact precedent brief—sites that already trialed mid-rise mixed-use but have sub-15 m existing stock, meaning air-rights/value-add potential without competing tall stock. Optioning approved-but-unbuilt consents fits £200k capital via deposits and design uplift spending rather than acquisition.  
**Strengths:**  
- Directly evidences precedent for 8-storey retail/C3 mix.  
- Sub-15 m existing height highlights vertical uplift headroom.  
- Brownfield signal plus limited application activity points to stalled owners open to option structures.  
**Limitations:**  
- Filter relies on accurate proposal keywords; may miss coded descriptions.  
- Sites with >3 recent apps excluded even if viable.  
**Implementation Strategy:** Export shortlist, rank by location demand (London fringe, Birmingham CBD, Manchester inner ring), approach owners/agents for short-term planning uplift JVs, and recycle design pack from precedent to accelerate resubmissions or S73 tweaks.

### Approach B: Flat-Roof Airspace JVs  
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A – Airspace Development (optioning transport-adjacent flat roofs)  
**Capital Required:** c.£165k (Access & structural surveys £45k + legal/option/valuation fees £55k + planning & design reserve £65k)  
**Expected Results:** 90‑140 titles across Tier‑1/2 city centers

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**  
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: equals Yes
2. Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 2 AND less than or equal to 4
3. Title area (acres): is less than 0.35
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
5. Sales listing currently on the market: equals Yes
6. Sales listing status: is one of Available, Under Offer
7. Ownership type: Company
8. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 40
```

**Rationale:** Targets mid-rise commercial blocks with flat roofs near strong transport nodes, ideal for Class AA/airspace hybrids delivering 2‑4 additional storeys. Corporate vendors already marketing assets are primed for JV/roof lease deals, enabling control with survey/option spend inside £200k.  
**Strengths:**  
- Flat-roof + ≤4 floors keeps structural loads manageable.  
- Active listings + corporate owners create a negotiation path for non-cash acquisition.  
- Dense brownfield footprints support mixed-use infill (ground retail retained).  
**Limitations:**  
- Reliant on data accuracy for roof type/floor count.  
- Competition from rooftop hospitality/solar operators in prime zones.  
**Implementation Strategy:** Filter outputs, screen for blocks with existing lifts/cores, run structural pre-feasibility, pitch rooftop lease premium funded by operator, and file airspace application tying in amenity terraces to win support.

### Approach C: Distressed Mixed-Use Control  
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D – Liquidation/Administration (motivated seller unlock)  
**Capital Required:** c.£175k (Option deposits £60k + administrator legal fees £35k + planning/design refresh £80k)  
**Expected Results:** 40‑70 titles nationally (smaller but highly motivated cohort)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**  
```
1. Ownership type: Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Proposal: contains "retail"
4. Proposal: contains "residential"
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.80
6. Distance to nearest built up area (m): is less than 50
7. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 30
8. Latest sold date: is before 2018-01-01
```

**Rationale:** Combines insolvency signals with mixed-use planning history on urban brownfield land. Administrators must monetize quickly, allowing low-capital option or deferred consideration deals anchored by planning uplift.  
**Strengths:**  
- Hard motivation increases odds of agreeing option/JV within £200k spend.  
- Existing mixed-use proposals reduce planning risk and align with retail/C3 brief.  
- Pre-2018 last sale indicates embedded equity for creditors.  
**Limitations:**  
- Smaller dataset; requires rapid outreach before auctions.  
- Insolvency cases may have legal encumbrances needing due diligence.  
**Implementation Strategy:** Contact insolvency practitioners from Companies House data, structure exclusivity + phased payments, refresh planning packs (transport, accessibility, amenity terraces) to align with contemporary policy, and secure JV equity once consent certainty achieved.

Natural next steps: 1) Run each prompt in SearchLand, export results, and score by city priority/ownership complexity. 2) Commence outreach templates tailored to option/JV pitch highlighting £2M profit target and 12‑24 month planning timeline.
