I need to locate the reference materials mentioned in the prompt (`AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md`, and `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`) to generate the property search strategies. I will start by searching for a `SearchlandContext` directory in the parent directory, as hinted in the prompt.
Error executing tool list_directory: Path must be within one of the workspace directories: /home/ashsubband/landsignal/projects/MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v5/.agents
My attempt to access the parent directory failed as I am restricted to the `.agents` directory. The required reference files, such as `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`, were not found in the initial directory listing. I will try to locate them using the `glob` tool to search the entire project structure for these files, as they are essential for completing your request.call:glob{pattern:
I've confirmed `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` is not in my workspace. I'll now check for `FILTER_PATTERNS.md` and `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` to confirm they are also missing before proceeding.call:glob{pattern:
`FILTER_PATTERNS.md` is also missing. I'll now check for `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`.call:glob{pattern:
I am unable to proceed. The core reference files required to generate the search strategies (`AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md`, and `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`) are not accessible in my current workspace.

To fulfill your request, please provide the contents of these three files.
