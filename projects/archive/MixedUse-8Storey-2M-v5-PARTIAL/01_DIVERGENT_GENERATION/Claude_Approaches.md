## Approach C: Precedent-Based 8-Storey Search

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Proposal: contains "8-storey" OR contains "eight storey" OR contains "8 storey"
2. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" OR contains "mixed use"
3. Use class (current or previous): E, A1, A2, A3, B1, C3
4. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 15 AND less than 80
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2.5
6. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 800m
7. NOT: Flood zone 3, Listed building, Conservation area
8. Last application submitted: after 2020-01-01
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly searches for properties that have already received planning approval for 8-storey mixed-use developments - the exact precedent we're targeting. By filtering for proposals containing "8-storey" and "mixed-use", combined with dwelling counts (15-80 units) and appropriate title area (0.2-2.5 acres), we find sites that have already proven their viability. This significantly de-risks the planning process.

The key insight from FILTER_PATTERNS.md Pattern 3A is that approved planning applications demonstrate what local authorities will accept. We're not guessing about policy support - we're finding sites where it's already been granted.

**Strengths:**
- **Lowest Planning Risk:** Site has demonstrated 8-storey approval precedent
- **Proven Economics:** Dwelling count suggests viable development density
- **Clear Comparables:** Can model GDV based on approved scheme
- **Motivated Sellers:** Approved sites without construction often indicate capital constraints
- **Replicable:** Can find adjacent/similar sites using same criteria

**Limitations:**
- **Competition:** Approved sites attract multiple bidders
- **Time Sensitivity:** Planning permissions lapse (typically 3 years)
- **Potential Overpay:** Seller aware of site value with consent
- **Started Developments:** Some may have already commenced (need to filter manually)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Run Search:** Execute in Slough, Birmingham, Manchester
2. **Filter Results:** Remove any sites where construction has started (check aerial imagery)
3. **Title Check:** Verify ownership, no ransom strips or access issues
4. **Planning Status:** Confirm permission still valid (not lapsed or implemented)
5. **Approach Owner:** 
   - If company: Propose joint venture or acquisition (£150k option + profit share)
   - If individual: Option agreement (£25k-£50k for 12-24 months)
6. **Structure Deal:**
   - Option Agreement: £50k option fee + £100k legals/surveys
   - OR Direct Purchase: £150k (if small site with consent)
   - OR JV: £75k for planning certainty + profit share on delivery

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Agreement Fee (12-24 months): £50,000
- Legal & Surveys: £40,000
- Planning Refresh/Variation Costs: £30,000
- Contingency: £30,000
- **Total:** £150,000

## Approach D: Corporate Distress + Height Potential

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration) + Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones)  
**Capital Required:** £180,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Company status: Liquidation, Administration
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 3
4. Use class (current or previous): E, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, Sui Generis
5. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 1000m
6. NOT: Flood zone 3, Green Belt, Article 4 direction
7. Ownership type: Company
```

**Rationale:**
This approach combines two powerful motivations: **forced sale due to liquidation** (Pattern 2D - discovered by user in Stage 2 peer review) and **hidden height potential** (Pattern 5A). Companies in liquidation must dispose of assets quickly, often below market value. By targeting low-rise commercial properties (<15m) near train stations on plots of 0.3-3 acres, we find sites with significant upside through vertical intensification.

The strategic insight is that liquidators focus on quick disposal, not maximizing development potential. A 1-storey warehouse in liquidation might be sold at land value, but if it's in an area supporting tall buildings, the buyer can extract 8-storey residential value.

**Strengths:**
- **Forced Sale Urgency:** Liquidation = must sell (strong negotiating position)
- **Below-Market Pricing:** Liquidators prioritize speed over price
- **Height Upside:** Current use vastly underutilizes site potential
- **Lower Competition:** Requires combining distress + development vision
- **Clear Exit:** Redevelop or flip to developer with planning

**Limitations:**
- **Due Diligence Complexity:** Liquidation assets may have hidden liabilities
- **Contamination Risk:** Industrial/commercial sites may need remediation
- **Planning Uncertainty:** Need to verify local policy supports height
- **Timeline Pressure:** Liquidators may set short timelines for bids
- **No Warranty:** Typically sold "as is" with limited recourse

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Run Search:** Focus on urban areas (Birmingham, Manchester for affordability)
2. **Quick Filter:** Check building height on Google Earth (verify <15m)
3. **Local Policy Check:** Verify area supports tall buildings/densification
4. **Liquidator Contact:** Approach quickly with cash offer + proof of funds
5. **Fast Due Diligence:** 
   - Phase 1 contamination survey (£5k-£10k)
   - Title check (no restrictions on height)
   - Planning officer pre-app discussion (informal)
6. **Structure Deal:**
   - Cash Acquisition: £120k-£150k (liquidators love cash)
   - Planning Application: £20k-£30k
   - Option to Hold or Flip: Exit once consent secured

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Site Acquisition (liquidation discount): £130,000
- Contamination Survey: £8,000
- Legal & Title Fees: £15,000
- Planning Pre-App & Application: £20,000
- Contingency (liquidation risks): £7,000
- **Total:** £180,000

## Approach E: Stalled Planning + Expired Consent

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A (Old Planning + No Recent Activity)  
**Capital Required:** £120,000  
**Expected Results:** 15-35 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Last application submitted: before 2020-01-01
2. Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 10
4. Building on title is inactive: Yes OR Building on title is derelict: Yes
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.3 AND less than 2
6. Latest sold date: No latest sold date (never sold)
7. Ownership type: Private owner OR Company
8. Use class (current or previous): E, A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, C3
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets the "forgotten development" - sites that had planning applications pre-2020 but were never developed, with owners who may have inherited the property or lost momentum. The combination of old planning (before 2020), inactive/derelict buildings, never sold (inherited/legacy), and no recent applications (<1 in 5 years) indicates an owner who:
- May not know current value with planning potential
- Lost interest/capital after previous planning attempt
- Inherited the property without development expertise

From FILTER_PATTERNS.md Pattern 1A, these sites often had planning work already done but stalled due to owner circumstances, not site issues. This means planning precedent exists (even if lapsed), reducing future application risk.

**Strengths:**
- **Low Competition:** Stalled sites overlooked by active developers
- **Planning Precedent:** Previous applications show viability
- **Owner Motivation:** Long hold + inactivity = open to offers
- **Existing Intelligence:** Can review old planning docs for scheme design
- **Below-Market Entry:** Owner may accept £100k-£150k for inherited burden

**Limitations:**
- **Planning Lapse:** Consents >3 years old are expired, need reapplication
- **Policy Changes:** Planning policy may have changed since 2020
- **Derelict Condition:** May require demolition/remediation
- **Owner Tracing:** "Never sold" may mean complex ownership (estates, trusts)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Run Search:** UK-wide (focus on affordable areas first)
2. **Research Planning History:** Download old applications from LPA portal
3. **Policy Check:** Verify current policy still supports similar development
4. **Owner Tracing:** 
   - Land Registry search: £3
   - Contact via letter (professional, clear offer)
5. **Approach Strategy:**
   - Frame as "solution" to inactive asset
   - Offer cash (£80k-£120k depending on location)
   - OR Option Agreement (£20k-£40k for 18 months)
6. **Planning Strategy:**
   - Use old application as template
   - Pre-app with LPA (reference previous approval)
   - Resubmit with updated scheme

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Site Acquisition: £100,000
- Land Registry & Due Diligence: £5,000
- Planning Application & Pre-App: £10,000
- Contingency: £5,000
- **Total:** £120,000

## Summary of Claude's Approaches

**Approach C (Precedent-Based):** Lowest risk - finds sites with proven 8-storey approvals  
**Approach D (Corporate Distress):** Opportunistic - combines forced sale + height upside  
**Approach E (Stalled Planning):** Value play - targets forgotten sites with planning history

**Strategic Lenses Applied:**
- **Risk Mitigation:** All approaches reduce planning risk via precedent/policy
- **Behavioral Signals:** Liquidation (forced), never sold (inherited), inactive (forgotten)
- **Precedent Analysis:** Approach C directly targets 8-storey approvals

**Capital Efficiency:** All approaches £120k-£180k (within £200k budget)  
**Diversity:** Each targets different motivation (approved sites, distress, stalled)  
**Exit Strategy:** All can flip with planning or develop via JV
