# CRITICAL DISCOVERY: D-3 Properties Are HUGE

**Date:** 2024-12-04  
**Finding:** D-3 (Class MA + Liquidation) properties are 2-8 acres - too large for £200k budget

---

## 🚨 The Problem with D-3

When we exported the D-3 properties, we discovered they're MASSIVE:

| Property | Location | Size | Capital Needed (Estimate) |
|----------|----------|------|---------------------------|
| The Granary | Harlow | 2.71 acres (10,973 sqm) | £500k-£800k+ |
| Burnt Mills Road | Basildon | 6.87 acres (27,803 sqm) | £1M-£2M+ |
| 18 Cardup Way | Basildon | 8.13 acres (32,900 sqm) | £1.5M-£3M+ |
| Sarah Court | Southend | ~2+ acres (estimate) | £500k-£1M+ |
| 107 Baddow Road | Chelmsford | Unknown | TBD |
| Unit 1, Gazehill | Wickford | Unknown | TBD |

**Average size:** 2-8 acres per property

**Why this is a problem:**
- Your budget: £200k cash
- D-3 capital needed: £500k-£3M+ per property
- **Gap:** Need to find £300k-£2.8M+ MORE capital
- **Solution:** Joint venture partner OR different strategy

**Why D-3 properties are so large:**
- "Class MA eligible commercial sites" preset targets industrial/commercial estates
- Companies in liquidation often own large facilities (warehouses, factories, business parks)
- Small commercial properties less likely to be owned by companies in liquidation

## 🎯 The Solution: Approach D-4

**You've already found it:** 23 properties from Test 2

**Test 2 filters:**
```
"Class MA sites filtered for potential profit"
+ Tenure: Freehold
+ Ownership type: Private owner
+ EPC rating: E, F, G
```

**Why D-4 may be THE answer:**

1. **Private owners, not companies**
   - Private individuals often own SMALLER commercial properties
   - Small office buildings, retail units, light industrial units
   - Potentially 0.5-2 acres instead of 2-8 acres

2. **23 properties to choose from**
   - 4x more options than D-3
   - Better chance of finding the perfect size

3. **Strong motivation (EPC)**
   - E/F/G ratings require upgrades (£20k-£100k+)
   - PRS regulations getting stricter
   - Owners may prefer to sell than upgrade

4. **Same profit mechanism**
   - Class MA conversion: Commercial → Residential
   - 2-3x value uplift (same as D-3)
   - Estimated profit: £150k-£500k per property

5. **Potentially achievable capital**
   - IF properties are 0.5-1.5 acres
   - Capital needed: £200k-£400k total
   - Your £200k + £100k-£200k bridging loan = ACHIEVABLE ✅

## 📊 Size Comparison (Estimated)

| Approach | Typical Property Size | Capital Needed | Your £200k Coverage |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **D-3: Liquidation** | 2-8 acres | £500k-£3M+ | 20-40% (need JV) ❌ |
| **D-4: Private+EPC** | 0.5-2 acres? | £200k-£500k? | 40-100% ✅ |

**Key assumption:** D-4 properties are SMALLER because they're owned by private individuals, not companies

**Need to verify:** Export all 23 D-4 properties and check actual sizes

## 🎯 The Critical Question

**Are D-4 properties SMALLER than D-3's 2-8 acre monsters?**

### IF YES (D-4 has properties under 1-2 acres):
✅ **D-4 is THE winner**
- Achievable capital (£200k + small bridge loan)
- Same profit mechanism (Class MA conversion)
- More properties to choose from (23 vs 6)
- Strong motivation (EPC compliance)
- **Profit: £150k-£500k per property** ✅ EXCEEDS TARGET

### IF NO (D-4 properties are also huge):
Need to decide between:
1. **Find JV partner** for D-3 or D-4 (high profit, need partner)
2. **Pivot to D-1/D-2** (lower profit £50k-£100k, fits budget solo)
3. **Raise more capital** (personal loan, mortgage refinance, etc.)

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps

**Step 1: Export D-4 Properties** (30-60 min)
- Go to SearchLand results for Test 2 (23 properties)
- Export to spreadsheet
- Get full addresses, owner names, property details
- **MOST IMPORTANT:** Note plot area and developed area for each property

**Step 2: Analyze Sizes** (30 min)
- Create table: Address | Owner | Plot area (sqm) | Dev area (sqm) | EPC
- Convert to acres (1 acre = 4,047 sqm)
- Categorize:
  - **Small** (<1 acre): Priority 1 - BEST for your capital
  - **Medium** (1-3 acres): Priority 2 - may need bridge
  - **Large** (>3 acres): Priority 3 - same as D-3

**Step 3: Count Results** (5 min)
- How many properties under 1 acre? _______
- How many properties 1-2 acres? _______
- How many properties over 2 acres? _______

**Step 4: Decision** (5 min)
```
IF (properties under 1 acre > 0):
    D-4 is THE winner ✅
    Focus on small D-4 properties
ELSE IF (properties under 2 acres > 3):
    D-4 is still viable (need larger bridge loan)
    Focus on 1-2 acre D-4 properties
ELSE:
    Consider alternatives:
    - Find JV partner for D-3/D-4
    - OR pivot to D-1/D-2
```

## 💡 Why Size Matters

**Example: 0.5 acre property vs 5 acre property**

### 0.5 Acre (2,023 sqm) - FITS YOUR BUDGET ✅
- Commercial value: £150k-£250k
- Your purchase (with discount): £120k-£200k
- Conversion to 2-3 flats: £100k-£150k
- **Total:** £220k-£350k
- **Your £200k covers:** 57-91% (need £20k-£150k bridge) ✅

**Profit:**
- 2-3 flats × £240k = £480k-£720k
- Less costs: -£220k-£350k
- **Net profit: £130k-£500k** ✅

### 5 Acre (20,234 sqm) - TOO BIG ❌
- Commercial value: £800k-£1.5M
- Your purchase (with discount): £640k-£1.2M
- Conversion to 15-20 flats: £600k-£1M
- **Total:** £1.24M-£2.2M
- **Your £200k covers:** 9-16% (need £1M-£2M MORE) ❌

**Profit:**
- 15-20 flats × £240k = £3.6M-£4.8M
- Less costs: -£1.24M-£2.2M
- **Net profit: £1.4M-£3.56M** 🔥 HUGE but UNACHIEVABLE solo

**Conclusion:** Small properties = achievable capital + good profit ✅
