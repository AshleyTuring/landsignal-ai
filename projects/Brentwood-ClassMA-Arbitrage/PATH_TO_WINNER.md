# Path to Winner Property - Decision Tree

**Date:** 2024-12-04  
**Goal:** Identify ONE property that definitely hits £150k+ profit target

## 🏆 Current Best Opportunity: Approach D-4 (Potentially)

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY: D-3 properties are HUGE (2-8 acres)**
- The Granary: 2.71 acres
- Burnt Mills Road: 6.87 acres  
- 18 Cardup Way: 8.13 acres
- **Result:** Need £500k-£2M+ capital (way over budget, need JV partner)

**NEW PRIORITY: Approach D-4 (23 properties - analyze first!)**

**Why D-4 may be THE winner:**
- **23 properties** (vs 6 in D-3) - more to choose from
- **Likely SMALLER sites** (D-3 had monsters, D-4 may have 0.5-2 acre sites)
- **Better capital fit** (potentially £260k-£350k all-in = doable with £200k + bridge)
- **Same profit mechanism:** Class MA conversion (commercial → residential = 2-3x uplift)
- **Strong motivation:** Poor EPC (E/F/G) + compliance deadline pressure
- **Freehold only:** Full control, no complications
- **Private owners:** Direct negotiation (simpler than administrators)

**Profit Example (if D-4 has smaller properties):**
- Buy small commercial at EPC discount: £150k (10-20% off due to EPC)
- Convert to 2-3 flats: £100k-£150k
- Sell flats: £480k-£720k (2-3 × £240k)
- **Profit: £180k-£420k** ✅ EXCEEDS £150k TARGET

**Capital fit:** £250k-£300k total (your £200k + £50k-£100k bridge) ✅ ACHIEVABLE

**Next Step:** Export all 23 D-4 properties and check sizes!

## 📊 Comparison: All 4 Approaches

| Approach | Properties | Profit Per Deal | Capital Needed | Capital Fit | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| **D-1: Expired Licenses** | 3 | £50k-£100k | £90k-£140k | ✅ Great | 3-6 months |
| **D-2: HMO Liquidation** | 2 | £25k-£45k | £100k-£120k | ✅ Great | 3-6 months |
| **D-3: Class MA Liquidation** | 6 | £500k-£2M+ | £500k-£2M+ | ❌ Need JV | 12-18 months |
| **D-4: Class MA Private+EPC** | 23 | £150k-£500k | £260k-£500k? | ❓ TBD | 9-12 months |

**Analysis:**
- **D-1 & D-2:** Low capital ✅, but low profit ❌ (won't hit £150k single deal)
- **D-3:** HUGE profit ✅, but HUGE capital ❌ (2-8 acre sites, need JV partner)
- **D-4:** Potentially perfect balance? Need to check property sizes!

**KEY QUESTION:** Are D-4 properties SMALLER than D-3's 2-8 acre monsters?

**If YES → D-4 is THE winner** (great profit + achievable capital)  
**If NO → Need to pick:** D-1/D-2 (lower profit, fits budget) OR D-3/D-4 (higher profit, need JV)

**Solutions:**
1. **Bridging finance:** £200k cash + £120k-£150k bridge loan
2. **Joint venture:** Your £200k = 40% stake, partner provides rest
3. **Smaller property:** Find one of the 8 that's under £300k all-in
4. **Phased:** Do D-1 first (£100k profit) → then use £300k for D-3

## 🎯 Recommended Strategy: Test BOTH Class MA Filters

**You asked:** "Should we test the normal Class MA filter too?"

**Answer:** YES - test both and compare!

### Test 1: Class MA + Liquidation (What you did) ✅
```
Preset: "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
+ Company status: Liquidation
+ Ownership type: Corporate/Company
Result: 8 properties
```

**Pros:** Forced sale (30-40% discount), very motivated
**Cons:** Need to verify liquidation status, may be complex sales

### Test 2: Class MA + Private Owner (Recommended)
```
Preset: "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
+ Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
+ EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
Result: TBD (run this now!)
```

**Why test this:**
- Private owners may be more motivated than you think (retirement, tired landlord)
- Poor EPC = must upgrade by 2025 (motivation signal)
- Simpler negotiation (direct to owner, not administrator)
- More properties likely (not limited to liquidation)

### Test 3: Class MA + Long Hold (Alternative)
```
Preset: "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
+ Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
+ Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
+ EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
Result: TBD
```

**Why:** Long hold + poor EPC = owner may want to exit

### Test 4: Class MA + Lease Expiry
```
Preset: "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
+ Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
+ Tenure: is one of [Leasehold]
Result: TBD
```

**Why:** Expiring lease = owner must sell or renegotiate

## 🚀 Action Plan: Next 48 Hours - UPDATED

### Priority 1: Export & Analyze D-4 Properties (3-4 hours) - DO THIS FIRST!

**Step 1: Export all 23 D-4 properties from SearchLand** (30-60 min)
- Get full addresses, owner names, property details
- **Note property sizes** (plot area, developed area) - THIS IS KEY!
- Note EPC ratings (F/G = priority, E = secondary)
- Note use classes (confirm Class MA eligible)
- Screenshot top 10 properties

**Step 2: Categorize D-4 by size** (1 hour)
Group by plot area:
- **Small** (<1 acre / <4,000 sqm): Priority 1 - BEST capital fit
- **Medium** (1-3 acres): Priority 2 - may need JV
- **Large** (>3 acres): Priority 3 - same as D-3

Create spreadsheet: Address | Owner | Plot area | Dev area | EPC | Use class | Location

**Step 3: Compare D-3 vs D-4** (30 min)
- D-3 average size: 2-8 acres (KNOWN)
- D-4 average size: Calculate from exports
- **KEY QUESTION:** Does D-4 have properties under 1 acre?

**If YES → D-4 becomes priority** (better capital fit)  
**If NO → Need to consider D-1/D-2** (lower profit, but fits budget)

**Step 4: Identify top 5-8 D-4 properties** (1 hour)
Filter for:
- Small size (<1 acre if possible)
- EPC F/G (highest motivation)
- Good location (Chelmsford, Brentwood = higher flat values)
- Existing buildings (easier conversion)

**Step 5: Quick profit estimates for top 5-8** (1 hour)
For each property:
- Estimate commercial value (comparables on Rightmove commercial)
- Apply 10-20% EPC discount
- Estimate conversion cost (£50k per flat × number of flats)
- Research residential comparables (Rightmove - flat prices in area)
- Calculate rough profit

### Priority 2: Run Alternative Class MA Tests (1 hour)

**Test all 4 variations above, document results:**

| Test | Filters | Result Count | Notes |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| D-3 (done) | Liquidation + Corporate | 8 | Already done |
| Test 2 | Private + Poor EPC | ? | Run now |
| Test 3 | Long hold + Poor EPC | ? | Run now |
| Test 4 | Lease expiry | ? | Run now |

**Goal:** Find which combination gives best properties (motivation + profit potential)

### Priority 3: Identify THE Winner (2 hours)

**After completing 1 & 2, create shortlist:**

Rank ALL properties (from D-3 + new tests) by:
1. **Profit potential** (£ amount)
2. **Capital fit** (closer to £200k = better)
3. **Motivation level** (liquidation > private distress > long hold)
4. **Execution simplicity** (smaller, fewer flats = faster)
5. **Location** (Chelmsford/Brentwood = higher values)

**Choose TOP 3 properties to pursue**

## 🎯 How to Identify "Absolutely a Winner"

### Criteria for Winner Property:

**1. Profit Must Exceed £150k** (non-negotiable)
- Class MA conversions: ✅ YES (typically £200k-£400k)
- HMO conversions: ❌ NO (typically £50k-£100k)

**2. Capital Must Be Achievable**
- Your £200k cash + bridging £100k-£150k = £300k-£350k total ✅
- OR JV partner provides additional capital ✅

**3. Motivation Must Be Strong**
- Liquidation: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (legal forced sale)
- Expired license: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (compliance pressure)
- Poor EPC + long hold: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (upgrade deadline)
- Just long hold: ⭐⭐ (soft signal - skip)

**4. Execution Must Be Feasible**
- Class MA allowed (no Article 4 Direction)
- Property size works (minimum 37.5 sqm per flat)
- Residential market strong (need buyers for flats)
- Administrator willing to sell (if liquidation)

**5. Numbers Must Stack Up**
```
Commercial value (normal): £X
Liquidation discount (35%): -35% = £Y
Your acquisition: £Y
Conversion cost: £50k × N flats = £Z
Total investment: £Y + £Z = £Total

Exit (flats): N × £240k = £GDV
Profit: £GDV - £Total - £20k (costs)

IF Profit > £150k → WINNER ✅
IF Profit < £150k → Keep looking ❌
```

## 🏅 Example "Winner" Property

**Hypothetical: 107 Baddow Road, Chelmsford**

**Why it's a winner:**

✅ **Motivation:** Company in liquidation (verified on Companies House)  
✅ **Administrator:** Wants quick sale (called and confirmed)  
✅ **Size:** 2,200 sqft = 204 sqm (enough for 4-5 flats)  
✅ **Use class:** E (Commercial) - eligible for Class MA  
✅ **Constraints:** No Article 4, no conservation area  
✅ **Location:** Chelmsford (strong residential market, £250k/flat)

**Numbers:**
- Commercial value: £280k
- Liquidation offer: £180k (36% discount - administrator accepts)
- Conversion: 4 flats × £50k = £200k
- Total: £380k

**Financing:**
- Your cash: £200k
- Bridging loan: £180k (6 months)
- Total: £380k ✅

**Exit:**
- 4 flats × £250k = £1,000k
- Costs: -£20k
- Net: £980k
- **Profit: £600k** 🏆

**Even if conservative (flats worth £220k):**
- 4 × £220k = £880k
- **Profit: £500k** ✅ STILL EXCEEDS TARGET

**Timeline:**
- Acquisition: 4 weeks
- Conversion: 6 months
- Sales: 3 months
- Total: 10 months

**THIS IS A WINNER** ✅

## ⚠️ Red Flags to Avoid

**Skip properties with:**
- ❌ Article 4 Direction (blocks Class MA)
- ❌ Conservation Area (blocks Class MA)
- ❌ Too small (<120 sqm / 1,300 sqft) - can't fit enough flats
- ❌ Too large (>500 sqm) - over budget for conversion
- ❌ Weak residential market (flats worth <£200k)
- ❌ Company NOT in liquidation (no discount)
- ❌ Complex ownership (multiple owners, disputes)
- ❌ Contaminated land (industrial history)
- ❌ Structural issues (would cost £50k+ to fix)

## 📋 Decision Tree

```
START: Do you have a property?
  ↓
Is it Class MA eligible? → NO → Skip, find another
  ↓ YES
Is company in liquidation/distress? → NO → Can you get 30% discount? 
  ↓ YES                                      ↓ NO → Skip
Is property 120-350 sqm? → NO → Too small/large → Skip
  ↓ YES
No Article 4 / Conservation Area? → NO → Skip (can't do Class MA)
  ↓ YES
Can fit 3-5 flats (37.5 sqm each)? → NO → Skip
  ↓ YES
Residential market strong (£220k+ per flat)? → NO → Skip
  ↓ YES
Can you finance £300k-£500k total? → NO → Find JV partner OR smaller property
  ↓ YES
Calculate profit: (N flats × £240k) - (acquisition + conversion + costs)
  ↓
Profit > £150k? → NO → Skip
  ↓ YES
✅ THIS IS A WINNER - MAKE OFFER!
```
