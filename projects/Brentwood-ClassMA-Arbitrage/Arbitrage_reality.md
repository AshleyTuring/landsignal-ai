Investment Research Report: Strategic Arbitrage Analysis of Site 128 (Land Adjoining 14-20, Croydon CR0 8XY)1. Executive Summary1.1 The Investment OpportunityThis report presents an exhaustive due diligence and investment arbitrage analysis of Site 128, formally identified as Land Adjoining 14-20, Croydon CR0 8XY (and historically referred to as Land at Poppy Lane). The site comprises approximately 3.53 acres (1.43 hectares) of greenfield land situated in the Shirley ward of the London Borough of Croydon. The core investment thesis posits that the site is currently undervalued due to its historical designation as Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and severe access constraints, but holds significant latent value contingent upon its reallocation for 123 residential units in the emerging Croydon Local Plan 2024 and the resolution of a critical "ransom strip" scenario regarding its access via Poppy Lane.1The arbitrage opportunity is defined by the valuation spread between its current status as restricted open land—valued nominally for grazing or amenity uses—and its potential future status as a consented, high-density residential development site in a supply-constrained London borough. The site is currently being promoted by Regent Land and Development Ltd, who have secured a proposed allocation in the submission version of the Local Plan.4 However, the realisation of this value is obstructed by a binary risk profile: the legal and physical capability to access the site via a private road that is not currently adoptable public highway.1.2 Key Findings and Risk ProfileThe investigation has synthesized data from planning policy documents, historical application records, resident association archives, and market data to establish the following critical findings:FeatureAnalysisImplications for ArbitragePlanning StatusStrong Positive. The site is allocated for 123 homes in the Croydon Local Plan Review (Submission Nov 2024). The Council has proactively de-designated the land from MOL, arguing it no longer serves the purpose of openness due to severance by the Shirley Oaks Hospital.3The policy wind is behind the development. The "hope value" is rapidly converting to "allocated value," reducing planning risk significantly, subject to the Plan's adoption in 2026.6Access & LegalCritical Negative (Red Flag). Access relies on Poppy Lane, a private road. The Council's 5-Year Housing Land Supply report explicitly notes a "delay regarding securing access".1 This indicates a classic "ransom strip" scenario where the road owner or residents' association can block development or demand 30-50% of the value uplift.This is the primary barrier to entry. Without a binding option agreement or easement over Poppy Lane, the land is effectively landlocked for high-density delivery. The arbitrage is impossible without securing this access first.Density & CapacityAggressive. The capacity has jumped from 91 units (2022) to 123 units (2024).3 This utilizes a "Cookie Cutter" density methodology based on urban typologies.7Higher density increases Gross Development Value (GDV) but heightens technical delivery risk (overlooking, traffic impact) and intensifies local opposition from the sophisticated Monks Orchard Residents' Association (MORA).Physical SiteConstrained. The site acts as a "green chain" link and contains significant mature vegetation protected by TPOs. It was omitted from the Level 2 Strategic Flood Risk Assessment, creating a potential procedural vulnerability during the Examination in Public.8High abatement costs for ecology (Biodiversity Net Gain), drainage (SuDS), and road widening will depress the Residual Land Value (RLV).1.3 Strategic VerdictSite 128 represents a high-risk, high-reward strategic land play. It is not a "plug-and-play" development opportunity. The arbitrage value lies almost entirely in the negotiation of access rights rather than the planning gain, which is already largely priced into the allocation.For an investor, the recommendation is to avoid direct land acquisition unless it is conditional on the vendor (Regent Land) delivering a secured, legally binding access agreement with the Poppy Lane owners. If access remains unresolved, the asset is a distressed hold with negligible resale value for development. The successful arbitrageur must effectively act as a diplomat between the aggressive housing targets of Croydon Council and the defensive legal rights of the private road owners.2. Introduction: The Anatomy of the Arbitrage2.1 Defining the Asset ClassIn the context of London real estate, "strategic land arbitrage" involves acquiring sites that are legally or policy-encumbered at a discount, and then expending capital and expertise to remove those encumbrances. Site 128 is a prime example of this asset class. It is "Green Belt" in all but name (MOL), located in an Outer London suburb (Shirley) that is traditionally resistant to densification, yet it is being forced through the planning pipeline by a local authority desperate to meet London Plan housing targets of 20,790 homes over ten years.10The specific arbitrage here is the De-designation Uplift.MOL Value: ~£25,000 - £50,000 per acre (Amenity/Grazing).Residential Value: ~£1.5m - £2.5m per acre (Consented Residential).11The Multiplier: On 3.53 acres, the gross uplift potential exceeds £6 million, providing a substantial margin to absorb planning costs and ransom payments—provided the ransom does not exceed the standard Stokes v Cambridge benchmark (one-third of uplift).2.2 Site Location and DescriptionThe site is an irregular parcel of land situated behind the residential frontages of Primrose Lane and Shirley Oaks Road.Postal Address: Land Adjoining 14-20, Croydon CR0 8XY.Access Point: Poppy Lane, a cul-de-sac spur off Primrose Lane.Surroundings: To the north lies the Shirley Oaks Hospital (a key landmark used to justify de-designation); to the east and west are remnants of Metropolitan Open Land; to the south is suburban housing.Physical Character: The site is described in planning documents as a "cleared site" but is noted by residents and opposition groups to contain "significant mature vegetation" and act as a wildlife corridor.3 It was historically associated with Shirley Oaks children's home and later auctioned to private speculators.92.3 The Stakeholder MapUnderstanding the players is crucial for assessing the viability of the arbitrage.The Promoter: Regent Land and Development Ltd. A focused strategic land developer with a track record in Croydon (e.g., Matthews Yard redevelopment, Whytecliffe Road). Their involvement signals commercial intent and professional capability.4The Local Authority: London Borough of Croydon (LBC). A council under significant financial and housing delivery pressure, currently in "special measures" (Improvement and Assurance Panel). They are the "ally" in this arbitrage, actively pushing the site's allocation despite local opposition.15The Opposition: Monks Orchard Residents' Association (MORA). A highly organized, articulate, and diligent residents' group. They have tracked this site for over 15 years, possess detailed knowledge of its legal constraints, and actively participate in the Examination in Public (EiP) process.3The Landowner: Historically identified as a Mr. Hyatt (purchased circa 2010), who cleared the site of trees to prevent TPOs from blocking future development.9 The current ownership likely involves an option agreement with Regent Land.3. Planning Policy Framework: The Engine of ValueThe "engine" driving the value uplift of Site 128 is the Croydon Local Plan Review 2024. Without this policy vehicle, the site remains valueless MOL. This section analyses the mechanics of the de-designation and the robustness of the allocation.3.1 The Housing Target PressureCroydon is subject to aggressive housing targets set by the Greater London Authority (GLA). The London Plan 2021 sets a 10-year target of 20,790 new homes (2,079 per annum).1Supply Shortfall: The Council’s 5-Year Housing Land Supply (2022/23) indicates a supply of 11,893 units against a target of 11,200, nominally a 5.3-year supply.1 However, this "surplus" is fragile and relies heavily on strategic allocations like Site 128 coming forward.Consequence: The Council cannot afford to lose sites from the allocation list. If Site 128 falls out of the plan during the Examination, the 5-year supply could dip below 5 years, triggering the "Presumption in Favour of Sustainable Development" (NPPF Para 11), which essentially removes local control over planning. This incentivizes the Council to support the developer in overcoming obstacles.3.2 The De-designation of Metropolitan Open Land (MOL)The most controversial aspect of the arbitrage is the removal of MOL status. MOL is protected by Policy G3 of the London Plan, which states that de-designation should only occur in "exceptional circumstances."The Council's Case: The Council argues that Site 128 (along with land south of Shirley Oaks Hospital) no longer serves the purposes of MOL because it is "separated from the wider open area made up of Ashburton Playing Fields... by Shirley Oaks Hospital and its car park".5 They argue it is physically contained and does not contribute to the strategic openness of London’s green network.The Counter-Argument: MORA and the CPRE argue this assessment is factually incorrect. They contend that the site is part of a "green chain" and wildlife corridor that links to adjacent open spaces. They argue the physical barrier (the fence) is broken and the ecological connectivity remains.12Risk Assessment: The Planning Inspector at the Examination in Public (EiP) will adjudicate this. If the Inspector agrees with CPRE that the "exceptional circumstances" test hasn't been met, the allocation will be struck out, and the site value will revert to zero. However, given the desperate need for housing land, Inspectors often side with Councils on "boundary tweaks" if the strategic function of the Green Belt/MOL is largely compromised by existing urban development (like the hospital).3.3 Density Policy: The "Cookie Cutter" MethodologyThe proposed capacity of 123 homes represents a density of approximately 86 units per hectare (123 units / 1.43 ha). This is a significant intensification from the 91 units proposed in 2022.Methodology: The Council used a "Cookie Cutter" approach 7, where they overlay theoretical building typologies (e.g., "Urban Residential" blocks like Scarbrook House) onto site maps to calculate capacity.Implication: This methodology is abstract and often ignores site-specific constraints like topography, root protection areas of TPO trees, and access road width.Arbitrage Reality Check: While the allocated capacity is 123 units, the deliverable capacity is likely lower. MORA’s analysis suggests the site density for an "Outer Suburban" setting should be closer to 20-40 units per hectare, which would yield only ~40-50 units.3 An investor should model the GDV based on a conservative 80-90 units, not the optimistic 123. If the price paid for the land assumes 123 units, the developer risks overpaying.4. The Access Constraint: A Deep Dive into the "Ransom Strip"The planning policy provides the potential for value, but the access constraint determines the ability to realize it. This is the single most critical failure point for the arbitrage.4.1 Legal Status of Poppy LanePoppy Lane is unequivocally a Private Road. It is not a highway maintainable at public expense.2Ownership: Private roads in the UK are typically owned ad medium filum (to the middle line) by the frontagers, or the subsoil is retained by the original developer/estate. In the case of Shirley, many private roads are managed by companies or residents' associations (e.g., Croydon Road Residents Association, though specific ownership of Poppy Lane needs title verification).19Usage Rights: Existing rights of way over Poppy Lane are likely limited to the current use (grazing/amenity or a single dwelling). Intensification of use to serve 123 dwellings (generating ~600+ vehicle movements per day) falls outside the scope of existing easements.The "Delay": The Council’s 5-Year Land Supply Report (March 2023) states: "Developer has been in discussion with the Council, there has been a delay regarding securing access to the site, but this is expected to be resolved shortly".1 The persistence of this note into the 2024 submission period indicates the dispute is entrenched.4.2 The Ransom Strip MechanicsIn Stokes v Cambridge Corporation (1961), the court established that the owner of a strip of land essential for accessing a development site is entitled to a share of the development value.Valuation Principle: The "Stokes Percentage" is typically one-third (33%) of the uplift in value unlocked by the access.Calculus:Value without access: £100,000 (MOL grazing land).Value with access (123 units): £8,000,000 (Residential land).Uplift: £7,900,000.Ransom Payment: ~£2.6 million.The Problem: If there are multiple owners (e.g., multiple frontagers on Poppy Lane needing to grant consent), the negotiation becomes exponentially complex. If even one owner refuses on principle (common with resident associations like MORA who oppose development), the scheme is dead. The Council is unlikely to use Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPO) for a private housing scheme in the current political climate, as indicated by the Mayor’s stance on protecting green spaces.204.3 Highway Standards and AdoptionTo service 123 homes, Poppy Lane would need to be brought up to adoptable standards (Section 38 Agreement).Requirements: This involves widening to at least 5.5m (plus footways), installing street lighting, and surface water drainage.21Physical Constraint: Research suggests Poppy Lane is narrow. If the physical width between existing boundary fences/trees does not allow for a 5.5m carriageway plus 2m footways, the site cannot legally service 123 homes. The GLA previously criticized the "width of footpaths around the site" in the 2008 application, citing insufficient detail.2 This suggests physical width is a hard constraint.5. Site Anatomy and Technical ConstraintsThe physical characteristics of Site 128 impose further costs (abnormals) that must be deducted from the land value.5.1 Ecology and TPOsThe site is ecologically sensitive.Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs): The site is covered by an Area TPO served in 2000, and individual orders on mature oak and horse chestnut trees.9Impact: Root Protection Areas (RPAs) for mature oaks can extend 12-15m from the trunk. Construction is prohibited within RPAs. This significantly reduces the net developable area.Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG): The Environment Act 2021 mandates a 10% net gain in biodiversity. Converting a greenfield site (even a scrubby one) to housing creates a massive biodiversity deficit. The developer will likely need to buy off-site credits or devote a large portion of the site (e.g., 30%) to open space, further reducing the unit count from 123 to perhaps 80.5.2 Flood RiskThe site was omitted from the Council's Level 2 SFRA.8Surface Water: Croydon has a high risk of surface water flooding due to urbanization and clay soils. The snippets highlight that "School buildings and residential development should be located away from areas at risk from surface water ponding".22Drainage Strategy: The site will require large attenuation tanks (underground crates) to manage runoff. This is expensive civil engineering work (~£200k-£300k) and limits the ability to plant trees or build over those areas.5.3 Archaeology and HeritageWhile not in a Conservation Area, the site is near the Shirley Oaks institution. Snippets mention the need for "Heritage Statements" for applications affecting significance.4 While a minor risk compared to access, it adds to the cumulative cost of the planning application.6. Market Analysis: Pricing the OpportunityTo quantify the arbitrage, we must establish the Gross Development Value (GDV) and the Residual Land Value (RLV).6.1 Residential Market Values in Shirley (CR0 7/8)Shirley is a distinct market from central Croydon. It is suburban, dominated by semi-detached houses and bungalows, with a premium for "leafy" streets.House Prices (2024/25):Detached: £650k - £850k.23Semi-Detached: £500k - £600k.24Terraced/Small Houses: £450k - £500k.New Build Flats: Values are lower, typically £300k - £350k for 1-2 beds.25 The market for flats in Shirley is thinner than for houses; families move here for gardens.Arbitrage Implication: A scheme of 123 units on 1.43ha implies a dominance of flats (3-4 storeys). Selling 123 flats in a suburban house market carries sales risk. The demand is for houses, but the density target forces flats. This misalignment risks calculating a GDV that the market cannot absorb at speed.6.2 Development CostsBase Build Cost: ~£2,400 per sqm (BCIS Outer London Estate Housing).Abnormals:Road adoption/upgrades: £500k+SuDS/Drainage: £250kEcology/BNG: £150kCIL & S106:Mayoral CIL: ~£25/sqm.Croydon CIL: Residential rates in Zone B are indexed annually.S106: Obligations for health and education will be roughly £1,500 - £2,000 per unit.Affordable Housing: Croydon Local Plan Policy SP2 requires 50% affordable housing.15 However, the snippets note that viability studies show 50% is "challenging".4 A more realistic negotiated settlement is 35%, split between Affordable Rent and Shared Ownership. This significantly dilutes the blended GDV.6.3 Residual Land Value (RLV) ModelGDV (123 units): £49.2m (avg £400k/unit).Costs (incl Profit): ~£38m.RLV (Pre-Ransom): ~£11m.Ransom Deduction (33%): -£3.6m.Net Land Value: £7.4m.Existing Use Value (MOL): £100k.The Arbitrage Spread: £7.3m.Caveat: This assumes the "Access Delay" is purely financial. If the road owners simply refuse to sell at any price, the RLV is £0.7. Developer Profile: Regent Land and DevelopmentAn analysis of the current promoter provides insight into the likelihood of success.7.1 Company ProfileRegent Land and Development Ltd is a specialist brownfield and strategic land developer.Strategy: They focus on "unconditional" purchases or option agreements on difficult sites, using planning expertise to unlock value.Relevant Projects:5-9 Surrey Street, Croydon: A complex mixed-use scheme involving demolition and new build in a conservation area. They successfully negotiated 34% affordable housing (down from 50%).26 This demonstrates their ability to negotiate viability with Croydon Council.Whytecliffe Road, Purley: A 49-unit scheme.Implication: They are competent and experienced in Croydon. If they are struggling to unlock the access ("delay" noted in 2023), it suggests the obstacle is formidable, not due to developer incompetence.7.2 The PartnershipRegent Land actively supports the allocation in the Local Plan consultation.4 Their continued spending on planning promotion suggests they believe a solution is possible, potentially via a prescriptive easement strategy or a high-value offer to road owners.8. Strategic Risks and Mitigation8.1 Planning Adoption RiskRisk: The Inspector deletes Site 128 from the plan due to CPRE/MORA objections regarding MOL status.Mitigation: The "Housing Delivery Test" failure puts the Council in a weak position. They need this site. The Inspector is likely to retain it if the "Exceptional Circumstances" (housing need) are well-argued.Probability: Low-Medium.8.2 The "Binary" Access RiskRisk: Poppy Lane residents/owners refuse access permanently.Mitigation: There is no mitigation for total refusal other than CPO, which is unlikely. The only path is financial negotiation.Probability: High. This is the "widow-maker" risk of the deal.8.3 Community Opposition RiskRisk: MORA launches a Judicial Review (JR) against the de-designation or the planning consent.Mitigation: Ensure the planning process is procedurally watertight (EIA, consultation). Offer "planning gain" to the community, such as a localized nature park or funding for the replacement community centre mentioned in the snippets.27Probability: Medium-High.9. Conclusion and Investment Verdict9.1 The Arbitrage VerdictSite 128 is a classic distressed strategic asset. The arbitrage spread of ~£7m is attractive on paper, but it effectively represents a litigation and negotiation premium. The value is not in the bricks and mortar; it is in the legal ability to cross a 100-meter strip of private tarmac.9.2 RecommendationFor a Passive Investor: AVOID. The binary risk of the access constraint makes this unsuitable for capital that requires defined exit timelines. The "delay" cited by the Council is a warning sign that the access dispute is non-trivial.For a Specialist Strategic Land Fund: PROCEED WITH CAUTION.Entry Price: Do not pay more than "Hope Value" (e.g., £500k-£1m). Do not pay "Residential Land Value" until access is secured.Structure: Enter an Option Agreement with the current landowner (Hyatt/Regent) conditional on (a) Local Plan Adoption and (b) Securing a Deed of Easement for Poppy Lane.The Key Maneuver: The primary workstream should not be architectural design, but title investigation and negotiation with the Poppy Lane frontagers. If the road can be bought or an easement secured for <£2m, the arbitrage is viable.9.3 Final Summary DataMetricValue/StatusSite ReferenceSite 128 (Croydon Local Plan)Area1.43 Hectares (3.53 Acres)Allocation123 Units (Residential)Current StatusSubmission Draft (Reg 22) - Nov 2024Adoption TargetSpring 2026Primary ConstraintPrivate Road Access (Ransom Strip)Est.
