# Why Plot Size Matters for Class MA Conversions

**Date:** 2024-12-04  
**Question:** "What do you mean by too small? Perhaps we should look for the right size in the filters?"

**Answer:** You're ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Let me explain the math and show why we should filter by size.

---

## 📐 The Math Behind Minimum Viable Size

### Class MA Legal Requirements:

**Minimum flat size under Permitted Development:**
- **37.5 sqm per flat** (403 sqft) - this is the LAW
- Cannot go smaller or planning permission gets rejected
- Source: Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015

**Typical market-viable flat size:**
- **1-bed:** 50-60 sqm (538-646 sqft)
- **2-bed:** 70-80 sqm (753-861 sqft)
- These sizes achieve £220k-£250k market value
- Smaller flats = lower market value = less profit

### Why 37.5 sqm Matters:

**Space requirements for a flat:**
- Living room: 15 sqm
- Bedroom: 10 sqm
- Kitchen: 5 sqm
- Bathroom: 4 sqm
- Hallway/storage: 3.5 sqm
- **Total: 37.5 sqm minimum**

**Can't fit a flat in less space without breaking regulations**

## 🏢 How Plot Size Affects Number of Flats

### The "Usable Space" Calculation:

**Plot area ≠ Flat area**

You lose space to:
- Building footprint (walls, structure)
- Parking spaces (planning requirement)
- Access roads/paths
- Common areas (stairs, hallways)
- Outdoor space requirements
- Utilities (boilers, meters)

**Rule of thumb:** 40-50% of plot area is lost to non-flat space

### Examples:

#### Tiny Plot: 0.05 acres (202 sqm)
- **Plot area:** 202 sqm
- **Minus 50% (non-flat space):** -101 sqm
- **Usable for flats:** 101 sqm
- **÷ 50 sqm per flat:** **2 flats maximum**

#### Small Plot: 0.3 acres (1,214 sqm)
- **Plot area:** 1,214 sqm
- **Minus 45% (non-flat space):** -546 sqm
- **Usable for flats:** 668 sqm
- **÷ 50 sqm per flat:** **13 flats** (but realistically 3-4 for good layout)

#### Medium Plot: 0.7 acres (2,833 sqm)
- **Plot area:** 2,833 sqm
- **Minus 40% (non-flat space):** -1,133 sqm
- **Usable for flats:** 1,700 sqm
- **÷ 50 sqm per flat:** **34 flats** (but realistically 5-8 for good layout)

#### Large Plot: 1.5 acres (6,070 sqm)
- **Plot area:** 6,070 sqm
- **Minus 40% (non-flat space):** -2,428 sqm
- **Usable for flats:** 3,642 sqm
- **÷ 50 sqm per flat:** **73 flats** (but realistically 10-15 for good layout)

## 💰 Profit Analysis by Size

### Tiny Property: 0.05 acres (2 flats max)

**Assumptions:**
- Retail shop or small office
- Purchase: £150k-£200k (retail space is expensive per sqm)
- Conversion: £70k per flat × 2 = £140k (small spaces are harder/more expensive to convert)
- **Total cost:** £290k-£340k

**Sale:**
- 2 flats × £220k (small flats sell for less) = £440k
- Sale costs: -£10k
- **Net: £430k**

**Profit:** £430k - £340k = **£90k-£140k**

**Result:** ⚠️ BORDERLINE - May not hit £150k target, high risk

---

### Small Property: 0.3 acres (3-4 flats)

**Assumptions:**
- Small commercial unit
- Purchase: £200k-£250k
- Conversion: £55k per flat × 3.5 = £193k
- **Total cost:** £393k-£443k

**Sale:**
- 3.5 flats × £230k = £805k
- Sale costs: -£15k
- **Net: £790k**

**Profit:** £790k - £443k = **£347k-£397k**

**Result:** ✅ GOOD - Exceeds £150k target, decent return

---

### Medium Property: 0.7 acres (5-7 flats)

**Assumptions:**
- Industrial/commercial building
- Purchase: £300k-£400k
- Conversion: £50k per flat × 6 = £300k
- **Total cost:** £600k-£700k

**Sale:**
- 6 flats × £240k = £1.44M
- Sale costs: -£25k
- **Net: £1.415M**

**Profit:** £1.415M - £700k = **£715k-£815k**

**Result:** 🔥 EXCELLENT - Massive profit, scales well

---

### Large Property: 1.5 acres (10-12 flats)

**Assumptions:**
- Large industrial/warehouse
- Purchase: £600k-£800k
- Conversion: £45k per flat × 11 = £495k
- **Total cost:** £1.095M-£1.295M

**Sale:**
- 11 flats × £245k = £2.695M
- Sale costs: -£50k
- **Net: £2.645M**

**Profit:** £2.645M - £1.295M = **£1.35M-£1.55M**

**Result:** 🚀 MASSIVE - But needs £1M+ capital (JV required)

---

## 🎯 The "Sweet Spot" for Your £200k Budget

### Your Capital Situation:
- **Cash available:** £200k
- **Bridging finance potential:** £100k-£300k (6-12 months)
- **Total capital:** £300k-£500k

### Sweet Spot: 0.6-1.2 acres (2,400-4,800 sqm)

**Why this range:**
1. **Fits 4-8 flats** (optimal profit per capital deployed)
2. **Total cost: £400k-£700k** (your £200k + £200k-£500k bridge)
3. **Profit: £500k-£900k** (excellent ROI)
4. **Manageable size** (not too complex, reasonable timeline)

**Properties under 0.5 acres:**
- Can only fit 2-3 flats
- Profit too low (£100k-£200k)
- Not worth the effort/risk

**Properties over 1.5 acres:**
- Need £1M+ capital (way over budget)
- Require JV partner
- More complex (planning, builders, timelines)

## 🔍 Why D-4 Results Were Mostly "Too Small"

### What We Got (No Size Filter):

**The 23 D-4 properties were:**
- 15-16 properties under 0.3 acres (65-70%)
- 6-7 properties 0.3-0.5 acres (26-30%)
- 1 property over 0.5 acres (4%)

**Types of properties found:**
- Retail shops (Chinese takeaway, bakery, convenience store)
- Small offices (single storey, 100-300 sqm)
- Tiny commercial units (hairdressers, estate agents)
- Former pubs/restaurants

**Why these don't work:**
1. **Can only fit 1-2 flats** (not enough to hit £150k profit)
2. **Awkward layouts** (shop fronts, large ground floor, not suitable for flats)
3. **High conversion cost** (small spaces are fiddly and expensive)
4. **High purchase price per sqm** (retail space costs more than industrial)
5. **Planning risks** (retail to residential can face objections)

---

## ✅ YOUR SOLUTION: Filter by Minimum Plot Size

### Recommended Filter: Add Plot Area Minimum

**Current D-4 filter:**
```
"Class MA sites filtered for potential profit"
+ Tenure: Freehold
+ Ownership type: Private owner
+ EPC rating: E, F, G
```

**REVISED D-4 filter (ADD THIS):**
```
"Class MA sites filtered for potential profit"
+ Tenure: Freehold
+ Ownership type: Private owner
+ EPC rating: E, F, G
+ Plot area (sqm): is greater than 2400  ← ADD THIS LINE
```

**Why 2,400 sqm (0.59 acres)?**
- Fits 4-6 flats comfortably
- Eliminates 90% of retail shops and tiny offices
- Focuses on actual commercial/industrial buildings
- Sweet spot for your £200k + bridging capital

**Alternative thresholds:**
- **Conservative:** 3,000 sqm (0.74 acres) - very safe, 5-8 flats
- **Moderate:** 2,400 sqm (0.59 acres) - good balance, 4-6 flats
- **Aggressive:** 2,000 sqm (0.49 acres) - includes more options, 3-5 flats

---

## 🚀 What This Filter Will Do

### Expected Results with Plot Area > 2,400 sqm:

**From 23 properties → Probably 3-8 properties**

**You'll get:**
- Small industrial units (0.6-1.2 acres)
- Former warehouses (0.7-1.5 acres)
- Business parks (0.8-2.0 acres)
- Commercial yards (0.6-1.0 acres)

**You'll eliminate:**
- Retail shops (0.03-0.2 acres) ❌
- Small offices (0.05-0.3 acres) ❌
- Tiny commercial units (0.04-0.15 acres) ❌
- Former pubs (0.08-0.25 acres) ❌

**Result:** Only properties that can generate £150k-£1M profit ✅

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Step 1: Rerun D-4 with Size Filter (5 minutes)

**Filter to use:**
```
"Class MA sites filtered for potential profit"
+ Tenure: Freehold
+ Ownership type: Private owner
+ EPC rating: E, F, G
+ Plot area (sqm): is greater than 2400
```

**Export results** and send me:
- Number of properties found
- Screenshots of top 5-8
- Property addresses and plot sizes

### Step 2: Analyze Results (30 minutes)

I'll quickly analyze:
- Which properties are in sweet spot (0.6-1.2 acres)
- Which have best locations (Chelmsford, Brentwood, Loughton)
- Which have worst EPCs (F/G = most motivated)
- Top 3-5 targets for pursuit

### Step 3: Compare All Approaches (15 minutes)

**Then we'll decide:**
- D-4-REVISED (filtered): Best standalone properties?
- D-3 (liquidations): Worth finding JV partner?
- D-1/D-2 (HMOs): Lower profit but fits budget solo?

### Step 4: Execute (Next week)

**Focus on top 3 properties across all approaches**
- Research owners/companies
- Financial modeling
- Prepare outreach
- Make offers

## 💡 Bottom Line

**You asked: "Perhaps we should look for the right size in the filters?"**

**Answer:** YES! 100% correct! 🎯

**The problem with D-4 wasn't the CONCEPT** (Class MA + Private + EPC)  
**The problem was NO SIZE FILTER** (got 23 tiny shops/offices)

**Solution:** Add `Plot area (sqm): is greater than 2400`

**Expected outcome:**
- 3-8 properly sized properties (0.6-1.5 acres)
- ALL capable of £200k-£1M profit
- ALL worth your time analyzing
- One of these could be THE winner ✅
