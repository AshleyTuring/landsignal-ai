# CRITICAL: Strategy A Problem Analysis

**Date:** 2024-12-04  
**Issue:** "Companies owning 30+ titles" preset returns WRONG type of owners

---

## ❌ What We Expected

**Strategy A Assumption:**
- Find portfolio landlords with 30+ HMO titles
- These are operators running multiple HMOs
- They might want to sell 2-3 HMOs as bulk package
- We could negotiate bulk discount

**Expected Profile:**
- Small-medium property company
- Actively managing HMOs
- Potential exit strategy (retire, cash out, focus on other investments)
- Motivated by: compliance costs, EPC upgrades, portfolio rationalization

---

## ❌ What We Actually Got

### Properties 1-3 of 11 Analysis:

**Property 1: 19 Rodells, Chivelhampton, Basildon**
- **Freehold Owner:** GATEHOUSE BANK PLC (06240053)
- **Leasehold Owner (HMO operator):** Amjam Properties 1 Ltd
- **HMO:** Yes (6 households)

**Property 2: 125 Roodegate, Basildon**
- **Freehold Owner:** GATEHOUSE BANK PLC (06240053)
- **Leasehold Owner (HMO operator):** Amjam Properties 1 Ltd
- **HMO:** Yes (6 households)

**Property 3:** (Same pattern)

### The Problem:

**GATEHOUSE BANK PLC owns the FREEHOLDS, not the HMO businesses**

**What this means:**
- Gatehouse Bank is a major **Islamic investment bank** in London
- They own 30+ freehold titles as **ground rent investments**
- They collect ground rent from leaseholders
- They do NOT operate the HMOs
- **The actual HMO operator is "Amjam Properties 1 Ltd" (the leaseholder)**

---

## Why This Doesn't Work

### 1. Banks Don't Sell Individual Freeholds
- Gatehouse Bank holds these as **long-term investment portfolio**
- Ground rent = passive income stream
- They have ZERO motivation to sell individual properties
- Even if they did, they'd want market value (no discount)

### 2. You Can't Operate the HMO by Buying the Freehold
- The HMO business is run by the LEASEHOLDER (Amjam Properties)
- If you buy the freehold from Gatehouse, you become the landlord TO Amjam
- You collect ground rent, but Amjam still operates the HMO
- You DON'T get the HMO rental income

### 3. Wrong Purchase Target
- **What we wanted:** Buy the HMO business (with tenants, licenses, rental income)
- **What this offers:** Buy the freehold (become ground rent collector, no HMO operation)

### 4. No Profit Path
- **If you buy freehold:** You get £200-£500/year ground rent (NOT £2,000/month HMO rent)
- **Cost:** Probably £150k-£200k for freehold
- **Return:** £500/year = 0.25% yield (TERRIBLE)
- **To make money:** You'd need to wait for lease to expire (could be 90+ years)

## What the Preset Actually Returns

**"Companies owning more than 30 titles" finds:**

1. **Investment Banks** (like Gatehouse Bank)
   - Own freeholds for ground rent income
   - NOT motivated to sell
   - NOT HMO operators

2. **Ground Rent Investment Funds**
   - Specialize in buying freeholds for passive income
   - Hold for decades
   - NOT motivated to sell individuals

3. **Housing Associations / Councils**
   - Social housing providers
   - NOT selling

4. **MAYBE some portfolio landlords** (if lucky)
   - But these would be mixed in with banks/funds
   - Hard to identify

---

## The Real Opportunity (If Any)

**The actual HMO operator is "Amjam Properties 1 Ltd"**

**Questions to investigate:**
1. How many HMOs does Amjam Properties operate? (might be 30+)
2. Do they OWN any freeholds, or all leasehold?
3. Are THEY motivated to sell their leasehold interests?

**But even this is problematic:**
- Buying a LEASEHOLD HMO is different from freehold
- You have ground rent + service charges to pay
- You have lease terms to comply with
- Less control over the property
- Harder to refinance (lenders prefer freehold)

## Verdict on Strategy A

### ❌ STRATEGY A IS NOT VIABLE AS DESIGNED

**Why:**
1. Returns institutional investors (banks, funds) not portfolio landlords
2. These owners have no motivation to sell individual properties
3. Even if they sold, you'd buy freehold not HMO business
4. No profit path for £150k target

**Pivot Options:**

**Option A1: Investigate the LEASEHOLDERS instead**
- Research "Amjam Properties 1 Ltd"
- Find out if they own/operate other HMOs
- Approach THEM about buying leasehold interests
- ⚠️ But leasehold HMOs are less desirable

**Option A2: Abandon Strategy A entirely**
- Focus on Strategy B (Expired licenses - 6 properties)
- Focus on Strategy C (Homes to HMO systematic narrowing)
- These target actual property owners, not banks

---

## Recommended Action: ABANDON STRATEGY A

**Reasons:**
1. Wrong target (banks not landlords)
2. No profit mechanism
3. Would need to investigate each of 11 results to find actual operators
4. Time-consuming with low probability of success

**Better use of time:**
- Double down on Strategy B (6 expired licenses)
- Execute Strategy C (systematic narrowing of 66,138)
- Run Strategy D (HMO opportunities with corrected filters)

---

## Lesson Learned

**Filter Name:** "Companies owning more than 30 titles"

**What it ACTUALLY filters:**
- Companies that own the FREEHOLD title at Land Registry
- Includes banks, investment funds, ground rent collectors
- Does NOT distinguish between freeholder and HMO operator

**What we NEEDED:**
- Companies that OPERATE 30+ HMOs
- Companies with HMO licenses across multiple properties
- Actual landlords with rental income (not ground rent)

**Missing Filter:**
- "HMO License Holder Name: [search for companies with multiple]"
- "Number of HMOs operated by company: > 30"
- These filters don't exist in SearchLand

**❌ ABANDONED: Strategy A (Companies 30+ titles)**

- No viable profit path
- Waste of time

---

## Action Items

**STOP:**
- Don't spend more time on the 11 companies from Strategy A
- Don't research Gatehouse Bank or other institutional owners

**START:**
1. Run Strategy B (Expired licenses) immediately
2. Run Strategy C (Homes to HMO) systematic tests
3. Document which motivation filters work best
4. Focus on ACTUAL property owners with ACTUAL motivation

---

**Status:** Strategy A FAILED - Pivot to B & C  
**Time Saved:** 2-3 hours (by not researching 11 irrelevant companies)  
**Next Action:** Run Strategy B now (5 minutes)
