**Approach A: MA Freehold Micro-Conversions**

**Strategic Pattern:** 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles (Class MA arbitrage)  
**Capital Required:** £180k-£200k (cash + light works)  
**Expected Results:** ~25-60 titles (from 209 MA-eligible → narrowed by freehold/scale/height)

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local planning authority: is Brentwood
2. Preset: equals Class MA eligible commercial sites
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.03 AND less than 0.15
5. Max building height (m): is less than 8
6. Use class: contains any [E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)]
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 50
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2020
```

**Rationale:** Start from MA-eligible preset (209 results). Layer Pattern 23A by forcing zero leaseholds to avoid headlease negotiations. Small titles (<0.15 acres) + low rise (<8m) reduce capital outlay and structural risk for Class MA. Older sales pre-2020 bias toward legacy owners. Constraint screen keeps PD path clean.

**Strengths:**
- Zero-leasehold filter strips negotiation risk.
- Low-rise stock = cheaper structural compliance for MA.
- Small titles align with £200k entry + light capex.
- Legacy ownership increases motivation and pricing arbitrage.

**Limitations:**
- MA floor area cap (4,000 sqm) implicit; verify per site.
- May miss viable constrained-but-appealable assets.
- Older stock can hide fabric/MEP costs.
- Profit depends on resi GDV comps; need micro-comping.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Export results; triage by frontage/depth and servicing (rear access for bins/lightwells).
- Run quick-build cost check for shell+core to resi standard; flag anything with deep plan risk.
- Title review for restrictive covenants/user clauses; if brand covenants exist, plan for deed of variation.
- Offer structure: 5-10% deposit, 6-month exchange-completion to secure prior approval, assignable option if needed.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/contract deposit: £20k-£30k  
- Planning/PD prior approval + surveys (structural, acoustic, fire): £8k-£12k  
- Strip-out + light CAT A/CAT B enablement: £40k-£60k  
- Professional fees (legal, architect, MEP, building control): £20k-£25k  
- Contingency (10-12%): £15k-£20k  
- **Total:** £103k-£147k (leaves headroom to £200k for acquisition balance/SDLT as needed)


**Approach B: Large Low-EPC Houses to HMO (Brentwood)**

**Strategic Pattern:** 22A HMO Conversion (volume + regulation-driven motivation)  
**Capital Required:** £140k-£190k (purchase + conversion)  
**Expected Results:** ~30-70 titles (from 112 Run down homes → narrowed by size/Article 4)

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local planning authority: is Brentwood
2. Preset: equals Run down homes
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
4. Addresses: is equal to 1
5. Article 4 HMO: does not contain Article 4
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 60
7. Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2005
8. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Base preset (low EPC detached stock) gives forced-motivation via MEES compliance. Adding >2,000 sqft targets large envelopes for 6-bed HMO under £200k capital. Single-address ensures straightforward C3→Sui Generis/large C4 without leaseholder consent. Excluding Article 4 keeps permitted/probable path open. Legacy sale + no recent apps surfaces passive owners.

**Strengths:**
- Regulation pain (EPC E-G) + no Article 4 = high negotiation leverage.
- Large floor area supports 6-bed HMO with strong yield uplift (5-8% vs 3-4% BTL).
- Single-owner titles simplify deal and works.
- Passive ownership (no apps, old sale) reduces competitive tension.

**Limitations:**
- Conversion standards (fire/amenity) can erode margin if layouts are inefficient.
- Brentwood licensing nuances need early check (amenity space, parking).
- Older housing may need heavier MEP upgrades than budgeted.
- Fewer urban comparables for HMOs; need careful rent stress testing.

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Desk plan: test 6-bed layout with minimum room sizes and 1:3 bath ratio; confirm bin/bike storage.
- EPC uplift plan: insulate + heating system upgrade costed before offer.
- Validate parking/amenity against Brentwood HMO guidance; pre-app if marginal.
- Offer with short completion; include allowance for EPC/MEP works; line up refurb team for 8-12 week program.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Deposit (assume £250k purchase @25%): £62.5k  
- SDLT + legals + surveys: £12k-£15k  
- Conversion/MEP/fire upgrades: £45k-£70k  
- Professional fees (planning/licence if required, architect, building control): £8k-£12k  
- Contingency (10-12%): £10k-£15k  
- **Total:** £137.5k-£174.5k (within £200k cap)

Natural next steps: 1) Run both prompts to check actual counts; 2) Shortlist top 10 by frontage/depth/layout; 3) Desktop GDV and rent comps; 4) Engage on titles with clean ownership and quickest PD/HMO path.
