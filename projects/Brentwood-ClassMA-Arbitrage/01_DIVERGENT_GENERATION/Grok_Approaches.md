### Approach A: Class MA Commercial to Residential Conversion

**Strategic Pattern:** Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Pattern 8A: Permitted Development Rights)

**Capital Required:** £100,000-£200,000 per deal (acquisition + conversion costs)

**Expected Results:** 30-50 properties (refined from base preset of 44 sites)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(a) - Display or Retail sale of goods, E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E(c)(i) - Financial constants, E(c)(ii) - Professional constants, E(c)(iii) - Other commercial constants, E(d) - Indoor sport, E(e) - Provision of medical or health constants, E(f) - Creche, day nursery or day centre, E(g)(i) - Offices to carry out any operational or administrative functions, E(g)(ii) - Research and development of products or processes, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.5
4. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 50
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
6. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
```

**Rationale:**
This approach leverages the Class MA preset (#4) as a base, which targets commercial sites eligible for PDR conversion to residential (up to 2 flats per building). The preset shows 44 sites in Brentwood LPA, but refinements narrow to capital-feasible opportunities (0.05-0.5 acres for £200k budget) while excluding planning blockers. This exploits regulation-driven motivation where owners may not realize PDR rights, creating arbitrage. Based on FILTER_PATTERNS.md Pattern 8A and LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md insights on PDR routes, this targets quick conversions (6-12 months) with high profit margins from undervalued commercial assets.

**Strengths:**
- PDR route bypasses full planning (faster execution, lower risk)
- SearchLand calculates profit automatically in preset #4
- High volume of commercial sites in Brentwood (209 eligible per preset #32)
- Capital-efficient with proven conversions (Class MA = commercial to residential)

**Limitations:**
- Limited to Class E uses (2-year use requirement)
- Size restrictions (<4,000 sqmt title area)
- Some areas excluded (AONB, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area)
- Requires 2-year commercial use history

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Use refined filters to identify sites; review first 10-15 for viability (focus on ground-floor commercial with residential potential above).
2. Approach owners directly (off-market) with PDR explanation and offer £50k-£100k below market, contingent on PDR approval.
3. Secure option agreement (£10k-£20k deposit) for 6-12 months.
4. Apply for PDR prior approval (cost £5k-£10k); convert to 1-2 flats.
5. Sell completed units at £300k-£400k each for £150k+ profit per deal.
6. Volume strategy: Target 2-3 deals/year for £300k-£450k annual profit.

### Approach B: Infill Development Opportunities

**Strategic Pattern:** Capital-Efficient Structures (Pattern 4A: Low Capital Entry)

**Capital Required:** £50,000-£150,000 per deal (site acquisition + minimal build)

**Expected Results:** 100-150 properties (refined from base preset of 592 sites)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
3. Developed area percentage: is less than 30
4. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
6. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
7. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
```

**Rationale:**
Building on the Infill preset (#8), which pre-calculates C3 sites with space for additional dwellings, this refines for capital constraints (0.1-0.5 acres, <30% developed for land-rich sites) and clean planning. Brentwood's 592 infill sites indicate strong residential demand and commuter appeal. This uses precedent-based strategies (Pattern 1A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md) by targeting existing C3 with garden space for PDR infill, exploiting motivation from private owners with legacy holdings. LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md confirms low EPC and long hold periods signal tired owners, while preset #16 (Houses with big gardens: 181 sites) validates the land-rich approach.

**Strengths:**
- Pre-calculated by SearchLand (road access and space confirmed)
- Low capital entry (garden infill often PDR-eligible)
- High volume in Brentwood (592 base sites)
- Private owners often motivated (family homes, not developers)

**Limitations:**
- Requires existing C3 use (not commercial conversions)
- Planning still needed if not PDR (though many qualify)
- Smaller profit per deal (1-2 additional units)
- Competition from local builders

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for sites with >70% unconstrained space; prioritize those with <1 application in 5 years (stale owners per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md).
2. Approach private owners with infill proposals (PDR for additional dwelling).
3. Secure option (£5k-£10k) while applying for planning/PDR.
4. Build 1-2 units on garden land (cost £50k-£100k).
5. Sell at £250k-£350k each for £150k+ profit.
6. Volume strategy: 3-4 deals/year for £450k-£600k annual profit, leveraging Brentwood's residential demand.

### Approach C: Grey Belt Workaround Conversions

**Strategic Pattern:** Niche Opportunities (Pattern 9A: Green Belt Workarounds)

**Capital Required:** £75,000-£200,000 per deal (constrained sites often cheaper)

**Expected Results:** 50-80 properties (refined from base preset of 170 sites)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Planning constraints: contains any [Green Belt]
2. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 50
3. Hardstanding percentage: is greater than 25
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
5. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
7. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:**
Utilizing the Grey Belt preset (#7) with 170 sites in Brentwood, this targets "previously developed" land in Green Belt (hardstanding >25% as proxy per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md). Refinements focus on capital-efficient commercial conversions to residential, exploiting the exception to Green Belt protection. This is a niche arbitrage play (Pattern 9A) where owners may not realize the "previously developed" loophole, creating information advantage. Brentwood's periphery Green Belt constraints make this strategic, with preset #43 (GB sites with hardstanding) validating the approach.

**Strengths:**
- Access to cheaper Green Belt sites (less competition)
- "Previously developed" exception reduces planning risk
- Hardstanding proxy identifies viable brownfield conversions
- Lower acquisition costs in constrained areas

**Limitations:**
- Still requires planning permission (not automatic)
- Green Belt opposition possible (local politics)
- Limited to sites with >25% hardstanding
- May face Section 106/CIL obligations

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify sites with >25% hardstanding (previously developed indicator); verify via Land Registry for clean title.
2. Approach owners with conversion proposals (commercial to residential via planning).
3. Secure option (£10k-£15k) for planning process (6-12 months).
4. Convert to 2-4 residential units (cost £75k-£150k).
5. Sell at £200k-£300k each for £150k+ profit.
6. Volume strategy: 2-3 deals/year for £300k-£450k annual profit, targeting Brentwood's edge settlements.
