# Time-Based & Policy Arbitrage Opportunities

**Last Updated:** 2024-12-17  
**Goal:** Find opportunities where regulatory/policy changes OR simple form filing creates value uplift  
**Geography:** 17 London LPAs (Bromley + surrounding)

## 🎯 REAL ARBITRAGE MECHANISMS

### What Arbitrage Actually Means Here:
- **Buy BEFORE** a policy change or event that increases value
- **File a form** or **wait for policy adoption** → value increases
- Profit = difference between "unaware" purchase price and "new reality" value

### What's NOT Realistic:
- ❌ "Day 0 planning approval" calls to owners (they already know, they applied!)
- ❌ Racing to call someone within 24 hours of consent
- ❌ Assuming homeowners don't understand their own planning applications

## 📋 ARBITRAGE PRESET CATEGORIES

### CATEGORY 1: Emerging Allocation Arbitrage (Policy Adoption)

**Mechanism:** Buy land in "emerging" local plan allocations BEFORE the plan is adopted. When plan is adopted → land value increases 2-5x.

**SearchLand Preset:** "Emerging sites without planning"
- **Description:** Freehold land (4k-40k sqm) in an "emerging" housing allocation with no planning yet
- **Strategy:** Secure the land, wait for the policy to be adopted, get consent, and flip
- **Baseline (17 LPAs):** ~53 sites

**Why This Works:**
1. Councils publish draft local plans (emerging allocations)
2. Sites get allocated for housing/development
3. Plan goes through consultation (12-24 months)
4. Plan adopted → allocation becomes policy → value uplift
5. You buy during "emerging" phase at lower price

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Emerging allocation land: £50k-£200k/acre
- Adopted allocation land: £200k-£500k/acre
- Your profit: 2-5x if you wait for adoption

**Risk:** Plan may not be adopted, allocation may be removed, timelines unpredictable

### CATEGORY 2: Lease Expiry Arbitrage (Predictable Events)

**Mechanism:** Contact commercial landlords 3-6 months BEFORE lease expires. Offer to buy before they face void period.

#### Preset A: "Commercial with expiring leases"
- **Description:** Medium commercial sites with leases ending before 2027
- **Baseline (17 LPAs):** 153 sites
- **Strategy:** Buy at discount (landlord avoids void), convert to residential (Class MA)

#### Preset B: "Fast food restaurant sites (expired leases)"
- **Description:** Fast food or café sites with expired leases and undeveloped land
- **Baseline (17 LPAs):** 56 sites
- **Strategy:** Tenant already left, landlord has vacant unit, maximum motivation

**Why This Works:**
1. Lease expiry date is PUBLIC information (Land Registry)
2. Landlord faces: void period, rates liability, finding new tenant
3. You offer certainty: cash purchase, quick completion
4. Discount: 10-20% below market (certainty premium)

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Commercial value: £300k
- Your purchase (motivated): £240k-£270k (10-20% discount)
- Convert to residential (Class MA): +£150k build cost
- Sell as flats: £600k-£800k
- Your profit: £130k-£260k

---

### CATEGORY 3: Licensing Compliance Arbitrage (Regulatory Pressure)

**Mechanism:** Find landlords with expired/expiring licenses who face compliance pressure.

#### Preset: "HMO expired licences"
- **Description:** Houses in multiple occupation with expired licences
- **Baseline (17 LPAs):** 331 sites
- **Strategy:** Buy from landlord facing fines, convert to single dwelling OR renew license

**Why This Works:**
1. HMO license expired = CAN'T legally rent
2. Landlord options: renew (expensive, hassle) OR sell (easiest)
3. Every day without license = lost income + prosecution risk
4. You offer: cash purchase, take the problem away

**Profit Mechanism:**
- HMO value (with valid license): £400k
- Your purchase (expired license, motivated): £320k-£360k (10-20% discount)
- Option A: Renew license yourself, continue as HMO (rental income)
- Option B: Convert to single dwelling (may increase value in some areas)
- Your profit: £40k-£80k immediate equity

---

### CATEGORY 4: Policy Change Arbitrage (Regulatory Shifts)

**Mechanism:** Monitor for regulatory changes that instantly create value uplift.

#### Example A: Article 4 Direction Lifted
- **What:** Council removes Article 4 direction from an area
- **Effect:** Permitted Development rights (Class MA, etc.) suddenly apply
- **Arbitrage:** Properties in that area can now convert commercial→residential without planning
- **Challenge:** Can't filter for "Article 4 lifted" in SearchLand - requires council monitoring

#### Example B: Use Class Changes
- **What:** Government creates new use classes (e.g., Class E in 2020)
- **Effect:** Existing properties gain conversion rights they didn't have before
- **Arbitrage:** Buy Class E property → convert to residential via Class MA
- **SearchLand Filter:** `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]`

#### Example C: Green Belt Review
- **What:** Council releases sites from Green Belt in local plan review
- **Effect:** Land value increases 5-20x (Green Belt → developable)
- **Arbitrage:** Identify sites likely to be released (council consultation documents)
- **SearchLand Proxy:** Monitor Green Belt sites near existing settlements

#### Example D: EPC Minimum Standard Changes (April 2025)
- **What:** New EPC regulations make F/G rated properties unlettable
- **Effect:** Landlords with F/G properties face: upgrade OR sell
- **Arbitrage:** Buy at discount from landlords who can't afford upgrade
- **SearchLand Filter:** `EPC rating: is one of [F, G]`

---

### CATEGORY 5: Simple Form Filing Arbitrage

**Mechanism:** Buy property, file a simple form/application, value increases.

#### Example A: Certificate of Lawfulness (CLEUD/CLOPUD)
- **What:** Confirm existing use or proposed use is lawful
- **Cost:** £200-£500 application fee
- **Effect:** Provides certainty to buyers, increases marketability
- **Arbitrage:** Buy property with unclear planning status, file CLEUD, sell with certainty

#### Example B: Prior Approval (Class MA, Class Q, etc.)
- **What:** Simplified application for permitted development
- **Cost:** £100-£200 application fee
- **Timeline:** 56 days determination
- **Effect:** Confirms conversion rights, value increases
- **Arbitrage:** Buy commercial property, file Prior Approval, sell with consent

#### Example C: Discharge of Conditions
- **What:** Property has planning permission with unmet conditions
- **Effect:** Until conditions discharged, consent can't be implemented
- **Arbitrage:** Buy property with unimplemented consent, discharge conditions, value increases
- **Your reference case (Hillingdon):** This is exactly what that application was for

## 📊 PRESET FILTER TESTS (17 London LPAs)

### Tests Completed (2024-12-17)

| Preset | Baseline | With Filters | Status |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| Run down homes | 646 | 0 (with motivated seller filters) | ❌ Doesn't work |
| Recent Planning Apps (30 days) | 272 | 0 (with unaware owner filters) | ❌ Doesn't work |
| **Emerging sites without planning** | **53** | Base preset | ✅ **WORKS - Real arbitrage** |

### Emerging Sites Without Planning - DETAILED RESULTS

**Initial Results:** 53 Opportunities Found

**Preset Filters Applied:**
```
+ Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
+ Site allocation type: is one of [Housing Allocation (Emerging)]
+ Max number of dwellings applied for: is less than [1]
+ Title area (acres): is between [0.988] and [9.884]
+ Developed area percentage: is less than [3]
```

**PROBLEM DISCOVERED:** First result was corporate-owned (SOUTHGATE-3 LTD, owned by private equity fund Mcp Private Capital Fund III). Professional developers already buying allocated sites.

**SOLUTION:** Added filter `Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]`

**Refined Results:** 12 sites with Private Ownership ✅

---

### Example Arbitrage Opportunity Found:

**Property:** Land Adjoining And To The Rear Of 14 - 20, Croydon, CR0 8XY

**Why This Works:**
| Factor | Value | Arbitrage Signal |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Ownership | **Private** | ✅ Individual, not developer |
| Area | 3.53 acres | ✅ Good development size |
| Build % | 0.0% | ✅ Raw land |
| Unconstrained | 73.35% | ✅ Mostly developable |
| Planning apps | 1 (TPO tree, rejected) | ✅ No housing application |

**The Allocation:**
- **Location:** Land at Poppy Lane, CR0 8YT
- **Type:** Housing (Emerging plan)
- **Published:** 28/06/2024 (6 months ago)
- **Units:** 123 homes allocated
- **Policy ID:** Site 128 - Residential development

**Arbitrage Calculation:**
- Owner may value as "backland": £50k-£100k/acre → ~£265k total
- With adopted allocation: £500k-£1m/acre → ~£2.5m+ total
- Per plot value: 123 units × £20k = £2.4m
- **Potential profit: £1m+**

---

**Key Learning:** The arbitrage thesis WORKS but only for **Private Owners** (12 of 53 sites). Corporate/developer owners have already identified and acquired allocated sites.

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What Works (Realistic Arbitrage):
1. ✅ **Emerging allocations** - Buy before plan adoption, sell after
2. ✅ **Lease expiry** - Predictable motivation window, contact 3-6 months ahead
3. ✅ **License expiry** - Compliance pressure creates urgency
4. ✅ **Policy changes** - Monitor council announcements, position ahead
5. ✅ **Simple form filing** - Prior Approval, CLEUD, Discharge of Conditions

### What Doesn't Work:
1. ❌ "Day 0 planning consent" calls - Owners know they applied
2. ❌ Racing to contact within 24 hours - Not realistic
3. ❌ Combining multiple "motivated seller" filters - Returns 0 results
4. ❌ Assuming information asymmetry where none exists

### SearchLand Limitations:
- ❌ No "Planning status" filter (Approved/Refused/Pending)
- ❌ No "Article 4 lifted" filter
- ❌ No "Policy changed in last X days" filter
- ✅ Does have: Lease expiry, License expiry, Allocations, EPC ratings

## 📚 REFERENCE: Hillingdon Case Study

**Your reference case demonstrates "Discharge of Conditions" arbitrage:**

**Reference:** 76722/APP/2024/2583  
**What:** Discharging conditions on existing planning permission  
**Original consent:** 76722/APP/2023/2200 (3 bed house + garage, part demolition)  
**Conditions discharged:** Landscape, Management Plan, Water Management

**Arbitrage Lesson:**
- Property had consent but couldn't be implemented (conditions unmet)
- Filing discharge application = unlocks the consent
- Value uplift = consent goes from "theoretical" to "implementable"
- Cost = application fee + reports (£2k-£10k)
- Value increase = potentially £50k-£200k
