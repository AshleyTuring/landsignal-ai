# **APPROACH J: Infill Development Opportunities**

**Status:** ✅ VALID (After adding Use class filter)  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 3 (Niche Strategy - Garden Subdivision)  
**Capital Required:** £50,000 - £150,000  
**Expected Results:** 30-60 properties (from 181 preset base)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**⚠️ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED:**
- Added Line 1: "Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]" (was missing, would return all land types)

```
1. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Title size (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1
4. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 60
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, AONB]
6. Has road access: is equal to Yes
```

## **Rationale**

**Garden infill strategy** leveraging Preset #11 (181 "Houses with big gardens" in Brentwood):
- **Large gardens:** 0.25-1 acre plots (space for additional dwelling)
- **PDR Class A:** Permitted development for garden buildings (or full planning for house)
- **Road access:** Essential for new dwelling (independent access)
- **Clean planning:** 60%+ unconstrained, excludes major designations

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: House with large garden at £50k-£150k (garden only, or option agreement)
- Develop: 1-2 infill homes (£120k-£180k build via development finance)
- Sell: New homes at £300k-£400k each
- Profit: £130k-£250k per plot

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Low capital (£50k-£150k for land/option, rest financed)
- ✅ High volume (181 preset sites refined to 30-60 properties)
- ✅ PDR potential (Class A for garden buildings, or full planning)
- ✅ Road access filter (critical for new dwelling)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Planning risk (full planning required for house, not PDR)
- ⚠️ Development finance required (£120k-£180k build)
- ⚠️ Seller motivation variable (not all will subdivide)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA
2. Run prompt, export 30-60 results

**Phase 2: Plot Analysis (Week 1-2)**
1. Check plot dimensions (need 10m+ width for new dwelling)
2. Verify road access type (independent access vs shared drive)
3. Eliminate plots <0.3 acres (too small for infill)

**Phase 3: Owner Outreach (Week 2-3)**
1. Contact owners with option agreement offer (£20k-£50k option, £100k-£150k land purchase on planning)
2. Emphasize "unlock garden value" (£100k-£200k gain with no effort)
3. Target retirees/downsizers (motivated to monetize land)

**Phase 4: Planning & Development (Week 4-24)**
1. Submit planning application (4-6 months)
2. If approved: Complete land purchase (£100k-£150k)
3. Secure development finance (£120k-£180k build)
4. Build and sell (12-18 months total)

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Option Agreement:** £20,000 - £50,000
- **Land Purchase:** £100,000 - £150,000 (on planning approval)
- **Development Costs:** £120,000 - £180,000 (financed)
- **Total Upfront:** £120,000 - £200,000
