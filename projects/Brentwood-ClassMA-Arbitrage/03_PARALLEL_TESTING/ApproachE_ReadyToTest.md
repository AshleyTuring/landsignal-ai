**⚠️ FIXES APPLIED:**
- Removed Line 1: "Local planning authority: is Brentwood" (filter doesn't exist)

**Note:** Select Brentwood LPA manually in SearchLand UI (LPA filter doesn't exist in SearchLand)

## **Rationale**

Micro-conversions (1,000-3,000 sqft small commercial → 2-4 flats):
- **Low capital:** £103k-£147k total (acquisition + conversion within £200k)
- **Freehold:** Full control, no ground rent leakage
- **Height restriction:** <12m (avoids tall building policies)
- **High density:** 2-4 flats per building (£150k+ profit)

**Profit Mechanism (ROI Example):**
- Acquire: 2,000 sqft office at £120k
- Convert: Class MA to 3 × 667 sqft flats (£30k-£50k costs)
- Value: 3 flats × £250k each = £750k
- Profit: £750k - £120k - £40k = £590k (or £250k realistic after costs)
- ROI: 167% on £150k capital

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Low capital (£103k-£147k fits budget comfortably)
- ✅ Class MA = permitted development (no planning risk)
- ✅ Micro scale (easier to manage than large projects)
- ✅ Freehold = long-term option hold

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Small profit per deal (£100k-£200k vs £200k-£400k for larger projects)
- ⚠️ Conversion costs variable (£30k-£50k depending on condition)
- ⚠️ Missing LPA filter means manual geography selection

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. **CRITICAL:** Manually select "Brentwood" LPA in SearchLand UI (before pasting prompt)
2. Paste prompt, run search
3. Export 15-25 results

**Phase 2: Quick Filters (Week 1-2)**
1. Prioritize sites <£130k (leaves £70k for conversion + contingency)
2. Eliminate sites with structural red flags
3. Calculate ROI for top 10 sites

**Phase 3: Site Visits & Offers (Week 2-3)**
1. Visit top 5 sites
2. Make offers on top 2 (15-20% below asking)

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £100,000 - £130,000
- **Conversion:** £30,000 - £50,000
- **Legal/Survey:** £3,000 - £5,000
- **Holding Costs:** £5,000 - £10,000
- **Total:** £138,000 - £195,000
