## **Rationale**

HMO (House in Multiple Occupation) conversion for cashflow, not capital appreciation:
- **Volume play:** Scale to 5-10 properties via refinancing (capital recycling)
- **Article 4 avoidance:** Areas without HMO restrictions (permitted development)
- **Large houses:** 4+ bedrooms, 1,500-2,500 sqft (convert to 5-6 bed HMO)
- **EPC C-E:** Energy improvements add value (£5k-£10k spend)

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: 4-bed house at £150k-£200k
- Convert: To 5-6 bed HMO (£15k-£25k refurb)
- Rent: £400-£500/room × 5-6 rooms = £2,000-£3,000/month
- Cashflow: £10k-£15k/year after costs
- Refinance: 75% LTV (£112k-£150k), recycle into next property

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Cashflow-focused (£10k-£15k/year passive income)
- ✅ Capital recycling (refinance → buy more HMOs)
- ✅ Article 4 filter ensures permitted development (no planning risk)
- ✅ Scalable to 5-10 properties (£50k-£150k/year income)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Operationally intensive (tenant management, maintenance)
- ⚠️ Licensing costs (£500-£1,000/year HMO license)
- ⚠️ Refinancing-dependent (75% LTV required to recycle capital)
- ⚠️ Market-dependent (HMO demand varies by area)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA
2. Run prompt, export 10-20 results

**Phase 2: HMO Market Research (Week 1-2)**
1. Check Rightmove/SpareRoom for HMO rental demand in Brentwood
2. Identify high-demand areas (near train station, town center)
3. Verify HMO licensing requirements (£500-£1,000/year)

**Phase 3: Site Visits (Week 2-3)**
1. Visit top 5 properties, assess conversion suitability
2. Check room sizes (min 6.5 sqm per room for HMO)
3. Estimate refurb costs (£15k-£25k for 5-6 bed HMO)

**Phase 4: Offers & Refinance Plan (Week 3-4)**
1. Make offers on top 2 properties (10-15% below asking)
2. Secure bridging finance (if needed for refurb)
3. Plan refinance strategy (75% LTV after 6 months)

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £150,000 - £200,000
- **Legal/Survey:** £3,000 - £5,000
- **HMO Conversion:** £15,000 - £25,000
- **Licensing/Compliance:** £2,000 - £5,000
- **Total:** £170,000 - £235,000

**Financing Strategy (Capital Recycling):**
- Property 1: Use £200k (acquisition £150k-£200k + conversion £15k-£25k)
- Refinance after 6 months: 75% LTV = £112k-£150k back
- Property 2: Use refinanced capital + £50k-£85k additional
- Repeat for 5-10 properties over 2-3 years
