**⚠️ FIXES APPLIED:**
- Line 6: Changed "Building has flat roof" → "A building in the title has flat roof"
- Line 8: Changed "Addresses" → "Number of addresses"

```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Mixed use]
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000 AND less than 10000
4. Sales listing price: is less than 200000
5. Developed area percentage: is greater than 40
6. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
7. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
8. Number of addresses: is less than 8
```

## **Rationale**

Airspace development (adding floors above existing buildings) is capital-efficient:
- **Low upfront:** £50k-£105k acquires building + airspace rights
- **Development finance:** 60-70% LTV for £600k-£800k build
- **Profit:** 1-2 additional floors = £200k-£450k profit

Targets:
- **Mixed-use/commercial:** Freehold titles with flat roofs
- **Small-medium sites:** 2,000-10,000 sqft (manageable scale)
- **Low height:** <15m (avoids tall building policies)
- **Few addresses:** <8 units (easier leaseholder negotiations if flats)

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: Mixed-use building at £150k-£200k
- Negotiate: Airspace rights with existing leaseholders (if applicable)
- Develop: Add 1-2 floors (£600k-£800k build via development finance)
- Value uplift: New flats sell at £350k-£450k each × 2-3 units = £700k-£1.35M
- Profit: £200k-£450k

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Capital-efficient (£50k-£105k upfront, rest financed)
- ✅ High profit potential (£200k-£450k)
- ✅ Freehold control (no ground rent/service charge leakage)
- ✅ Mixed-use targets motivated sellers (difficult to sell/manage)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Complex negotiations (leaseholder consent if flats)
- ⚠️ Planning risk (not permitted development, requires full approval)
- ⚠️ Development finance required (£600k-£800k)
- ⚠️ 18-24 month timeline (longer than PD routes)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA
2. Run prompt, export 8-15 results

**Phase 2: Structural Feasibility (Week 1-2)**
1. Check flat roof condition (must support additional load)
2. Verify building height <15m (avoid tall building policy)
3. Eliminate sites with leaseholders >8 units (complex negotiations)

**Phase 3: Planning Pre-App (Week 2-4)**
1. Submit planning pre-application for top 3 sites
2. Check local plan policies on airspace/upward extensions
3. Assess neighboring objection risk

**Phase 4: Offers & Finance (Week 4-6)**
1. Make offers on top 2 sites (subject to planning)
2. Secure development finance commitment (60-70% LTV)
3. Negotiate leaseholder consent (if applicable)

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £150,000 - £200,000
- **Legal/Survey:** £3,000 - £5,000
- **Planning/Pre-App:** £2,000 - £5,000
- **Total Upfront:** £155,000 - £210,000
- **Development Costs:** £600,000 - £800,000 (financed)

**Financing Strategy:**
- Use £200k for acquisition + legals + planning
- Secure development finance: £600k-£800k (60-70% LTV on GDV)
- Total project: £800k-£1M GDV, £200k-£450k profit
