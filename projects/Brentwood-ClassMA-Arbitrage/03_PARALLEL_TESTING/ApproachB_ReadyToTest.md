```
1. Current use: contains any [Agricultural, Farm Buildings, Agricultural Buildings, Barns]
2. Agricultural land classification: contains any [Grade 3, Grade 3a, Grade 3b, Grade 4, Grade 5]
3. Building floor area (sqft): is greater than 1000 AND less than 6000
4. Building on title is derelict: is equal to No
5. Title size (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
6. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [AONB, National Park, SSSI, Conservation Area]
8. % of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0
```

## **Rationale**

Class Q permits agricultural building→residential conversion (up to 5 units, max 465 sqm developed area). Preset #9 identifies 44 sites in Brentwood. This approach targets:
- **Lower capital:** £100k-£150k acquisition (below £200k budget)
- **Grade 3-5 land:** Not "best and most versatile" (Grade 1-2), easier planning
- **Small sites:** 0.5-5 acres (manageable scale)
- **Active buildings:** Not derelict (structural integrity intact)

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: Agricultural building at £100k-£150k
- Convert: Class Q to residential (9-15 months, £100k-£150k costs)
- Value uplift: Agricultural £20-£40/sqft → Residential £350-£450/sqft
- Example: 3,000 sqft barn @ £120k → 3 x 1,000 sqft homes @ £450k = £270k profit

## **Strengths**

- ✅ High profit potential (£200k-£400k per deal)
- ✅ Low acquisition cost (£100k-£150k leaves capital for conversion)
- ✅ Class Q = minimal planning risk (prior approval only)
- ✅ Preset #9 (44 sites) provides pre-filtered pool

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Conversion costs high (£100k-£150k) - requires bridging finance
- ⚠️ 10-year agricultural use requirement (verify with planning)
- ⚠️ Structural surveys critical (barns may have asbestos, structural issues)
- ⚠️ Remote locations (agricultural land less accessible)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA in SearchLand UI
2. Paste prompt, run search
3. Export 15-25 results

**Phase 2: Desktop Analysis (Week 1-2)**
1. Check planning portal for 10-year agricultural use evidence
2. Eliminate sites with Article 4 Directions (blocks Class Q)
3. Prioritize sites near villages (better resale demand)

**Phase 3: Site Visits (Week 2-3)**
1. Visit top 5 sites, assess structural condition
2. Check for asbestos, roof integrity, foundations
3. Measure floor area (max 465 sqm developed area for Class Q)

**Phase 4: Financing & Offers (Week 3-4)**
1. Secure bridging finance (70% LTV, 9-12 months, £100k-£150k)
2. Make offers on top 2 sites (15-20% below asking)
3. Instruct structural survey + planning consultant

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £100,000 - £150,000
- **Legal/Survey:** £3,000 - £5,000
- **Conversion Costs:** £100,000 - £150,000 (bridging finance)
- **Holding Costs:** £10,000 - £15,000 (12-15 months interest)
- **Total:** £213,000 - £320,000

**Financing Strategy:**
- Use £200k for: Acquisition (£100k-£150k) + legals (£3k-£5k) + holding (£10k-£15k) = £113k-£170k
- Secure bridging loan: £100k-£150k (70% LTV on completed value)
- Refinance on completion: 75% LTV residential mortgage
