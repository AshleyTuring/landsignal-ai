## **Rationale**

Target large, low-EPC houses before 2025 EPC C regulations force landlords to sell:
- **Motivated sellers:** EPC E-G properties face rental restrictions (must upgrade to EPC C by 2025)
- **Article 4 avoidance:** No HMO restrictions (permitted development)
- **Large houses:** 4+ bedrooms, 1,800+ sqft (convert to 5-6 bed HMO)
- **EPC upgrade:** £10k-£15k spend improves EPC to C (adds value + compliance)

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: 4-bed EPC E house at £150k (seller motivated by regulation deadline)
- Upgrade: EPC to C (£10k-£15k: insulation, boiler, windows)
- Convert: To 5-6 bed HMO (£15k-£20k refurb)
- Rent: £400-£500/room × 5-6 rooms = £2,000-£3,000/month
- Cashflow: £12k-£18k/year after costs

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Motivated sellers (EPC regulation deadline creates urgency)
- ✅ Below-market pricing (EPC discount 10-15%)
- ✅ Dual value-add (EPC upgrade + HMO conversion)
- ✅ Article 4 filter ensures permitted development

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ EPC upgrade costs (£10k-£15k)
- ⚠️ Regulation risk (EPC C requirement may tighten further)
- ⚠️ HMO operational intensity

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**

2. Run prompt, export 10-20 results

**Phase 2: EPC Analysis (Week 1-2)**

1. Contact sellers with low offers (15-20% below asking)
2. Emphasize quick cash purchase (EPC issue solved)
3. Visit top 3 properties

**Phase 4: Conversion & Licensing (Week 4-6)**
1. Complete EPC upgrade (£10k-£15k)
2. Convert to HMO (£15k-£20k)
3. Obtain HMO license (£500-£1,000/year)
