## **Rationale**

**Off-market arbitrage:** Target commercial freeholds with expiring leases (2027 deadline):
- **Motivated sellers:** Landlords facing vacant properties (lease expiry) = distress pricing
- **Off-market:** Not actively listed (less competition, better pricing)
- **Low activity:** <1 application in 5 years (overlooked properties)
- **Time pressure:** Lease expiry by 2027 creates urgency

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: Commercial freehold at £150k-£180k (10-15% below market, distress pricing)
- Convert: Class MA to residential (£40k-£60k)
- Value: £400k-£500k (residential uplift)
- Profit: £160k-£250k

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Off-market (no listing = less competition)
- ✅ Motivated sellers (lease expiry urgency)
- ✅ Time arbitrage (2027 deadline drives pricing)
- ✅ Low activity (overlooked properties)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Outreach required (off-market = manual contact)
- ⚠️ Low volume (5-10 properties expected)
- ⚠️ Lease complications (existing tenant rights)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA
2. Run prompt, export 5-10 results

**Phase 2: Direct Outreach (Week 1-2)**
1. Find owner contact details (Land Registry, Companies House)
2. Send letters/emails with cash offer (emphasize speed, lease expiry solution)
3. Position as "off-market buyer" (avoid auction/agent fees)

**Phase 3: Negotiation (Week 2-3)**
1. Offer 10-15% below market (distress pricing)
2. Structure deal: Cash purchase, 4-6 week completion (urgency premium)
3. Site visits for top 2 properties

**Phase 4: Conversion (Week 4-12)**
1. Complete acquisition
2. Convert via Class MA (£40k-£60k)
3. Sell or refinance

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £150,000 - £180,000
- **Conversion:** £40,000 - £60,000
- **Legal/Survey:** £3,000 - £5,000
- **Total:** £193,000 - £245,000

**Financing:** If >£200k, use bridging for conversion costs
