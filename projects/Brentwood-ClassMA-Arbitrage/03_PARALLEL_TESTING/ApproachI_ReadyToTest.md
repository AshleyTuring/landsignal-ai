```

## **Rationale**

**Broad Class MA search** leveraging Preset #13 (209 sites in Brentwood):
- **Wide use classes:** E(a)-E(e) captures most commercial types
- **No price cap:** User instructed to explore all opportunities (£200k+ deals use financing)
- **Large volume:** 209 preset sites refined to 40-80 properties
- **Flexible size:** 800-6,000 sqft (small to medium commercial)

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: Commercial property at £100k-£200k
- Convert: Class MA to residential (£30k-£80k depending on size)
- Value: £300k-£500k (residential uplift)
- Profit: £120k-£300k

## **Strengths**

- ✅ High volume (40-80 properties = choice)
- ✅ Broad search (doesn't over-filter, preserves opportunities)
- ✅ Preset #13 leverage (209 sites pre-filtered for Class MA eligibility)
- ✅ Flexible capital (£100k-£200k range)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Manual sorting required (40-80 results need filtering)
- ⚠️ No price cap (user must manually exclude >£200k if capital-constrained)
- ⚠️ Variable quality (broad search = more noise)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA
2. Run prompt, export 40-80 results
3. Sort by price (prioritize <£150k for capital fit)

**Phase 2: Desktop Filters (Week 1-2)**
1. Eliminate >£200k properties (if capital-constrained)
2. Prioritize sites with high residential demand (near town center, train station)
3. Calculate ROI for top 15 sites

**Phase 3: Site Visits (Week 2-3)**
1. Visit top 10 sites (high volume = batch site visits)
2. Assess conversion suitability
3. Shortlist top 5 for offers

**Phase 4: Offers (Week 3-4)**
1. Make offers on top 3 sites (10-15% below asking)
2. Move fast (high volume = multiple opportunities)

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £100,000 - £200,000
- **Conversion:** £30,000 - £80,000
- **Legal/Survey:** £3,000 - £5,000
- **Total:** £133,000 - £285,000

**Financing:** If total >£200k, use bridging for conversion costs
