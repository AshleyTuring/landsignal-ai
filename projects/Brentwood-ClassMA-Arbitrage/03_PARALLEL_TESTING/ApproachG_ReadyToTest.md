```
1. Use class: contains any [E(a) - Retail, E(b) - Cafes, E(c)(i) - Financial services, E(c)(ii) - Professional services]
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 500 AND less than 2000
4. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
5. Developed area percentage: is greater than 25
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 50
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, Listed Building]
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
9. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 2
```

## **Rationale**

**Sniper strategy:** 9 restrictive filters to find hidden gems (low volume, high quality):
- **On-market only:** Active listings (motivated sellers)
- **Low price:** <£150k (capital discipline)
- **Small scale:** 500-2,000 sqft (micro-conversions)
- **Clean planning:** Multiple constraint exclusions
- **Low activity:** <2 applications in 5 years (overlooked properties)

**Note:** LLMs debated this approach's viability (Codex/Gemini said "over-constrained", Claude/Grok said "precedent-based = auto-valid"). Round 3 consensus: **Sniper strategy acceptable, user can test volume.**

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: Small retail/cafe at £120k-£140k
- Convert: Class MA to 2 × 800 sqft flats (£25k-£40k)
- Value: 2 flats × £220k each = £440k
- Profit: £440k - £130k - £32k = £278k (or £150k+ realistic)

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Capital discipline (<£150k leaves room for conversion)
- ✅ On-market focus (active sellers, faster deals)
- ✅ Clean planning (multiple exclusions reduce risk)
- ✅ Precedent-based (user requested Class MA)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Low volume (5-15 properties expected, not 50+)
- ⚠️ Over-filtering risk (may return 0-5 results)
- ⚠️ On-market only (misses off-market deals)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA
2. Run prompt, export results
3. **If <5 results:** Relax 1-2 filters (e.g., increase price to £175k or remove "on-market" filter)

**Phase 2: Quick Analysis (Week 1)**
1. Review all results (low volume)
2. Prioritize sites with high footfall (retail/cafe conversions)
3. Calculate ROI for top 3-5 sites

**Phase 3: Fast Offers (Week 1-2)**
1. Make offers on top 2 sites (5-10% below asking, on-market = competitive)
2. Move quickly (sniper strategy = limited inventory)

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £120,000 - £140,000
- **Conversion:** £25,000 - £40,000
- **Legal/Survey:** £3,000 - £5,000
- **Total:** £148,000 - £185,000
