# **APPROACH K: Grey Belt Workaround Conversions**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (3 minute fix)  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 3 (Niche Strategy - Green Belt Workaround)  
**Capital Required:** £75,000 - £200,000  
**Expected Results:** 25-50 properties (from 170 preset base)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**⚠️ FIX APPLIED:**
- Line 3: Changed "Hardstanding percentage" → "Percentage of title covered by hard standings"

```
1. Planning constraints: contains all [Green Belt]
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2, B8, Sui Generis - Traveller site, Sui Generis - Vehicle/Machine]
3. Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 25
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 1000 AND less than 5000
5. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
6. Sales listing price: is less than 200000
```

## **Rationale**

**"Grey Belt" workaround** leveraging Preset #10 (170 sites in Brentwood):
- **Green Belt hardstanding:** 25%+ developed (brownfield exception to Green Belt policy)
- **Commercial/industrial:** Existing use weakens Green Belt protection
- **Conversion focus:** Harder than new-build in Green Belt, but existing buildings have loopholes
- **Freehold:** Full control, no ground rent

**Profit Mechanism:**
- Acquire: Green Belt commercial site with 25%+ hardstanding at £150k-£200k
- Argue: "Brownfield exception" + "Previously Developed Land" (weakens Green Belt protection)
- Convert: To residential (via Class MA if eligible, or full planning with brownfield argument)
- Value: £350k-£450k (residential uplift)
- Profit: £150k-£250k

## **Strengths**

- ✅ Niche strategy (most developers avoid Green Belt)
- ✅ Hardstanding filter (brownfield exception)
- ✅ High volume (170 preset sites)
- ✅ Commercial use (weakens Green Belt protection)

## **Limitations**

- ⚠️ Higher planning risk (Green Belt = stricter policies)
- ⚠️ Longer timeline (18-24 months for planning + conversion)
- ⚠️ Local plan dependent (some LPAs stricter on Green Belt)

## **Implementation Strategy**

**Phase 1: Initial Search (Week 1)**
1. Select Brentwood LPA
2. Run prompt, export 25-50 results

**Phase 2: Planning Policy Research (Week 1-2)**
1. Check Brentwood Local Plan Green Belt policies
2. Identify "Previously Developed Land" definition (hardstanding = PDL)
3. Find precedent planning applications (Green Belt commercial→residential approvals)

**Phase 3: Site Selection (Week 2-3)**
1. Prioritize sites with highest hardstanding % (>50% strongest case)
2. Eliminate sites with SSSI/AONB overlays (too constrained)
3. Visit top 5 sites, assess brownfield character

**Phase 4: Planning Pre-App (Week 3-6)**
1. Submit planning pre-application for top 2 sites
2. Argue "PDL exception" + "limited harm to Green Belt openness"
3. If positive: Make offer subject to planning

## **Capital Breakdown**

- **Acquisition:** £150,000 - £200,000
- **Planning Costs:** £5,000 - £10,000 (pre-app + full app)
- **Conversion Costs:** £40,000 - £80,000
- **Total:** £195,000 - £290,000

**Financing:** If >£200k, use bridging for conversion costs
