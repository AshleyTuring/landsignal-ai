# Technical & Business Case Iteration Task

## Context
You previously reviewed approaches and identified technical and business case issues. Other LLMs disagreed with some of your assessments.

## Your Task
**Reconsider your positions** based on the disagreement analysis below. You may:
1. **Maintain your position** (with additional evidence)
2. **Change your position** (if you were mistaken)
3. **Clarify your position** (if misunderstood)

## What to Focus On
- Factual correctness (filter existence, units, syntax)
- Business case viability (capital, ROI, implementation feasibility)
- Evidence-based reasoning (cite sources)
- Technical and financial precision (not strategic preference)

## Output Format
### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Approach [X]: Was [STATUS], now [STATUS] because [evidence]

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Approach [Y]: Still [STATUS] because [evidence]

**Clarifications:**
- [Any misunderstandings to clear up]


## DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS

Let me provide the analysis directly:

---

# DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

---

## Disagreement #1: NOT: Operator Syntax Validity
**Type:** Syntax
**Approaches:** Claude - Approach A (Class MA Arbitrage)

**Positions:**
- **Claude:** ✅ VALID - "SearchLand AI can parse this - it's non-standard but functional"
- **Codex:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "`NOT: Use class contains [C3]` is invalid"
- **Gemini:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Invalid Syntax... the `NOT` operator is not used this way"
- **Grok:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Invalid syntax: should be 'Use class: does not contain'"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES

---

## Disagreement #2: Agricultural Land Grade Filter Existence
**Type:** Filter existence
**Approaches:** Claude - Approach B (Class Q Agricultural)

**Positions:**
- **Claude:** ✅ VALID - "✅ Agricultural Land Grade - EXISTS (correct values)"
- **Codex:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "`Agricultural Land Grade` should be `Agricultural land classification`"
- **Gemini:** ✅ VALID - (No issue raised)
- **Grok:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "'Agricultural Land Grade' does not exist; correct is 'Agricultural land classification'"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES

---

## Disagreement #3: Article 4 Direction - HMO Validity
**Type:** Filter existence/naming
**Approaches:** Claude - Approach D (HMO Volume), Codex - Approach B

**Positions:**
- **Claude:** ✅ VALID - "'Article 4 Direction - HMO' may be a valid constraint value... likely a constraint value, not a filter name - acceptable syntax"
- **Codex:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Not a valid constraint value; use `Article 4: does not contain [Article 4]`"
- **Gemini:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Uses a value that is not listed... correct approach is to use the dedicated `Article 4` filter"
- **Grok:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Uses invalid value; correct is 'Article 4' or percentage filter"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES

---

## Disagreement #4: Boolean Syntax Requirements
**Type:** Syntax
**Approaches:** Gemini - Approach A & B

**Positions:**
- **Claude:**
  - Approach A: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "❌ Incorrect boolean syntax"
  - Approach B: ✅ VALID - "`Sales listing currently on the market: No` - **CORRECT SYNTAX** ✅"
- **Codex:** (Not analyzed in detail)
- **Gemini:**
  - Approach A: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Invalid Syntax... correct syntax is `is equal to Yes`"
  - Approach B: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Invalid Syntax... correct syntax is `is equal to No`"
- **Grok:**
  - Approach A: ✅ VALID - "All filters exist and syntax is correct"
  - Approach B: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Syntax error invalidates search"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES

**Analysis:** Inconsistent positions across LLMs and even within Claude's own analysis (Approach B marked correct, but Approach A marked incorrect using same syntax pattern).

---

## Disagreement #5: Use Class Filter Presence
**Type:** Filter completeness
**Approaches:** Grok - Approach B (Infill Development)

**Positions:**
- **Claude:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "`Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]` - **MISSING from prompt**... **critical omission**"
- **Codex:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - (Implies missing, suggests keeping C3)
- **Gemini:** ❌ INVALID - "Missing Critical Filter: The prompt is missing the core filter"
- **Grok:** ✅ VALID - "Filters are accurate... technically valid"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES

**Analysis:** Binary factual question - is the Use class filter in Grok Approach B's prompt or not? Claude/Gemini say NO (missing); Grok says YES (valid).

---

## Disagreement #6: Over-Constraining Business Case
**Type:** Business case feasibility
**Approaches:** Gemini - Approach A (Class MA Low Capital)

**Positions:**
- **Claude:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Combination of 9 restrictive filters will return **very few results** (likely 0-5)... will filter out 95%+ of potential opportunities"
- **Codex:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Very tight stack... may return zero"
- **Gemini:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL - "Highly likely to return zero results, making the approach practically unviable"
- **Grok:** ✅ VALID - "Capital fits £200k, ROI is implied achievable, and implementation is straightforward"

**Impact:** Critical  
**Requires iteration:** YES

**Analysis:** Business case dispute - three LLMs say approach will return 0-5 results (unviable); Grok says it's fully viable and straightforward.

---

## NON-DISAGREEMENTS (Consensus Validations)

The following are **NOT disagreements** - all LLMs agree on the errors:

1. ✅ "Addresses" → should be "Number of addresses" (All agree)
2. ✅ "Building has flat roof" → should be "A building in the title has flat roof" (All agree)
3. ✅ "Local planning authority" filter does not exist (All agree)
4. ✅ "Hardstanding percentage" → should be "Percentage of title covered by hard standings" (All agree)

---

## CAPITAL STRUCTURE DIFFERENCES (Not Technical Disputes)

The following are **philosophical differences** about how to interpret capital budgets, not factual disputes:

- Phased deployment / bridging finance / development finance / refinancing cascades
- All LLMs agree these structures are **feasible** and **industry-standard**
- Differences are only in whether explicit statement is required (Codex) vs implicit acceptance (Claude/Gemini)
- **Not classified as disagreements** per your instructions

---

## SUMMARY

**Total Disagreements Requiring Iteration: 6**

**Critical Technical Disputes (4):**
1. NOT: operator syntax validity (Claude A)
2. Agricultural Land Grade filter existence (Claude B)
3. Article 4 Direction - HMO constraint value validity (Claude D, Codex B)
4. Boolean operator requirements (Gemini A & B)

**Critical Completeness Disputes (1):**
5. Use class filter presence in prompt (Grok B)

**Critical Business Case Disputes (1):**
6. Over-constraining result volume viability (Gemini A)

**Consensus Validations: 4** (all LLMs agree = errors exist)

**Non-Disputes: ~6** (capital structure philosophy - all agree feasible)

## YOUR ORIGINAL CRITIQUE


## REFERENCE MATERIALS (ALL CONTENT INCLUDED BELOW)

## REFERENCE: SearchLand Available Filters (CRITICAL - Use ONLY These)

# SearchLand Available Filters

**Source:** Direct from SearchLand interface (HTML parsed)  
 
**IMPORTANT:** ⚠️ CRITICAL: If the constrained value or permitted filter value is not in here you can still use the filter and assume what the filter value could be. This is a living document and will be updated as we use each filter - dont be afraid of using filters. 

---

##  Filter Operators for List-Based Filters

**Many SearchLand filters use predefined value lists (not free text).** These filters have specific operators:

### Available Operators for List-Based Filters:

| Operator | Logic | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **contains any** | OR (implicit) - matches if ANY selected value is present | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| **contains all** | AND (implicit) - matches only if ALL selected values present | `Use class: contains all [E, C3]` |
| **does not contain** | Exclusion - excludes if value is present | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| **is equal to** | Exact match - only this specific value | `Use class: is equal to [E]` |

### ❌ INVALID Syntax (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Use class: E AND C3
```

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ✅ CORRECT Syntax:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]
✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** (predefined planning classes)
- **Property type** (Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.)
- **Property classification** (separate taxonomy from Use class)
- **Tenure** (Freehold, Leasehold, etc.)
- **Ownership type** (Corporate, Individual, etc.)
- Any filter showing checkbox options in the UI

### Text/Numeric Filters (Use comparison operators):
- **Title address:** `contains`, `does not contain` (free text)
- **Proposal:** `contains` (free text keyword search)
- **Title area (acres):** `is greater than`, `is less than`, `is equal to` (numeric)
- **Price:** `is greater than`, `is less than` (numeric)

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors. If the filter value is not document you can make some assumption about it's expected behaviour and create a filter based on that. We will test your assumption and document any discrepancies here. 

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: List-Based Filter Operators (MOST COMMON ERROR)

**ISSUE:** LLMs frequently write invalid syntax for filters with predefined value lists (Use class, Property type, etc.)

### The Problem

SearchLand filters with **predefined value lists** (shown as checkboxes in UI) use specific operators:
- `contains any` (OR logic - matches if ANY value is present)
- `contains all` (AND logic - requires ALL values)
- `does not contain` (exclusion)
- `is equal to` (exact match)

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ❌ INVALID Examples (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
   // SearchLand does not support OR operators within a filter line

❌ Use class: contains 'E' AND Use class: contains 'C3'
   // SearchLand does not support AND operators within a filter line

❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
   // Wrong syntax - no OR operators

❌ Use class: E AND C3
   // Wrong syntax - no AND operators
```

**Why This Fails:**
- SearchLand's AI prompt parser does not recognize `OR`/`AND`/`NOT` as operators
- It treats the entire string as a literal search term
- The filter will return zero results or unexpected matches

### ✅ CORRECT Examples:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Multiple values in single filter with "contains any" operator
   // This matches properties with EITHER E OR C3 (implicit OR)

✅ Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Requires BOTH E AND C3 to be present (implicit AND)

✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
   // Correct: Excludes properties with B2 use class

✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use, Residential]
   // Correct: Matches any of these property types

✅ Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
   // Correct: Exact match for single value
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** - Planning use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Property type** - Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.
- **Property classification** - Separate taxonomy from Use class
- **Tenure** - Freehold, Leasehold, etc.
- **Ownership type** - Corporate, Individual, etc.
- **Any filter showing checkbox options in UI**

### Syntax Pattern:

```
[Filter name]: [operator] [comma-separated list of values in square brackets]
```

**Examples:**
```
Use class: contains any [E, C3, C4]
Property type: does not contain [Agricultural]
Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
```

### Common Corrections:

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |
|-------------|-----------|
| `Use class: contains 'E' OR 'C3'` | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| `Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Mixed'` | `Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]` |
| `Use class: NOT 'B2'` | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| `Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'` | `Tenure: contains any [Freehold, Leasehold]` |

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**Boolean Operators in List-Based Filters:**
```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'C3'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
```
- List-based filters do NOT support `OR`, `AND`, `NOT` operators within a single filter line
- **Correct:** `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]`
- Use `contains any` for OR logic, `contains all` for AND logic

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

**Numeric Value Precision - Floating Point Conversion ⚠️**
```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Approach B validation)

BEHAVIOR:
SearchLand AI may convert integer values to floating-point precision internally.

EXAMPLE:
Your prompt:
  Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000

SearchLand AI creates:
  Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 1999.999

OBSERVATIONS:
- Integer values (2000) may display as floating-point (1999.999)
- This is an internal precision conversion, not a parsing error
- Functionally identical: 1999.999 ≈ 2000 (no practical difference)
- Affects numeric filters: area, price, distance, etc.

IMPLICATIONS:
✅ No functional impact on search results
✅ 1999.999 and 2000 return identical properties
⚠️ Display may look different from your prompt (cosmetic only)

RECOMMENDATION:
- Accept this behavior - it's cosmetic, not functional
- Don't try to "fix" it by adjusting your prompt
- Focus on the intent (>2000 sqft) rather than exact display value

Common conversions seen:
2000 → 1999.999
5000 → 4999.999
10000 → 9999.999
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

**Building Height - Auto-Conversion Behavior ⚠️**
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
SearchLand AI may auto-convert between height metrics:
- "Max building height on title (m): is less than 12" 
  → May create "Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4"
- Conversion assumes ~3m per floor
- Both filters exist separately in SearchLand

Available Height Filters:
✅ Max building height on title (m) - absolute height in metres
✅ Max number of building floors on title - storey count
✅ Number of building floors in title - actual floor count

RECOMMENDATION:
- If you want floors, specify floors (more reliable parsing)
- If you want metres, specify metres (but verify which filter was created)
- Always check SearchLand UI to confirm which filter was applied

Example:
# If you want 3-4 storey buildings:
✅ Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4  (explicit, reliable)
⚠️ Max building height on title (m): is less than 12  (may auto-convert to floors)

Conversion Reference:
12m ≈ 3-4 floors
15m ≈ 4-5 floors  
18m ≈ 5-6 floors
25m ≈ 7-9 floors
(Assumes 3-4m per storey)
```

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Latest sold date" - No Boolean "Never Sold" Filter ⚠️
```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Approach C validation)

CRITICAL ISSUE:
SearchLand AI has NO boolean "No latest sold date" or "Never sold" filter.

COMMON MISTAKE:
Attempting to use natural language like:
❌ "No latest sold date: Yes"
❌ "Latest sold date: does not exist"
❌ "Never sold: Yes"

WHAT HAPPENS:
SearchLand AI misinterprets these as date filters with extreme values:
- "No latest sold date: Yes" → "Latest sold date: is before 01/01/1800"
- This returns virtually zero results (properties sold before 1800 are extremely rare)

WHAT YOU PROBABLY WANT:
Properties with long-term ownership (held for many years without recent sale).

CORRECT APPROACH - Use Date Proxy:
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/1950  (75+ years, very long-term holdings)
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/1980  (45+ years, long-term holdings)
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2000  (25+ years, established holdings)
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2015  (10+ years, stable ownership)

RECOMMENDED PROXY DATES BY STRATEGY:
- Legacy holdings / Estate situations: before 1950 or 1980
- Long-term private owners: before 2000
- Stable ownership (not flippers): before 2015
- Recent acquisitions: after 2020

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH - Omit Sale Date Filter:
If you're looking for motivated sellers, consider:
- Removing sale date filter entirely
- Relying on other motivation signals:
  ✅ Ownership type: Company + Company status: Liquidation
  ✅ Building on title is derelict: Yes
  ✅ Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
  ✅ Low EPC ratings (E, F, G)

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Using "No latest sold date: Yes" will return ZERO or near-zero results.
Always use a date proxy instead.

Related: See "Sales listing currently on the market" for off-market strategies
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Sui Generis" Use Class - Display Name Clarification
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
When you filter for "Sui Generis" use class, SearchLand displays it as:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

CLARIFICATION:
- "Outside of the defined classes" = Sui Generis
- Sui Generis = Uses that don't fit into standard use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- Examples: Car showrooms, petrol stations, nightclubs, launderettes, taxi businesses, 
  scrap yards, casinos, theatres, amusement arcades, hostels, motor vehicle repair

Filter correctly parses when you use:
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]

Display in SearchLand UI:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

Note: This is just a display difference - the filter works correctly.
```

### "Property classification" Auto-Added by SearchLand AI
```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Approach B validation)

BEHAVIOR:
When you specify a "Use class" filter, SearchLand AI may automatically add a corresponding 
"Property classification" filter to ensure consistency.

EXAMPLE 1 - Without explicit Property classification:
Your prompt:
  Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses

SearchLand AI creates:
  1. Property classification: contains all [Residential]  (AUTO-ADDED)
  2. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]  (OPERATOR CHANGED)

EXAMPLE 2 - With explicit Property classification:
Your prompt:
  Property classification: contains all [Residential]
  Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses

SearchLand AI creates:
  1. Property classification: contains all [Residential]  (AS REQUESTED)
  2. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]  (OPERATOR STILL CHANGED)

OBSERVATIONS:
- SearchLand AI will auto-add "Property classification" if not specified
- SearchLand AI ALWAYS prefers "contains all" operator for Use class filters
- This operator preference persists even when you explicitly include Property classification
- For single-value Use class filters: "contains all [C3]" = "is equal to C3" (functionally identical)

IMPLICATIONS:
✅ Generally helpful - adds logical consistency
⚠️ Operator will be changed from "is equal to" → "contains all" (unavoidable)
✅ Functionally equivalent for single-value filters (no impact on results)
✅ Explicitly including "Property classification" prevents auto-addition but not operator change

RECOMMENDATION:
For residential searches, explicitly include both filters:
  Property classification: contains all [Residential]
  Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses

Benefits:
- ✅ Prevents unexpected auto-addition of Property classification
- ✅ Ensures both filters are present and controlled
- ⚠️ Accept that "is equal to" will become "contains all" (no functional impact)

```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Complex Multi-Line Prompts May Be Partially Ignored ⚠️ CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

ISSUE:
- When providing 8+ filter lines in a single prompt, SearchLand AI may only parse 2-3 filters
- More complex the prompt structure, higher the failure rate
- No clear pattern for which filters get dropped
- Can result in massively inflated result counts (e.g., 25,910 instead of 10-50)

Example Failure:
Prompt with 8 filters → Only 2 created (Max floors, Tenure auto-added)
Missing: Distance to station, title area, use class, sold date, applications, on market

SOLUTION:
1. **Simplify prompt structure:**
   - Separate compound AND conditions into individual lines
   - Avoid mixing multiple filter types in rapid sequence
   
2. **Break into smaller chunks:**
   - Start with 4-5 filters, verify they parse
   - Add remaining filters manually in UI if needed
   
3. **Always verify before clicking Search:**
   - Count filters created vs filters requested
   - Check filter names match what you asked for
   - Add missing filters manually using "Add Filter" button

Success Pattern (Iteration 2):
- Split "is greater than X AND less than Y" into two separate lines
- Used simpler filter names (e.g., "floors" instead of "height in metres")
- Result: 8/8 filters successfully parsed

Related: See "Multiple AND Conditions" section below
```

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably

RELIABILITY TIP (Discovered 2025-11-24):
While AND works in simple prompts, complex prompts (6+ filters) benefit from splitting:

❌ Less Reliable (in complex prompts):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5

✅ More Reliable (always parses):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25
Title area (acres): is less than 1.5

WHEN TO SPLIT:
- Complex prompts (6+ filters total)
- When other filters are failing to parse
- When you need guaranteed reliability

WHEN SINGLE LINE IS OK:
- Simple prompts (3-5 filters)
- When used alone or with minimal other filters
- Numeric ranges are the primary search criteria
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## SearchLand Presets - Case Study: Refining for Development

### "Preset #11 'Mixed use search' - Adding Scale & Constraint Filters"

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Stage 4 Validation)

CONTEXT:
User goal: Find 8-storey mixed-use development opportunities, £2M profit on £200k capital
Manual filters failed: 0 viable properties from 5 approaches
Pivot: Test SearchLand preset #11 "Mixed use search"

OBSERVATION:
Sample of 6 properties from base preset showed mixed results:
- 1/6 matched target profile (small-scale, low-rise, development opportunity)
- 5/6 were unsuitable (large institutional complexes, fully developed sites, complex ownership)

HYPOTHESIS:
Preset finds correct USE TYPE (mixed E/C3) but doesn't filter by:
- Scale (small vs. large sites)
- Development potential (low-rise vs. tall buildings)
- Ownership complexity (simple vs. multiple leaseholds)
- Planning constraints (clean vs. constrained sites)

EXPERIMENT:
Added 6 refinement filters to Preset #11 base:

1. SCALE FILTERS (to target manageable size):
   - Title area (acres): is greater than 0.04 AND less than 0.3
   - Addresses: is less than 8
   - Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3

2. DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL FILTERS (to target upside):
   - Max building height on title (m): is less than 8
     (Reasoning: Low-rise = airspace/intensification opportunity)
   - Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 50
     (Reasoning: Room for development/expansion)

3. CONSTRAINT FILTERS (to avoid planning blockers):
   - Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
     (Reasoning: These constraints made planning approval difficult in our specific use case)

RESULTS:
- Sample of 6 properties from refined preset: 6/6 matched target profile
  - All 0.04-0.22 acres (small-scale)
  - All 3.5-6.6m height (1-2 storeys with airspace potential)
  - All E/C3 mixed-use
  - All freehold or 1-2 leaseholds (simple ownership)

CONCLUSION FOR THIS SPECIFIC CASE:
Refinement filters improved viable property rate from 1/6 (17%) to 6/6 (100%) in this sample.

POTENTIAL APPLICABILITY:
If your goal is similar (small-scale development opportunities with airspace potential):
- Consider starting with a relevant preset
- Add filters for scale, potential, and constraints based on YOUR specific requirements
- Test on a sample before assuming broad applicability

IF YOUR GOAL IS DIFFERENT:
- Investment screening (operating assets): Preset as-is may be sufficient
- Large-scale projects: Adjust scale filters (e.g., 0.2-1.0 acres, <20 addresses)
- Airspace-specific: Add "Building has flat roof: Yes", reduce height to <6m
- Conversion plays: Remove height filter, add specific use class targeting

IMPORTANT CAVEATS:
- This is ONE case study (Preset #11, mixed-use development, Slough area)
- Sample size: 6 properties validated (not statistically significant)
- Other presets may behave differently
- Your requirements may need different refinements
- Test and validate for YOUR specific use case

## SearchLand Presets - Technical Filter Analysis

### "Number of EPC Records" Filter Behavior

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22)

TECHNICAL FACT:
"Number of EPC records on title: is greater than X" is a proxy for multi-unit buildings.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Each EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) = 1 unit (residential or commercial)
- "EPC > 10" = property has 10+ separate units
- "EPC > 50" = property has 50+ separate units

EXAMPLES WHERE THIS APPEARS:
- Preset #65 "Mixed use developments" (EPC > 10)
- Preset #61 "EV Charger Multi-Address" (targets apartment buildings)
- Preset #19 "Homes to HMO" (EPC-based filtering)

PROPERTIES RETURNED TYPICALLY HAVE:
- Multiple addresses (10-100+ for EPC > 10)
- Multiple leaseholds (if subdivided for sale/rent)
- Fully developed (already multi-unit, not single building)
- Complex ownership structures

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Using "EPC > X" filter will:
- ✅ Find existing multi-unit buildings (apartments, HMOs, multi-tenant commercial)
- ❌ Exclude single buildings (even if large floor area)
- ❌ Exclude undeveloped sites (no EPCs yet)
- ❌ Exclude properties with <X units

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → "Preset #11 vs #65 Comparison" for strategic use cases
```

### Preset Filter Reference (Mixed-Use)

```
PRESET #11 "MIXED USE SEARCH":
Base filters:
- Tenure: is one of Freehold
- Use class: contains any [E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)]
- Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
- Latest sold date: is after 01/08/2019

Characteristics:
- Broad search (any mixed-use property)
- Recent transactions only
- No scale, ownership, or EPC filters
- Very flexible (few built-in assumptions)

PRESET #65 "MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS":
Base filters:
- Tenure: is one of Freehold
- Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses, E - Commercial, Business and Service]
- Developed area (sqft): is between 5381.955 and 21527.821
- Ownership type: isn't one of [Corporate, Council, Housing Association]
- Number of EPC records on title: is greater than 10

Characteristics:
- Narrower search (specific size range: 500-2,000 sqmt)
- Excludes institutional ownership
- Targets existing multi-unit buildings (EPC > 10)
- Built-in assumptions about property type

For strategic comparison and use cases, see: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → "Comparing Similar Presets"

### Preset Filters - Common Missing Elements

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22)

TECHNICAL OBSERVATION:
Many SearchLand presets do not include filters for:
- Tenure (Freehold vs. Leasehold)
- Planning constraints (Green Belt, Flood Zones, Conservation Areas)
- Leasehold count

This means presets may return properties that are unsuitable for certain use cases.

EXAMPLES:

PRESET #19 "HOMES TO HMO":
Filters included:
- Tenure: Freehold ✅
- Use class: C3
- Number of addresses: 1
- Has an HMO: false
- Article 4: doesn't contain [restrictions]
- Ownership type: Company or Private owner
- Sales listing: false

Filter NOT included:
- Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt] ❌

Result: Returns Green Belt properties with 0% unconstrained

Sample (Slough, 3 properties tested):
- Property 1: 0.19 ac, 0% unconstrained, Strong Green Belt
- Property 2: 0.13 ac, 0% unconstrained, Strong Green Belt
- Property 3: 0.24 ac, 0% unconstrained, Strong Green Belt
- All in same geographic cluster (Little Sutton Lane area)

PRESET #20 "UNSOLD HOMES WITH POOR EPC":
Filters included:
- Ownership type: Company or Private owner
- Use class: C3
- Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ years)
- EPC rating: E, F, G

Filter NOT included:
- Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ❌

Result: Returns mix of Freehold and Leasehold properties

Sample (3 properties tested from base preset):
- Property 1: 0.0087 ac, Leasehold, 100% unconstrained
- Property 2: 0.12 ac, Freehold, 100% unconstrained
- Property 3: 0.049 ac, Freehold, 86.68% unconstrained
- 1/3 was Leasehold (unsuitable for development)

---

PRESET #47 "HMO OPPORTUNITIES":
Filters included:
- Tenure: Freehold ✅ (INCLUDED)
- Latest EPC habitable rooms: 8-12
- Use class: C3
- Latest sold date: before 26/11/2015 (10+ years)
- EPC rating: F, G, D, E
- Applications in last 5 years: <1
- Distance to Bus Stop: <500m
- Distance to Train Station: <1000m

Sample (6 properties tested):
- Property 1: 0.10 ac, 1 leasehold, 82.87% unconstrained, Company
- Property 2: 0.072 ac, 0 leaseholds, 100% unconstrained, Company
- Property 3: 0.27 ac, 0 leaseholds, 91.36% unconstrained, Private
- Property 4: 0.053 ac, 0 leaseholds, 100% unconstrained, Private
- Property 5: 0.09 ac, 0 leaseholds, 20.96% unconstrained, Private
- Property 6: 0.13 ac, 0 leaseholds, 100% unconstrained, Private
- 4/6 had clean ownership (0 leaseholds), 2/6 had complications

Observation: Even with Tenure: Freehold filter, "Number of leaseholds on the freehold" can be > 0

---

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Presets without tenure/constraint filters will return:
- Leaseholds mixed with Freeholds (if no tenure filter)
- Green Belt properties (if no planning constraint filter)
- Properties with leaseholders on freehold (if no leasehold count filter)

Users must manually add these filters if their use case requires:
- Development (needs Freehold, no Green Belt, clean ownership)
- Investment screening (may accept Leaseholds, constraints less critical)

### Preset Filters - Missing Size Constraints

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Preset testing continuation)

TECHNICAL OBSERVATION:
Many SearchLand presets lack both minimum AND maximum size constraints on "Title area (acres)".

EXAMPLES:

PRESET #20 "UNSOLD HOMES WITH POOR EPC" (Without size filter):
Base filters:
- Ownership type: Company or Private owner
- Use class: C3
- Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004
- EPC rating: E, F, G

Sample properties returned (without size filter):
- Property 5: 0.020 acres (871 sqft total plot) ❌ Too small
- Property 6: 0.0078 acres (340 sqft total plot) ❌ Microscopic
- Properties 1-3: 0.067-0.15 acres ✅ Workable

Viable rate (6 properties): 4/6 (67%) - 2 too small

After adding: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.5"
Sample (3 properties): 0.067-0.15 acres - all workable size
Viable rate: 3/3 (100%)

---

PRESET "AIRSPACE: COMMERCIAL, NO RESI" (Without size limit):
Base filters:
- Tenure: Freehold
- Use class: E or E(a)
- Developed area (sqft): ≥ 3229.173 (300 sqm)
- Developed area percentage: ≤ 30
- Flat roof: true
- No C3/C4

Sample properties returned (without size limit):
- Property 1: 2.98 acres (institutional scale, requires £2M+ capital) ❌
- Property 2: 11.67 acres (187,556 sqft developed, requires £10M+ capital) ❌
- Property 3: 0.27 acres (workable but 1 leasehold) ⚠️

Viable rate (3 properties): 0/3 (0%) - all too large or complex

Would benefit from: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5"

---

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Presets without size constraints will return:
- Micro-plots unsuitable for development (<0.05 acres = <2,178 sqft)
- Institutional-scale sites requiring £5M-£20M+ capital (>2 acres)

For £200k capital projects:
- Minimum viable: 0.05 acres (2,178 sqft)
- Maximum manageable: 0.5 acres (21,780 sqft)
- Optimal range: 0.1-0.3 acres

For institutional projects (£5M+):
- Minimum: 2 acres
- Typical: 5-20 acres

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → "Size Filters Are CRITICAL" for capital-based size recommendations

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```

## Newly Documented Filters (v5.2.3)

### Property Type

**Context:**
- Simple residential/commercial classification (different from "Property classification")
- Only 5 values: Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial
- Used for basic property type filtering

**Operators:** `contains all`, `contains any`, `does not contain`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property type: contains any [Detached, Semi-Detached]
Property type: contains all [Commercial, Flat]  // Mixed-use commercial flats
Property type: does not contain [Terraced]
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property type: Detached AND Semi-Detached
```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Do NOT confuse with "Property classification" (which has 500+ values)

---

### Tenure

**Context:**
- Legal ownership structure
- 5 values: Leasehold, Freehold, Pending first registration, Caution against first registration, Rentcharge
- Critical for acquisition strategy (Freehold = full ownership, Leasehold = time-limited)

**Operator:** `is one of` (implicit OR)

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Leasehold, Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Pending first registration]  // Unregistered land - potential opportunity
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'
❌ Tenure: NOT 'Leasehold'
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Freehold only:** For long-term hold/development (no ground rent complications)
- **Leasehold:** Can indicate motivated sellers (especially short leases <80 years)
- **Pending first registration:** Unregistered land - may have title issues but also opportunities

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Combine with "Lease end date" for leasehold properties to find short leases

---

### Property Classification

**Context:**
- Comprehensive taxonomy with ~500+ values across 24 major categories
- Separate from "Use class" (planning) - this is Ordnance Survey classification
- Hierarchical: Commercial > Hotel/Motel > Youth Hostel (example)
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT mix with "Use class" values

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**Major Categories:**
- Commercial, Education, Hotel/Motel, Industrial, Leisure, Medical, Animal Centre, Office, Broadcasting, Retail, Storage Land, Transport, Utility, Emergency/Rescue, Information, Land, Water, Military, Other, Parent Shell, Residential, Unclassified, Dual Use, Object of Interest

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property classification: contains any [Commercial, Residential]
Property classification: contains all [Development Site, Residential Construction Site]
Property classification: does not contain [Military, Prison]
Property classification: exactly matches [Hotel/Motel]
Property classification: contains any [Vacant / Derelict Land, Development Site]  // Opportunity sites
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property classification: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property classification: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]  // WRONG - that's Use class, not classification
❌ Property classification: Development Site AND Residential  // Use 'contains all' instead
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Development Site:** Active construction - may indicate market activity
- **Vacant / Derelict Land:** Potential redevelopment opportunities
- **Care / Nursing Home:** For care home conversion strategies
- **Hotel/Motel:** For hotel-to-residential conversions
- **Warehouse / Store / Storage Depot:** For industrial-to-residential conversions

**Performance/Notes:**
- Slower filter due to large value set - use strategically
- More granular than "Property type" but less planning-specific than "Use class"
- Can combine with "Use class" for precision (e.g., Classification: Hotel + Use class: C3 for converted hotels)

---

### PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level)

**Context:**
- London-specific metric (Transport for London)
- 9 values: 0 (Worst), 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)
- Higher = better public transport access = higher land values + planning support for density
- **CRITICAL:** Only available in London - will return zero results elsewhere

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
PTAL: contains any [6a, 6b (Best)]  // Excellent transport - supports tall buildings
PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]  // Good to excellent
PTAL: does not contain [0 (Worst), 1a, 1b]  // Exclude poor transport areas
PTAL: exactly matches [6b (Best)]  // Only the very best
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ PTAL: '6a' OR '6b'
❌ PTAL: is greater than 4  // Not a numeric filter - use 'contains any' with list
❌ PTAL: High  // Must use exact values (0, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b)
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **High-density development:** PTAL 4+ supports planning for tall buildings
- **Residential demand:** PTAL 5+ = premium pricing for car-free living
- **Planning policy:** Many London boroughs require PTAL 3+ for car-free developments
- **Opportunity:** PTAL 2-3 areas with planned transport improvements (check TfL plans)

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- **London only** - always combine with London geography filters
- Use with "Distance to nearest Train Station" for non-London areas
- PTAL ratings can change - check TfL website for planned improvements

**Related Filters:**
- Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - for non-London areas
- Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m)
- Distance to nearest Rapid Transit Stop/Station (m)

---

### Planning Constraints

**Context:**
- 34 constraint types covering environmental, heritage, policy, and flood risk
- Critical for assessing development viability
- Some are absolute blockers (Green Belt, SSSI), others provide policy support (Housing Zones)
- **IMPORTANT:** "Built up areas" is POSITIVE (urban context), not a constraint to avoid

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (34 constraints)
- **Absolute Blockers:** Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, World heritage sites, Scheduled Monuments, National Parks, National Landscapes (AONB)
- **Flood Risk:** Flood Zone 2 (negotiable), Flood Zone 3 (major blocker)
- **Policy Support (SEEK):** Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas, Areas Of Intensification, Site Allocations, Built up areas
- **Heritage:** Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer (less restrictive), Parks and Gardens, Battlefields
- **Environmental:** SAC, SPA, RAMSAR, National Nature Reserves, Local Nature Reserves, Country Parks, CROW
- **Urban Planning:** Central Activities Zone (London), SIL, LSIS, Town Center Boundaries, Designated Open Space
- **Other:** Tree Preservation Order (TPO), Nutrient Neutrality

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]  // Avoid major blockers
Planning constraints: contains any [Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas]  // Seek policy support
Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Exclude protected sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Housing Zones, Built up areas]  // Urban housing policy areas
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]  // Exclude Green Belt only
Planning constraints: contains any [Site Allocations]  // Sites allocated for development in local plan
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Planning constraints: NOT 'Green Belt'
❌ Planning constraints: 'Green Belt' OR 'Conservation Area'
❌ Planning constraints: does not contain [Built up areas]  // WRONG - Built up areas is GOOD!
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Urban Brownfield Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
   ```

2. **High-Density Development (London):**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [Central Activities Zone, Opportunity Areas]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
   ```

3. **Avoid All Major Blockers:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   ```

4. **Industrial Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [SIL, LSIS]  // Strategic/Locally Significant Industrial - may be released
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
   ```

5. **Flood Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3]  // Exclude high risk
   Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 2]  // Accept Zone 2 (mitigation possible)
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Use "Percentage of plot un-constrained" to find sites with minimal coverage (e.g., >80%)
- **Critical distinction:** "Built up areas" = urban context (GOOD), NOT a development blocker
- Green Belt = ~13% of England - major constraint but some brownfield exceptions exist
- Conservation Areas = ~2% of England - design restrictions, not necessarily a blocker
- Flood Zone 3 = high risk - insurance issues, planning refusal likely
- Flood Zone 2 = medium risk - mitigation measures required but achievable

**Related Filters:**
- Percentage of plot un-constrained (%) - Find sites with <20% constraint coverage
- Area of plot un-constrained (acres) - Absolute unconstrained area
- Percentage of title covered by Green Belt - Partial coverage may be workable
- Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2/3 - Assess flood risk extent

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Clean sites for quick planning
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80

# Policy-supported urban sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]

# Heritage-adjacent (not on-site)
Planning constraints: contains any [Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Near but not on
```

---

### Building Use Group

**Context:**
- High-level functional classification - 17 categories
- Less granular than "Use class" (planning), more functional than "Property type"
- Good for broad filtering before applying detailed "Use class" filters
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly listed as a category (unlike in Property type)

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (17 categories)
- **Commercial:** Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing, Commercial Activity: Other
- **Residential:** Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation
- **Public Services:** Education, Government Services, Medical or Emergency Services
- **Infrastructure:** Transport, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Construction
- **Other:** Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Attraction Sports or Activity, Religious Worship and Funeral Services, Mixed Use, Unknown

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other]
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection]
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // All residential types
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail]  // Retail focus
Building use group: does not contain [Unknown]  // Exclude unclear properties
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Building use group: 'Mixed Use' OR 'Commercial'
❌ Building use group: NOT 'Agriculture'
❌ Building use group: contains any [C3, E]  // WRONG - those are Use class values, not Building use group
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Broad Commercial Search:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]
   ```

2. **Exclude Non-Development Sites:**
   ```
   Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
   ```

3. **Mixed-Use Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
   // Then refine with specific Use class filters
   ```

4. **Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // Hotels to residential
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]  // Industrial to residential
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Good for initial broad filtering, then refine with "Use class"
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly tagged - useful for precedent-based searches
- "Unknown" category exists - may want to exclude or investigate separately
- More intuitive than "Use class" codes but less planning-specific

**Relationship to Other Filters:**
- **Broader than:** Use class (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Narrower than:** Property type (Detached, Commercial, etc.)
- **Different from:** Property classification (OS taxonomy)

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Broad commercial search, then refine
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other]
Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]

# Residential focus with mixed-use
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Mixed Use]
Property type: contains any [Flat, Commercial]

# Exclude unsuitable for development
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
```

Loaded cached credentials.
Here is the validation of each approach based on the provided documents.

### Claude - Approach A: Class MA Arbitrage

**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The business case is sound and the capital plan is feasible with phased funding. However, the approach is not technically valid as written due to a critical syntax error in the prompt.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Invalid Syntax:** Line 4, `NOT: Use class contains [C3]`, is incorrect. As per `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`, the `NOT` operator is not used this way.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Change line 4 to the correct syntax: `Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]`

---

### Claude - Approach B: Class Q Agricultural Conversion

**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The business case is strong, leveraging a known high-uplift strategy (agricultural to residential). The capital plan, which uses a standard bridging loan for conversion costs, is a viable and common industry practice. The upfront acquisition cost fits within the user's £200k capital.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Minor Syntax Anomaly:** Line 6, `Building on title is derelict: does not equal Yes`, uses a non-standard operator. While it might be parsed, the standard is `is equal to No`. This is a low-severity issue but should be corrected for consistency.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Change line 6 to: `Building on title is derelict: is equal to No`

---

### Claude - Approach C: Mixed-Use Airspace Development

**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The business case is strong, employing a capital-efficient structure (acquiring rights, not the whole building) that is standard for airspace development. The user's upfront capital (£50k-£105k) is within their budget. However, the prompt contains two non-existent filter names and will fail to execute.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Incorrect Filter Name:** Line 6, `Building has flat roof: Yes`. The correct filter name is `A building in the title has flat roof`, per `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`.
*   **Incorrect Filter Name:** Line 8, `Addresses: is less than 8`. The correct filter name is `Number of addresses`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Change line 6 to: `A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes`
*   Change line 8 to: `Number of addresses: is less than 8`

---

### Claude - Approach D: HMO Volume

**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a well-documented, viable strategy for building a rental portfolio. The use of refinancing to "recycle" capital is a standard and effective industry practice (the "BRRRR" method). The capital required for the first property is within budget, enabling the cascade.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Incorrect Filter Value:** Line 10, `Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Direction - HMO]`, uses a value that is not listed in `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`. The correct approach is to use the dedicated `Article 4` filter.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Remove line 10 and add a new filter: `Article 4: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]` (assuming the goal is to avoid all Article 4 areas).

---

### Codex - Approach A: MA Freehold Micro-Conversions

**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically invalid because it relies on a non-existent filter (`Local planning authority`). The search cannot be geographically anchored as written and will fail. Additionally, it lacks a worked ROI calculation, making the business case incomplete.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Non-existent Filter:** Line 1, `Local planning authority: is Brentwood`, is not a valid filter in SearchLand.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Remove the `Local planning authority` filter and instead perform the search across a wider area, then manually filter or sort the results by LPA, or use the `Neighbouring Local Planning Authorities of` filter if applicable.
*   Add an explicit ROI calculation (GDV, costs, net profit) to validate the business case.

---

### Codex - Approach B: Large Low-EPC Houses to HMO

**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically invalid. It uses a non-existent filter name (`Article 4 HMO`) and an incorrect filter name for `Addresses`. The prompt will fail.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Non-existent Filter:** Line 5, `Article 4 HMO: does not contain Article 4`. The correct filter is named `Article 4` or `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions`.
*   **Incorrect Filter Name:** Line 4, `Addresses: is equal to 1`. The correct filter name is `Number of addresses`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Change line 4 to: `Number of addresses: is equal to 1`
*   Change line 5 to: `Article 4: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]`

### Gemini - Approach A: Class MA Arbitrage (Low Capital Refinement)

**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is logical, but the prompt is technically flawed due to incorrect boolean syntax. More importantly, the combination of filters (low price, small size, on-market, freehold, specific use class) is so restrictive that it is highly likely to return zero results, making the approach practically unviable.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Invalid Syntax:** Line 8, `Sales listing currently on the market: Yes`. The correct syntax for boolean filters is `is equal to Yes`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Correct the syntax in line 8 to `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes`.
*   To improve viability, consider broadening the filters, such as increasing the `Sales listing price` cap or including off-market properties by removing the "on market" filter and relying on other motivation signals.

### Gemini - Approach B: Vacant Commercial Conversion (Lease Expiry Arbitrage)

**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The off-market business strategy is excellent and demonstrates strong domain knowledge. However, the prompt contains technical flaws (incorrect boolean syntax and use of natural language) that will prevent it from running correctly.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Invalid Syntax:** Line 5, `Sales listing currently on the market: No`. The correct syntax is `is equal to No`.
*   **Natural Language Used:** Line 9, `Less than 1 application in last 5 years`. This should be the formal filter syntax.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Change line 5 to: `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No`
*   Change line 9 to: `Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1`

### Grok - Approach B: Infill Development Opportunities

**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically invalid due to a critical omission. It fails to filter for the initial `Use class`, which is the foundation of the strategy. As written, it would search for infill opportunities on all property types, not just the intended residential (C3) sites, leading to irrelevant results.

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Missing Critical Filter:** The prompt is missing the core filter `Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]` which is necessary to target residential properties for infill.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Add the following line to the prompt: `Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]`

### Grok - Approach C: Grey Belt Workaround Conversions

**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The business strategy is a sophisticated and valid niche play. However, the prompt is technically flawed as it uses a non-existent filter name for "Hardstanding percentage".

**Technical Issues:**
*   **Incorrect Filter Name:** Line 3, `Hardstanding percentage: is greater than 25`. As per `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`, the correct filter is `Percentage of title covered by hard standings`.

**Suggested Fixes:**
*   Change line 3 to: `Percentage of title covered by hard standings: is greater than 25`
