### Claude - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Syntax error in filter 4 invalidates the search, but capital is feasible with phased deployment and ROI is achievable through Class MA conversions.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Invalid syntax: "NOT: Use class contains [C3 - Dwellinghouses]" should be "Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]".
- "Freehold tenure" should be "Tenure: is one of [Freehold]".

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct syntax as noted; units (sqft, acres) are accurate.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Strong focus on permitted development reduces risk.

### Claude - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Invalid filter names prevent accurate searching, but capital fits with bridging finance and ROI is highly achievable via Class Q conversions.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Agricultural Land Grade" does not exist; correct is "Agricultural land classification".
- "Property classification: contains any [Agricultural, Farm, Horticulture]" uses incorrect values; "Agricultural" is a category but "Farm" and "Horticulture" are not listed as separate filters.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Use "Agricultural land classification: contains any [Grade 3, Grade 3a, Grade 3b, Grade 4, Grade 5]"; verify property classification values against reference.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Agricultural conversions offer high profit potential but require structural expertise.

### Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Invalid filter names block execution, but capital is feasible with development finance and ROI is realistic for airspace development.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Building has flat roof: Yes" should be "A building in the title has flat roof: Yes".
- "Addresses: is less than 8" should be "Number of addresses: is less than 8".

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct filter names as noted; all other filters and units are valid.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Airspace strategy minimizes upfront capital but involves complex negotiations.

### Claude - Approach D: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Invalid filter name hinders search, but capital works with refinancing and ROI is viable through HMO cashflow.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Direction - HMO]" uses invalid value; correct is "Article 4" or "Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0".

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Use "Article 4: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]" or equivalent percentage filter.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Volume HMO approach suits cashflow focus with refinance scaling.

### Codex - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Invalid filters prevent geography anchoring, but capital is feasible and ROI is achievable for MA conversions.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Local planning authority: is Brentwood" does not exist; no direct proxy for LPA in filters.
- "Preset: equals Class MA eligible commercial sites" is not a valid filter (presets are not filterable).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Remove invalid filters; use "Neighbouring Local Planning Authorities of: contains Brentwood" if available, or manual geography check.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Micro-conversions align with low capital but require clean freehold titles.

### Codex - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Invalid filters and names block execution, but capital fits and ROI is viable for HMO conversions.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Local planning authority: is Brentwood" does not exist.
- "Preset: equals Run down homes" is not a valid filter.
- "Addresses: is equal to 1" should be "Number of addresses: is equal to 1".
- "Article 4 HMO: does not contain Article 4" uses invalid filter; correct is "Article 4" or percentage equivalent.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct filter names as noted; remove preset reference.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- EPC-driven motivation is strong for regulation-based deals.

### Gemini - Approach A: VALID

### Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Syntax error invalidates search, but capital fits and ROI is feasible via lease expiry arbitrage.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" uses natural language; correct is "Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1".

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct to proper SearchLand syntax.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Off-market lease expiry creates strong motivation.

### Grok - Approach A: VALID
