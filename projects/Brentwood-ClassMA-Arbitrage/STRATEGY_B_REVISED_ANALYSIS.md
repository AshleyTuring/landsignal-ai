# Strategy B: Revised Analysis - Expired License Opportunities

**Date:** 2024-12-04  
**Status:** 3 PRIVATE OWNER properties found ✅

---

## ✅ You Were Right: Leasehold CAN Be An Opportunity

### The Arbitrage Play:

**Scenario: Buying leasehold HMO with expired license**

**Why it's CHEAP:**
1. Expired license = non-compliant = can't legally rent
2. Owner facing fines (up to £30k)
3. Must shut down or spend £5k-£15k to relicense + upgrade
4. Motivated to sell quickly
5. Leaseholds already trade at 10-20% discount vs freehold

**Purchase Price:** £80k-£120k (30-40% below market due to distress + leasehold + expired license)

**Fix Costs:**
- Relicense: £1,500
- EPC upgrades (if needed): £3,000-£8,000
- Fire safety compliance: £2,000-£5,000
- Minor refurb: £3,000-£5,000
- **Total fix:** £10k-£20k

**Total Investment:** £90k-£140k ✅ WELL UNDER £200k budget

**Exit Strategy 1: Operate**
- Market rent: £2,000-£2,500/month
- Minus ground rent: -£300-£500/year
- Minus service charges: -£500-£1,000/year
- Net income: £22k-£28k/year
- **Yield on £120k:** 18-23% 🔥

**Exit Strategy 2: Refinance**
- Post-compliance value: £140k-£180k (leasehold, licensed, operational)
- Refinance at 75% LTV: £105k-£135k
- **Cash extracted:** £0-£15k (if you paid £120k)
- Keep for cashflow: £22k-£28k/year

**Exit Strategy 3: Quick Flip**
- Buy at £100k (distressed)
- Fix for £15k
- Sell at £140k-£160k (licensed, operational leasehold)
- **Profit:** £25k-£45k in 3-6 months

## 🎯 Strategy B Results: 3 Private Owner Properties

### Property 1: 3 Hamblets, Loughton (Epping Forest)
**Ownership:** Private owner (not corporate)
**Status:** Expired HMO license
**Key Details:**
- Use class: Mixed (C3 + other)
- Development/planning applications present
- Allocated plan status
- Settlement within built area

**Initial Assessment:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Private owner = actual operator with expired license
- Mixed use = potential complexity but also opportunity
- Planning applications = owner tried to do something, may be tired

**Next Steps:**
1. Check exact license expiry date
2. Check lease length remaining (critical for leasehold)
3. Check ground rent + service charges
4. Estimate fix costs for compliance
5. Research owner via Land Registry

---

### Property 2: 163-165 New Road, Chelmsford (C2, C3, C4)
**Ownership:** Private owner
**Status:** Expired HMO license
**Key Details:**
- Multiple use classes (C2 residential institution, C3 dwelling, C4 HMO)
- Mix of residential types
- Chelmsford location (good rental demand)

**Initial Assessment:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Multiple use classes = potentially large building
- C4 already designated = HMO planning established
- Private owner with expired license = motivated

**Next Steps:**
1. Check if freehold or leasehold
2. Check building size (how many units?)
3. Check current occupancy status
4. Estimate relicensing requirements
5. Potential for larger profit if multi-unit

---

### Property 3: 69 Parklands Drive, Chelmsford (C2, C3, C4)
**Ownership:** Private owner
**Status:** Expired HMO license
**Key Details:**
- Use classes: C2, C3, C4 (like Property 2)
- Chelmsford location
- Development grounds classification

**Initial Assessment:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Similar profile to Property 2
- Private owner = operator
- Chelmsford = strong rental market

**Next Steps:**
1. Check if this is near Property 2 (same street/area?)
2. Check freehold vs leasehold
3. Check building size
4. Potential for bulk approach if same owner as Property 2?

---

## Critical Questions to Research (Before Approaching)

### For Each Property:

**1. Tenure Check:**
- Is it freehold or leasehold?
- If leasehold, how many years remaining?
- Ground rent amount?
- Service charges?

**2. License Details:**
- When did license expire?
- Why did it expire? (owner forgot to renew? failed inspection?)
- How many households licensed for?
- Previous license holder name

**3. Owner Research:**
- Individual or company name
- How long have they owned it?
- Do they own other HMOs? (via "Number of titles owned")
- Any financial distress signals?

**4. Property Condition:**
- Current EPC rating
- Fire safety compliance status
- Any enforcement notices?
- Estimated fix costs

**5. Financial Modeling:**
- Estimated purchase price (considering distress)
- Fix costs
- Market rent (per room)
- Ground rent + service charges (if leasehold)
- Exit value (licensed, operational)

## Leasehold vs Freehold Strategy

### If FREEHOLD (Best Case):
- Buy at £120k-£160k (distressed)
- Fix for £10k-£20k
- Total: £130k-£180k
- **Profit potential:** £80k-£120k (refinance + hold OR flip)

### If LEASEHOLD with 80+ years (Good Case):
- Buy at £80k-£120k (leasehold discount + distress)
- Fix for £10k-£20k
- Total: £90k-£140k ✅
- **Profit potential:** £50k-£80k (operate for cashflow OR flip)
- **Key:** Ground rent + service charges must be reasonable (<£2k/year)

### If LEASEHOLD with 50-80 years (Proceed with Caution):
- Buy at £60k-£100k (heavy discount)
- Fix for £10k-£20k
- Lease extension needed: £10k-£30k (depends on remaining term)
- Total: £80k-£150k
- **Profit potential:** £30k-£60k
- **Risk:** Lease extension negotiations, lender restrictions

### If LEASEHOLD with <50 years (Avoid):
- Lease too short for mortgage refinancing
- Would need cash purchase + immediate lease extension
- Too complex for first deal

## Recommended Approach for Strategy B

### Week 1: Deep Dive Research (10-15 hours)

**Day 1-2: Data Gathering**
- Order Land Registry title documents for all 3 (£3 each = £9)
- Check HMO license register for each LPA:
  - Epping Forest for Property 1
  - Chelmsford for Properties 2 & 3
- Document exact license expiry dates, holder names
- Check if freehold or leasehold for each

**Day 3: Financial Modeling**
- Create spreadsheet for each property
- Model 3 scenarios: Best, Base, Worst case
- Calculate maximum purchase price for £150k profit target
- Identify deal-breakers (e.g., <50yr lease, £5k/yr ground rent)

**Day 4-5: Preliminary Valuation**
- Research comparable sales in area (licensed HMOs, similar size)
- Research rental comps (per room rates)
- Estimate GDV (licensed, operational)
- Estimate distressed purchase price (30-40% discount)

### Week 2: Outreach (5-8 hours)

**Approach Strategy:**

**Letter Template (Off-Market Direct Approach):**

```
Dear [Owner Name],

I am a property investor based in Essex specializing in HMO properties. 

I understand that [Address] may have licensing considerations that need addressing. I'm interested in purchasing the property in its current condition and taking on the responsibility of bringing it into compliance.

I can move quickly with cash/mortgage ready and would welcome a discussion about a straightforward sale at a fair price that reflects the current situation.

If you're interested in exploring this, please contact me at [phone/email].

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Non-threatening ("licensing considerations" not "you're breaking the law")
- Positions you as solution ("I'll take the problem")
- Speed + certainty ("cash ready, quick close")
- Fair price expectation (not lowball)

**Follow-up:**
- Send letter Monday
- Wait 5-7 days
- Follow up with phone call (if number available)
- Offer to meet at property for viewing

### Week 3-4: Negotiation + Due Diligence

**Target Purchase Prices (adjust based on research):**

- **Freehold:** £120k-£160k (aim for 30% below market)
- **Leasehold (80+ years):** £80k-£120k (40% below market)
- **Leasehold (50-80 years):** £60k-£100k (50% below market)

**Due Diligence Checklist:**
- Full survey (structural, damp, fire safety)
- HMO license requirements consultation (local authority)
- Planning check (any enforcement notices?)
- Leasehold terms review (if applicable)
- Tenant situation (any sitting tenants? tenancy agreements?)
- Insurance quote (HMO insurance)
- Mortgage offer (if financing)

## When to Update Executive Summary

**DO NOT UPDATE YET**

**Wait until:**
1. ✅ You've researched all 3 properties (Land Registry, licenses)
2. ✅ You've confirmed freehold/leasehold status
3. ✅ You've modeled financials
4. ✅ You've sent outreach letters
5. ✅ You've received 1+ response

**THEN update Executive Summary with:**
- New Approach: Expired License Arbitrage (Strategy B results)
- Document the 3 properties
- Document the leasehold opportunity insight
- Document why you're pursuing this vs other approaches

**Timeline:** Update Executive Summary in 1-2 weeks after initial responses

---

## Status Update

**Strategy A:** ❌ ABANDONED (banks, not landlords)

**Strategy B:** ✅ VIABLE - 3 private owner properties with expired licenses
- High motivation (compliance pressure)
- Potential for 30-50% purchase discount
- Leasehold could be opportunity (if terms reasonable)
- Next step: Deep research on all 3

**Strategy C:** ⏸️ ON HOLD (until Strategy B researched)
- Still valid as backup
- 66,138 base properties
- Can pivot if Strategy B doesn't yield responses

---

**Recommendation:** Focus 100% on Strategy B research for next 2-3 days. These 3 properties are REAL opportunities.
