## 🔥 LIVE OPPORTUNITY: Weir Road Dual Liquidation Portfolio

**CYMBA LTD just entered Members Voluntary Liquidation on 28 October 2025 (2 months ago!)** - this is now a complete portfolio liquidation!

### Combined Portfolio GDV Analysis:

**Property 1: 10-12 Weir Road, Balham (Title SGL241433)**
- Owner: CYMBA LTD (12354333) - **IN LIQUIDATION (28 Oct 2025)**
- Developed Area: 6,474 sqft
- Land: 0.45 acres
- Build %: 32.7%

**Property 2: 8 Weir Road, Balham (Title SZ78987)**
- Owner: CYPRBA LTD (12534433) - **IN LIQUIDATION (22 Apr 2020)**
- Developed Area: 14,153 sqft
- Land: 0.45 acres
- Build %: 72.2%

**COMBINED PORTFOLIO:**
- Total Developed Area: **20,627 sqft**
- Total Land: **0.9 acres**
- Both Liquidators: Same practitioners (7th Floor, 21 Lombard Street)

### GDV Scenarios (Class MA Residential Conversion):

| Scenario | £/sqft | Total GDV | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Conservative | £1,000 | **£20.6M** | Balham industrial, standard finish |
| Mid-Range | £1,200 | **£24.8M** | Good refurb, local comparables |
| Optimistic | £1,500 | **£30.9M** | Luxury finish, Zone 2 pricing |

### Deal Economics (Mid-Range Scenario):

**GDV:** £24.8M

**Costs:**
- Acquisition: £5-8M (liquidation discount)
- Conversion: £4-5M (£200-250/sqft luxury)
- **Lease Buyout: £1-2M+** (Travis Perkins negotiation)
- Fees/contingency: £1-1.5M
- **Total Cost: £11-16.5M**

**Returns:**
- **Gross Profit: £8-14M**
- **ROI: 50-100%**

### 🚨 THE LEASEHOLD ISSUE REMAINS:

Property 2 has **Travis Perkins with 14 years remaining** - this kills the deal unless:

1. Liquidator negotiates lease surrender with Travis Perkins
2. You buy both properties at massive discount (60-70% off) to compensate for lease buyout cost
3. Lease buyout cost: £1-2M+ (Travis Perkins won't leave cheap)

**Net Effect:** Reduces profit by £1-2M minimum

### The Opportunity:

This is a **dual liquidation portfolio sale** - same practitioners handling both companies. They'll likely package it together. The fact CYMBA just entered liquidation (Oct 2025) means this is a **fresh opportunity that others haven't found yet!**

**Key Learnings:**
1. "In Administration" filter doesn't work - use "Liquidation" only
2. ALWAYS add leasehold filter: `Number of leaseholds < 1` is CRITICAL
3. Related company setups (same incorporation date/address) indicate portfolio plays
4. Recent liquidations (Oct 2025) = fresh opportunity window

**Recommendation:** Re-run search with `Number of leaseholds < 1` to find truly viable opportunities
