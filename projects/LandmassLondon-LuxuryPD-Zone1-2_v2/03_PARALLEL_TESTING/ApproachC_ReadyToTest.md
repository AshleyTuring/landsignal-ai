# **APPROACH C: Airspace Title Simplicity (Unbroken Freeholds)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Airspace Development + Title Simplicity  
**Capital Required:** £5.5M-£16M (airspace £5M-£15M + fees £500k-£1M)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (Zone 1-2)

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Max building height (m): is less than 12
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Sales listing price: is between 5000000 and 20000000
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

## **Rationale**
Focuses on structural simplicity to reduce airspace negotiation risk. "Number of leaseholds < 1" (unbroken freehold) means a single owner controls the entire building, eliminating rooftop rights negotiation with multiple leaseholders. Lower height threshold (<12m = 3-4 storeys) targets older, under-built stock where adding 1-3 floors is most feasible. Smaller ticket (<£20M) provides more deal flow in Zone 2 and edge Zone 1.

**Critique Integration:** Pattern 23A (title simplicity) applied; added planning constraints exclusion; price band targets accessible entry points.

## **Strengths**
- **Simple negotiation:** Single freeholder (no leaseholder complications)
- **Lower capital:** £5M-£20M entry point (more deal opportunities)
- **Clear ownership:** Unbroken title reduces legal complexity
- **Quick execution:** Simpler structure accelerates timeline
- **Post-1970 frames:** Lower buildings often concrete (good structural capacity)

## **Limitations**
- **Lower GDV:** Zone 2 focus means £1,000-£2,000/sqft (vs £2,000-£4,000 Zone 1)
- **Structural capacity:** Still requires desktop study (not all frames suitable)
- **Rights of light:** Risk remains (neighboring properties)
- **Lender appetite:** Some lenders cautious on airspace deals

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run preset in Zone 2 LPAs (Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Hackney, Islington)
2. **Title verification:** Check Land Registry for unbroken freeholds (single owner)
3. **Owner approach:** Direct outreach with airspace proposal
4. **Structural desktop:** Desktop study on top 10 (prioritize post-1970)
5. **Option agreement:** Secure airspace rights (£100k-£300k)
6. **Planning application:** 1-3 additional storeys
7. **Construction:** Offsite manufacture + quick install
8. **Exit:** £1,000-£2,000/sqft for new floors (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £300k-£2M (negotiated with single freeholder)
- **Structural works:** £180-£250/sqft shell & core (£800k-£3M for 1-3 floors)
- **Planning & technical:** £300k-£800k (structural, daylight, fees)
- **Construction:** £1.5M-£6M (1-3 floors at 1,500-4,000 sqft each)
- **Total:** £2.9M-£11.8M
- **Expected margin:** 20-30% (blended across new floors)
