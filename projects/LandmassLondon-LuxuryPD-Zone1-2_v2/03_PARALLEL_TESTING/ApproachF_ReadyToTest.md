**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Office-to-Residential + Triple Motivation  
**Capital Required:** £11M-£52M (acquisition £8M-£40M + conversion £3M-£12M)  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties (Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #68 "Offices with no C3 and no lease"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
2. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
3. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
4. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
5. Company status: is one of [Active]
6. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
```

## **Rationale**
Stacks three motivations for maximum seller pressure: (1) vacant office (no income + carrying costs), (2) low EPC (cannot rent until upgraded = £50k-£200k cost), (3) long hold >15 years (trapped equity + tired ownership). PTAL 4-6b ensures Zone 1-2 locations with policy support for residential conversion. Vacant offices are Class MA eligible (E(g)(i) use class) with no tenant complications.

**Critique Integration:** Triple motivation creates compounding pressure; PTAL filter ensures Zone 1-2; active company status avoids dissolved entity complications.

## **Strengths**
- **Triple motivation:** Vacant (no income) + low EPC (can't rent) + long hold (tired)
- **Immediate possession:** Vacant = no tenant negotiations or wait periods
- **Proven PD route:** Class MA for offices is established path
- **Scale buildings:** 10,000+ sqft = 20-100 luxury units
- **Policy support:** PTAL 4-6b areas favor residential conversion

## **Limitations**
- **Carrying costs:** Vacant for you during conversion too (finance burden)
- **Deferred maintenance:** Vacant often indicates neglect (survey critical)
- **Weak office market:** Helps acquisition, but limits alternative exits
- **MEP costs:** Low EPC may indicate major systems replacement needed

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in Zone 1-2 LPAs with PTAL 4-6b
2. **Motivation screening:** Prioritize true vacancy (not temporarily empty)
3. **Owner approach:** "Your vacant office costs £X/month + needs £100k EPC upgrade"
4. **Offer strategy:** 15-20% below market (stack all three motivations)
5. **Survey:** Structural + M&E assessment (£15k-£30k)
6. **Class MA prior approval:** 56 days statutory timeline
7. **Refurbishment:** Luxury residential fit-out (£150-£250/sqft Zone 1, £100-£180/sqft Zone 2)
8. **Exit:** 20-100 flats at £1,500-£3,500/sqft depending on zone

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £8M-£40M (15-20% discount = £1.4M-£8M margin creation)
- **Conversion:** £3M-£12M (luxury fit-out for 20-100 units)
- **Fees & contingency:** £1M-£4M
- **Total:** £12M-£56M
- **Expected margin:** 22-32% (stacked motivations + refurb value-add)
