**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND is less than 60000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND is less than 50000
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
4. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
5. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
6. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
```

## **Rationale**
Stacks two time-pressure motivations: expiring leases (income cliff within 2 years) and liquidation (forced sale). Larger buildings (10,000-50,000 sqft) in Zone 1 price band create institutional-scale opportunities with airspace upside. Low-rise (<15m) with high un-constrained percentage ensures clean airspace development path. Liquidation + lease expiry creates urgent exit need, supporting 20-30% acquisition discount.

**Critique Integration:** Added un-constrained percentage for planning confidence; dual motivation creates compounding seller pressure.

## **Strengths**
- **Dual motivation:** Lease expiry (income loss) + liquidation (forced sale)
- **Institutional scale:** £10M-£60M targets larger opportunities
- **Zone 1 GDV:** £2,000-£4,000/sqft on new airspace floors
- **Planning confidence:** >70% un-constrained + low-rise = approval likelihood
- **Distressed pricing:** 20-30% discount potential from dual pressure

## **Limitations**
- **Higher capital:** £24M-£85M total requires significant equity/debt
- **Zone 1 competition:** More institutional buyers active
- **Structural risk:** Large buildings may have complex load paths
- **Quick decisions:** Liquidation + lease expiry = compressed timeline

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, Camden, City, K&C)
2. **Liquidator contact:** Immediate approach (6-12 months pre-lease expiry = peak pressure)
3. **Desktop analysis:** Structural capacity + lease review
4. **Offer strategy:** 20-25% below market (factor in dual motivations)
5. **Structural survey:** Detailed assessment (£20k-£50k)
6. **Airspace planning:** 3-5 additional storeys
7. **Refurbishment:** Luxury fit-out for base building + new floors
8. **Exit:** Blended £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £15M-£60M (20-25% discount)
- **Airspace construction:** £5M-£15M (3-5 floors)
- **Refurbishment:** £4M-£10M (luxury fit-out)
- **Fees & contingency:** £2M-£5M
- **Total:** £26M-£90M
- **Expected margin:** 20-30% (distressed acquisition + airspace value-add)
