# **APPROACH E: QSR/Retail Lease Expiry (Dual PD Paths)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Lease Expiry + Change of Use Conversion  
**Capital Required:** £7.6M-£19M (acquisition £7M-£18M + conversion £600k-£1M)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (Zone 2)

**START WITH PRESET:** #17 "Commercial with expiring leases"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Use class: is one of [E(b), E]
2. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000
4. Sales listing price: is between 5000000 and 20000000
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets QSR/retail/office hybrids (E(b)/E use classes) with imminent lease expiry (within 2 years = income cliff). Expiring branded covenants create landlord motivation (void risk + re-letting costs). Larger units (>5,000 sqft) support 20-40 residential units via Class MA conversion or Class ZA demolish/rebuild. Dual PD paths increase optionality. Zone 2 price band (£5M-£20M) provides deal flow.

**Critique Integration:** E(b) targets branded QSR units; dual PD paths (MA or ZA) provide fallback; excluded conservation for clean planning.

## **Strengths**
- **Time-based motivation:** Lease expiry = approaching income cliff
- **Branded units:** Often over-rented (market rent rebase opportunity)
- **Dual PD routes:** Class MA (conversion) or Class ZA (rebuild) = flexibility
- **Good locations:** Retail units typically high-street/transport hubs
- **No distress stigma:** Lease expiry is business-as-usual event

## **Limitations**
- **Renewal rights:** Some leases may have tenant options (check lease terms)
- **Contamination:** Former kitchens require environmental assessment
- **Signage/rights:** Must clear third-party rights and advertising
- **Competition:** Lease expiry is public info (other buyers aware)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in Zone 2 LPAs (Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Hackney)
2. **Lease analysis:** Export results, prioritize leases expiring in 3-12 months
3. **Landlord approach:** "Avoid void + re-letting costs, we exchange now"
4. **Dual appraisal:** Model both MA conversion and ZA rebuild (choose best margin)
5. **Offer strategy:** 10-15% below market (factor in void risk premium)
6. **Environmental survey:** Former kitchen areas (£5k-£10k)
7. **Prior approval:** Class MA or ZA (56 days)
8. **Conversion/rebuild:** £140-£210/sqft for residential fit-out
9. **Exit:** £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £7M-£18M (10-15% discount)
- **Conversion/rebuild:** £600k-£1M (strip/refit or shell)
- **Fees & contingency:** £400k-£800k
- **Total:** £8M-£19.8M
- **Expected margin:** 18-28% (lease-event discount + change-of-use uplift)
