# **APPROACH A: Class MA Liquidation Plays (Comprehensive)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Class MA PD + Forced Sale Motivation  
**Capital Required:** £12M-£68M (acquisition £10M-£60M + refurb £2M-£8M)  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 60000000
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND less than 100000
4. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

## **Rationale**
Combines the strongest possible seller motivation (liquidation = legally obligated to sell) with the lowest-risk development route (Class MA permitted development). Liquidators prioritize speed and certainty over price, creating 20-30% discount potential. Freehold tenure eliminates leaseholder complications in PD conversions. Large buildings (10,000-100,000 sqft) deliver scale for luxury residential (15-150 flats). Price band targets Zone 1-2 commercial stock.

**Critique Integration:** Removed EPC filter (liquidation motivation sufficient); added planning constraints exclusion for clean PD path; freehold filter ensures title simplicity (Pattern 23A).

## **Strengths**
- **Maximum motivation:** Forced sale creates non-negotiable timeline pressure
- **Proven route:** Class MA is established PD path (lower planning risk)
- **Professional sellers:** Liquidators move quickly, no emotional negotiation
- **Clean titles:** Freehold filter reduces assembly risk
- **Scale advantage:** Large buildings suit Landmass's refurbishment expertise

## **Limitations**
- **Low volume:** Liquidation stock is rare (5-15 expected results)
- **As-is condition:** Deferred maintenance likely, requires thorough survey
- **Quick decisions:** Liquidators may run 30-90 day sale processes
- **Data gaps:** Liquidation properties may have incomplete marketing info

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run preset with filters in Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, City, Camden, K&C) and prime Zone 2 (Tower Hamlets, Southwark)
2. **Immediate triage:** Export all results, prioritize by location and vacancy status
3. **Liquidator contact:** Direct approach within 48 hours (speed advantage over competition)
4. **Desktop analysis:** Planning history check, structural desktop review (£5k-£10k)
5. **Offer strategy:** 15-25% below market value (factor in as-is risk + liquidator timeline pressure)
6. **Due diligence:** Structural survey, M&E assessment, title review (2-3 weeks)
7. **Prior approval:** Class MA application (56 days statutory timeline)
8. **Refurbishment:** Luxury fit-out (£150-£250/sqft for Zone 1, £100-£180/sqft Zone 2)
9. **Exit:** Sell at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1) or £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £10M-£60M (20-25% discount from market = £2.5M-£15M margin creation)
- **Refurbishment:** £2M-£8M (luxury fit-out for 20-100 units)
- **Fees & contingency:** £800k-£3M (legal, planning, surveys, finance)
- **Total:** £12.8M-£71M
- **Expected margin:** 25-35% gross (liquidation discount + refurb value-add)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Paste screenshot of what SearchLand AI actually created
3. Run validation script to check accuracy (compare intended vs actual)
4. Update prompts based on issues + update LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
5. Document results & property screenshots

Then continue to Stage 5 (Site Validation) and Stage 6 (Deep Research).
