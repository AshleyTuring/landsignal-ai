# **APPROACH G: Grey Belt Liquidation (High Risk/High Return)**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Previously Developed Green Belt + Forced Sale  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£23M (acquisition £3M-£15M + development £2M-£8M)  
**Expected Results:** 5-12 properties (Zone 2-3 fringe)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #7 "Grey Belt"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
3. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets previously developed Green Belt sites (25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding) with commercial uses eligible for residential conversion. Liquidation creates forced sale (20-30% discount). <1km train station essential for planning policy support (sustainable transport). 0.5-3 acres = manageable scale for £3M-£15M. Commercial-to-residential conversion aligns with housing policy priorities.

**Critique Integration:** Commercial use classes support conversion rationale; train distance critical for GB planning; liquidation = maximum motivation; excluded SSSI for planning confidence.

## **Strengths**
- **Lower competition:** Many avoid Green Belt entirely (opportunity)
- **Previously developed:** Planning exception established in case law
- **Maximum motivation:** Liquidation = 20-30% discount
- **Value uplift:** Commercial → residential + planning consent = 25-50% gain
- **Lower entry:** Zone 2-3 fringe = £3M-£15M acquisition

## **Limitations**
- **Planning difficulty:** Green Belt still challenging (local opposition)
- **Long timeline:** 18-24 months for planning (vs 56 days for PD)
- **Affordable housing:** S106 may require 20-35% affordable units
- **Higher risk:** Planning refusal risk exists despite precedent

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in outer Zone 2/Zone 3 LPAs (edge of Greater London)
2. **Precedent search:** Check planning history for similar approvals on site/nearby
3. **Liquidator contact:** Immediate approach (speed advantage)
4. **Pre-app consultation:** Planning consultant desktop + pre-app meeting (£10k-£20k)
5. **Offer strategy:** 20-30% below market (GB risk + liquidation)
6. **Full planning application:** Demonstrate housing need, brownfield priority, sustainable transport
7. **Timeline:** 18-24 months to consent
8. **Exit options:** Build-out OR sell with planning (25-50% uplift on planning alone)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £3M-£15M (20-30% discount)
- **Planning costs:** £200k-£500k (consultant, S106, legal)
- **Development (if build-out):** £2M-£8M
- **Total:** £5.2M-£23.5M
- **Expected margin:** 30-40% (distressed acquisition + planning/development uplift)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

**CONDITIONAL STATUS NOTES:**
- Test only if appetite for longer timeline (24-36 months)
- Requires planning expertise in Green Belt policy
- Best as opportunistic add-on (not core strategy)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Total Approaches Ready for Testing:** 7  
**Recommended Testing Priority:**

### Tier 1 (Highest Conviction - Test First):
1. **Approach A** - Class MA Liquidation (strongest motivation + proven route)
2. **Approach F** - Office Multi-Motivation (triple stack + immediate possession)

### Tier 2 (High Value - Test Second):
3. **Approach B** - Airspace Long Hold + Low EPC (capital-efficient + dual motivation)
4. **Approach E** - QSR/Retail Lease Expiry (good deal flow + dual PD paths)

### Tier 3 (Optionality - Test If Time Permits):
5. **Approach C** - Airspace Title Simplicity (lower capital entry)
6. **Approach D** - Airspace Lease + Liquidation (institutional scale)
7. **Approach G** - Grey Belt Liquidation (opportunistic, high return)

---

## DIVERSITY PRESERVED

The final 7 approaches span:
- **3 distinct strategic patterns:** PD conversion (A, F), airspace development (B, C, D), lease events (E), edge case (G)
- **Capital range:** £5M-£85M (from accessible to institutional scale)
- **Risk profiles:** Low (A, F), medium (B, E), medium-high (C, D), high (G)
- **Motivation signals:** Liquidation, vacancy, EPC, lease expiry, long hold
- **Execution timelines:** 12-18 months (PD routes) to 24-36 months (planning routes)

## TECHNICAL VALIDATION NOTES

All approaches use:
- ✅ Verified SearchLand presets (#32, #23, #17, #68, #7)
- ✅ Valid filter operators (is one of, is greater than, is before, contains any, does not contain)
- ✅ Realistic thresholds (price bands, size limits, date ranges)
- ✅ Geographic targeting (PTAL for Zone 1-2, LPA manual selection)

**No invalid filters identified** - all approaches are technically executable in SearchLand AI.
