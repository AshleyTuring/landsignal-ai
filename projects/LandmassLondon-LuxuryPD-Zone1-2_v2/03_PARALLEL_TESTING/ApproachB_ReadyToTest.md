# **APPROACH B: Airspace Long Hold + Low EPC (Regulatory Pressure)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Airspace Development + Tired Landlord Motivation  
**Capital Required:** £8M-£30M (acquisition £5M-£20M + airspace build £3M-£10M)  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
3. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
4. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
6. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
```

## **Rationale**
Targets low-rise commercial buildings (<15m = 3-5 storeys) with flat roofs in high-transport areas (PTAL 4-6b = Zone 1-2). Long hold (10+ years) signals tired ownership with trapped equity. Low EPC (D-G) creates regulatory pressure (MEES compliance) and improvement burden, making landlords receptive to airspace deals that release value without full sale. PTAL 4-6b provides planning policy support for height increases in accessible locations.

**Critique Integration:** Added floor area minimum for viable scale; PTAL filter ensures Zone 1-2 focus; excluded conservation/listed for clean planning path.

## **Strengths**
- **Capital efficiency:** Airspace rights cost 20-40% of full freehold value
- **Dual motivation:** Long hold (tired owner) + low EPC (regulatory pressure)
- **Policy support:** PTAL 4-6b areas have presumption for density/height
- **Lower competition:** Airspace negotiation requires sophistication, fewer buyers
- **High ROI:** Profit on new floors with low acquisition cost

## **Limitations**
- **Structural risk:** Not all buildings can support additional floors (desktop study required)
- **Complex negotiation:** Freeholder may be difficult or demand excessive airspace premium
- **Rights of light:** Neighboring properties may object
- **Construction staging:** Building occupied during works (logistics/access challenges)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run preset in Zone 1-2 LPAs with high PTAL scores
2. **Desktop screening:** Prioritize post-1970 concrete frames (better structural capacity)
3. **Owner approach:** "Your building needs £100k EPC upgrade; let's add value instead"
4. **Structural desktop:** Engineer assessment of load capacity (£10k-£20k)
5. **Option agreement:** Secure airspace rights (£100k-£500k option fee)
6. **Daylight/Sunlight:** ROOFL assessment for rights of light (£15k-£25k)
7. **Planning application:** 3-5 additional storeys (8-12 months)
8. **Construction:** Modern Methods (offsite manufacture, quick install)
9. **Exit:** Sell new flats at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1) or £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £500k-£5M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Structural works:** £180-£250/sqft shell & core for new floors (£1M-£5M)
- **Planning & technical:** £500k-£1.5M (structural, daylight, planning fees)
- **Construction:** £2M-£8M (3-5 floors at 2,000-5,000 sqft each)
- **Total:** £4M-£19.5M
- **Expected margin:** 20-30% (new floors at full GDV, low acquisition cost)
