### Approach A: Class MA Commercial Conversion Opportunities
**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"  
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Motivation + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (permitted development conversion)  
**Capital Required:** Acquisition £10M-£40M (Zone 2 focus), refurbishment £3M-£8M for luxury fit-out, total £13M-£48M  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (Zone 2 priority: Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 40000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000 AND is less than 40000
3. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
4. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset targets commercial buildings eligible for Class MA permitted development (E use classes, built-up areas, no major constraints). Refinements narrow to manageable scale (2,000-40,000 sqft for 6-60 flats), add strong motivation signals (poor EPC prevents rental, long corporate hold suggests divestment), and exclude planning blockers. In Zone 2, this creates 20-30% margins through PD speed and luxury refurbishment. Expected viable rate 60-70% after screening for actual PD eligibility and distress signals.

**Strengths:**
- Permitted development reduces planning risk and timeline (56 days vs 8-12 months)
- Poor EPC creates urgency (owners cannot rent until upgraded)
- Corporate ownership often indicates institutional divestment opportunities
- Scale fits luxury apartment development (20-60 units per building)

**Limitations:**
- Limited to E use classes (excludes B2/B8 offices unless mixed)
- Requires prior 2-year commercial use (check planning history)
- Zone 2 properties may have lower GDV than Zone 1 (£1,000-£2,000/sqft vs £2,000-£4,000)
- Competition from other PD seekers

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Run preset in SearchLand, apply Zone 2 LPA filters manually. Screen top 20 for PD eligibility (use class history, building age). Contact owners directly citing PD opportunity and EPC compliance costs. Target liquidation cases first (check Companies House). Aim for 3-5 acquisitions in first 6 months, focusing on buildings with flat roofs for potential airspace add-on.

### Approach B: Airspace Development on Commercial Buildings
**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"  
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Potential + Motivation  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (airspace intensification)  
**Capital Required:** Acquisition £15M-£60M (Zone 1-2 mix), airspace rights/build £5M-£15M, refurbishment £4M-£10M, total £24M-£85M  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1 priority: Westminster, Camden, City)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND is less than 60000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND is less than 50000
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
4. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
5. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
6. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset finds commercial buildings with flat roofs and no residential use, ideal for airspace development. Refinements target low-rise buildings (<15m) with room to add 3-5 storeys, add scale filters for viable projects, and include motivation signals (expiring leases create income cliff, liquidation forces quick sale). In Zone 1-2, this exploits height restrictions allowing additional floors while avoiding pure residential (leaseholder complications). Expected viable rate 50-60% after structural surveys confirm capacity.

**Strengths:**
- Existing utilities and access reduce development costs
- Flat roofs enable straightforward airspace additions (PD rights)
- Liquidation/administration creates distressed pricing (20-30% discount)
- Higher Zone 1 GDV supports premium pricing (£2,000-£4,000/sqft)

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural engineering assessment (additional £10k-£50k cost)
- Freeholder negotiation needed for airspace rights
- Zone 1 competition higher (more institutional buyers)
- Planning may still be required if exceeding height limits

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Execute preset, manually filter to Zone 1 LPAs. Prioritize buildings with expiring leases (contact landlords 6-12 months pre-expiry). Use liquidation signals for quick acquisitions. Conduct initial airspace viability studies on top 10. Target 2-4 developments in first year, leveraging Landmass's refurbishment expertise for luxury finishes.

### Approach C: Distressed Office Blocks with Low EPC
**Base Preset:** #67 "Offices with low EPC"  
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Motivation + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (office-to-residential conversion)  
**Capital Required:** Acquisition £8M-£35M (Zone 2 focus), conversion/refurb £3M-£7M, total £11M-£42M  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (Zone 2 priority: Hackney, Lambeth, Wandsworth)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #67 "Offices with low EPC"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 35000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000 AND is less than 30000
3. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
4. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3]
5. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
6. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset identifies office buildings with poor EPC ratings (D-G), indicating maintenance neglect and conversion motivation. Refinements add scale limits for manageable projects, corporate ownership for institutional distress signals, and long hold periods suggesting trapped equity. Excludes major constraints and focuses on simple freeholds. In Zone 2, offices often convert to residential via PD or planning, with luxury refurb creating 25-30% margins. Expected viable rate 55-65% after checking for viable conversion routes.

**Strengths:**
- Low EPC creates dual motivation (cannot rent + high energy costs)
- Corporate long holds often indicate portfolio rationalization
- Offices in Zone 2 often have good transport links (PTAL proxy)
- Simple freehold structures reduce legal complexity

**Limitations:**
- Offices may require full planning permission (not always PD-eligible)
- Zone 2 may have more Article 4 restrictions on conversions
- Competition from other office-to-resi converters
- Refurbishment costs higher for dated office fit-outs

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Apply preset with Zone 2 LPA filters. Screen for PD eligibility (Class MA if mixed use, or planning for pure offices). Target companies with >30 titles (portfolio divestment). Approach owners with EPC compliance costs as leverage. Secure 4-6 sites in first 6 months, focusing on buildings with potential for mixed-use (retail ground floor + residential above).
