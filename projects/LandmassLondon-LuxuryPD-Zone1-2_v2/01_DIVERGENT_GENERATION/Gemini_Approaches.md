### Approach A: The Liquidation Arbitrage

**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
**Refinements Applied:** Seller Motivation (Liquidation) + Financial (Price) + Scale (Size)
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Distressed Asset Acquisition)
**Capital Required:** £20M - £60M (Acquisition of entire asset at a significant discount)
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** [#32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"]

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
2. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND less than 60000000
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
4. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets the strongest possible seller motivation: forced sales by a liquidator or administrator. Such sellers are legally obligated to sell and prioritize speed and certainty over maximizing price, creating opportunities for discounts of 20-30%. By layering this motivation filter on top of the "Class MA eligible" preset, we directly source commercial-to-residential conversion opportunities from the most distressed sellers. The price and size filters align the search with Landmass's capital allocation for larger Zone 1 projects. The expected viable rate is very high, as the primary barrier (seller motivation) is pre-qualified.

**Strengths:**
- **Highest Motivation:** Directly targets legally forced sales, offering the greatest potential for below-market-value acquisitions and high profit margins.
- **Speed Certainty:** Liquidators are fast-moving, professional sellers, which aligns with Landmass's ability to transact quickly.
- **Reduced Competition:** The pool of developers with the capital and risk appetite for £10M+ liquidation deals is smaller.

**Limitations:**
- **Low Volume:** Properties in liquidation are rare, so this search will produce a low number of results.
- **Higher Risk:** Assets may have deferred maintenance, legal complications, or be in poor condition, requiring thorough due diligence.
- **As-Is Sales:** Properties are typically sold "as-is" with no warranties.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Run this search across Zone 1 and prime Zone 2 LPAs. Due to the rarity of these opportunities, it should be a standing search run weekly. When a property is identified, the due diligence process must be mobilized immediately, as administrators often run accelerated sales processes (30-90 days).

### Approach B: The Regulatory Airspace Play

**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"
**Refinements Applied:** Development Potential (Height) + Seller Motivation (Long Hold) + Financial (Off-Market)
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Capital-Efficient Intensification)
**Capital Required:** £2M - £10M (For airspace rights acquisition, not the full building)
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** [#23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"]

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 2
3. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy provides a capital-efficient entry into the high-value Zone 1 market by targeting only the airspace rights of existing buildings. The base preset identifies commercial buildings with flat roofs, a prerequisite for airspace development. The refinements add significant strategic value:
1.  `Max building height < 15m` targets low-to-mid-rise buildings (approx. <5 storeys) where adding 2-3+ floors is architecturally and politically more feasible.
2.  `Leaseholds < 2` ensures a simple ownership structure, making the negotiation for airspace rights with the freeholder far simpler than in a multi-let building.
3.  `Latest sold date < 2010` targets assets held for 15+ years, indicating potentially tired or passive owners who may be receptive to an offer that releases equity from their roof without selling the core asset.
4.  `Off-market` focus avoids competition and allows for a direct, creative negotiation with the owner.

**Strengths:**
- **Capital Efficiency:** Requires significantly less upfront capital than acquiring the entire freehold, lowering the barrier to entry for prime Zone 1 projects.
- **High ROI:** Profit is generated on the development of new units, while the acquisition cost is comparatively low.
- **Off-Market Advantage:** Directly approaching long-term owners creates unique opportunities that are not available on the open market.

**Limitations:**
- **Complex Negotiation:** Requires sophisticated negotiation with the existing freeholder to agree on the value and terms of the airspace rights.
- **Structural Risk:** Extensive due diligence is needed to confirm the existing structure can support additional floors.
- **Rights of Light:** Potential for disputes with neighbouring properties.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Execute this search across prime Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, K&C). Export the list of identified properties and their owners. Initiate a direct, off-market outreach campaign with a clear proposal to purchase the airspace rights, highlighting the benefits to the freeholder (capital release, minimal disruption).

### Approach C: The EPC Compliance Squeeze

**Base Preset:** #67 "Offices with low EPC"
**Refinements Applied:** Seller Motivation (Long Hold) + Financial (Price) + Scale (Size)
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Regulation-Driven Acquisition)
**Capital Required:** £5M - £20M (Acquisition of underperforming asset)
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** [#67 "Offices with low EPC"]

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 20000000
2. EPC rating: is one of [F, G]
3. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000
```

**Rationale:**
This approach exploits regulatory pressure. As of 2023, it is unlawful to let commercial properties with an EPC rating below E. This creates a class of distressed assets where owners must either spend significant capital on upgrades or sell. This strategy targets the most pressured owners by focusing on F and G rated buildings, which require the most expensive upgrades.

By combining the low EPC preset with a `Latest sold date > 10 years` filter, we target "tired landlords" who have held the asset long-term and are less likely to have the appetite for a costly, complex refurbishment. These owners are often highly motivated to sell to avoid a non-lettable, depreciating asset. The price and size filters focus the search on medium-sized opportunities suitable for Landmass's Zone 2 financial parameters and target of creating 20-60 luxury flats.

**Strengths:**
- **Clear Motivation:** The inability to legally let the property is a powerful, non-negotiable motivation for the seller to act.
- **Value-Add Opportunity:** Landmass's core expertise in luxury refurbishment directly solves the asset's problem (poor condition) and creates the profit margin.
- **Favorable Pricing:** The cost of required EPC upgrades can be factored into the purchase price negotiation, leading to a discount.

**Limitations:**
- **Refurbishment Complexity:** Buildings with G-ratings may have significant underlying issues beyond energy efficiency, requiring deep technical due diligence.
- **Competition:** Other value-add investors are also targeting these assets, though Landmass's focus on luxury provides a differentiated exit.
- **Vacancy Risk:** The property will likely be vacant, meaning no holding income during the planning and development phases.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Run this search across target Zone 2 LPAs (Islington, Hackney, Southwark, Tower Hamlets). Screen the results for properties with clear signs of under-investment. Approach owners or their agents with an offer that reflects the refurbishment cost and planning risk, presenting Landmass as an expert capable of taking on the complex project.
