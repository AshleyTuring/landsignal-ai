I'll generate multiple unique property search strategies for Landmass London based on the requirements and reference materials provided.

# Property Search Strategies for Landmass London

**Generated:** 2025-12-16  
**Client:** Landmass London (Luxury residential development)  
**Focus:** Zone 1-2 London, £5M-£60M, Permitted Development + distressed assets  
**Target Margin:** 20%+ (minimum 15%)

---

## Strategic Overview

Based on the requirements, I'm focusing on:
1. **Permitted Development routes** (Class MA, airspace) - reduces planning risk
2. **Strong seller motivation signals** (liquidation, EPC, lease expiry) - creates margin
3. **Zone 1-2 pricing** (£5M-£60M range)
4. **Distressed/unmodernized assets** - Landmass's refurb expertise = margin creation

---

## Approach A: Class MA Liquidation Plays (High Conviction)

**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (liquidation) + Scale (price range) + Geography (Zone 1-2)  
**Strategic Pattern:** Regulation-driven PD + Forced sale motivation  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£60M acquisition + £2M-£8M refurb  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
5. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 60000000
6. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
7. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND less than 100000
8. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#32):** E commercial → residential PD, built-up areas, avoids major constraints
- **Liquidation filter:** VERY strong motivation (forced sale, 20-30% discount potential)
- **Price range:** £5M-£60M = Zone 1-2 commercial buildings
- **Size:** 10,000-100,000 sqft (15-150 flats at conversion)
- **Freehold:** Simpler than leasehold for PD conversion
- **Expected viable rate:** 60-80% (liquidation = real motivation, MA = proven route)

**Strengths:**
- Maximum seller motivation (liquidator obligated to sell)
- PD route = faster than planning (12-18 months vs 24-36)
- Large buildings = scale for Landmass's expertise
- Price range matches budget exactly
- Precedent: Class MA is established route (SearchLand calculates profit)

**Limitations:**
- Small pool (liquidations rare but extremely high quality)
- May require quick decision (liquidator timeline)
- Some buildings may have tenant complications
- Structural surveys essential (deferred maintenance likely)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Export results, prioritize by location (Westminster, City, Camden first)
2. Immediate contact with liquidator/administrator (speed advantage)
3. Structural survey within 2 weeks
4. Offer 15-25% below market (liquidator motivated)
5. Prior approval application (56 days)
6. Refurb to luxury spec (Landmass strength)
7. Exit: £2,000-£4,000/sqft Zone 1, £1,000-£2,000/sqft Zone 2

## Approach B: Low-Rise Airspace + Long Hold Motivation

**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (long hold + low EPC) + Scale (Zone 1-2 pricing) + Potential (low-rise)  
**Strategic Pattern:** Airspace development + Tired landlord motivation  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£20M acquisition + £3M-£10M airspace build  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
7. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
8. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#23):** Flat roof commercial, no C3 (airspace opportunity)
- **<15m height:** 3-5 storeys currently = room for 3-5 additional floors (8-storey target)
- **Sold before 2015:** 10+ year hold = tired landlord, trapped equity
- **Low EPC (D-G):** Improvement pressure + motivation signal
- **PTAL 4-6b:** High transport = policy support for height + residential demand
- **NOT conservation/listed:** Clean planning path for airspace
- **Expected viable rate:** 40-60% (strong motivation + clear upside)

**Strengths:**
- Airspace = lower capital than full acquisition (negotiate air rights)
- PTAL 4-6b = planning policy supports tall buildings
- Long hold + low EPC = double motivation
- Flat roof = existing structure verified (preset filter)
- Zone 1-2 focus via PTAL filter

**Limitations:**
- Structural capacity unknown until survey (£10k-£20k)
- Freeholder negotiation required (may be difficult)
- Party wall agreements needed
- Construction staging complex (occupied building below)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify buildings with 10+ year holds
2. Approach freeholder: "Your building needs £100k EPC upgrade, let's add value instead"
3. Option agreement for air rights (£100k-£500k)
4. Structural engineer assessment
5. Planning application for 3-5 additional storeys
6. Construction: Modern Methods (offsite, quick install)
7. Sell new flats at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1) or £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

## Approach C: Expired Lease + High Footfall Retail Conversion

**Base Preset:** #46 "High footfall retail expiring leases"  
**Refinements Applied:** Geography (Zone 1-2) + Use class (conversion potential)  
**Strategic Pattern:** Income cliff motivation + High-value location  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£30M acquisition + £2M-£10M conversion  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (prime locations)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #46 "High footfall retail expiring leases"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
3. PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 6
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#46):** 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location), lease expiring (motivation)
- **PTAL 5-6b:** Zone 1-2 London (premium locations)
- **>6m height:** Multi-storey building (ground retail + upper floors conversion)
- **NOT conservation/listed:** Clean planning for change of use
- **Freehold:** Full control for conversion
- **Expected viable rate:** 50-70% (high footfall = valuable, but some will re-let)

**Strengths:**
- Prime locations (6,000+ footfall = Oxford Street, Bond Street, King's Cross level)
- Lease expiry = landlord motivated (void risk approaching)
- Ground floor retail value retained (can re-let or sell)
- Upper floors → luxury residential (Class MA or planning)
- Footfall data = quantified value (less speculation)

**Limitations:**
- Prime locations = competitive (other buyers interested)
- Some landlords will find new tenants (motivation gone)
- Retail values declining (high street challenges)
- May require planning if not MA-eligible

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for PTAL 5-6b (Zone 1-2)
2. Target leases expiring in 3-6 months (peak motivation)
3. Approach: "Avoid void, sell now, we close in 30 days"
4. Acquire at 10-20% discount (void risk premium)
5. Ground floor: Re-let to coffee/convenience (stable income)
6. Upper floors: Class MA conversion OR planning for residential
7. Sell flats at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (prime locations)

## Approach D: Office-to-Resi with Multiple Motivations (Stacking Signals)

**Base Preset:** #68 "Offices with no C3 and no lease"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (EPC + long hold) + Scale (Zone 1-2) + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Class MA + Multiple motivation signals  
**Capital Required:** £8M-£40M acquisition + £3M-£12M conversion  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #68 "Offices with no C3 and no lease"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
5. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
6. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
7. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
9. Company status: is one of [Active]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#68):** E(g)(i) offices, no C3 (MA eligible), lease ended/no leaseholds (vacant = strongest)
- **Low EPC (D-G):** Cannot rent until improved (£50k-£200k cost) = motivation
- **Sold before 2010:** 15+ year hold = trapped equity, tired ownership
- **PTAL 4-6b:** Zone 1-2, residential demand, policy support
- **NOT Flood Zone 3:** Major planning blocker eliminated
- **Active company:** Avoid dissolved (title complications)
- **Expected viable rate:** 60-80% (multiple motivations stacked)

**Strengths:**
- **Triple motivation:** Vacant (no income) + Low EPC (can't rent) + Long hold (tired)
- Class MA route = proven (no planning risk)
- 10-30m height = substantial buildings (scale)
- PTAL filter = Zone 1-2 focus
- Vacant = immediate possession (no tenant complications)

**Limitations:**
- Vacant = carrying costs for seller (but also for you during conversion)
- May have deferred maintenance (survey critical)
- Office market weak (but that's the opportunity)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Export results, prioritize vacant buildings (no lease = immediate)
2. Approach: "Your vacant office costs £X/month, needs £100k EPC, we solve both problems"
3. Offer 15-20% below market (stacked motivations)
4. Class MA prior approval (56 days)
5. Refurbishment to luxury residential (Landmass strength)
6. Exit: 50-100 flats at £1,500-£3,500/sqft depending on zone

## Approach E: Grey Belt Fringe Conversion (Lower Competition)

**Base Preset:** #7 "Grey Belt"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (liquidation) + Use class (commercial conversion) + Transport  
**Strategic Pattern:** Previously developed GB exception + Forced sale  
**Capital Required:** £3M-£15M acquisition + £2M-£8M development  
**Expected Results:** 5-12 properties (niche opportunity)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #7 "Grey Belt"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
7. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#7):** 25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed in GB)
- **Commercial use:** Conversion to residential (policy support for housing)
- **<1km train:** Zone 2-3 fringe, residential demand
- **Liquidation:** Maximum motivation (forced sale)
- **0.5-3 acres:** Manageable scale for £3M-£15M range
- **Expected viable rate:** 40-60% (GB still challenging, but precedent exists)

**Strengths:**
- **Lower competition:** Many avoid Green Belt entirely (opportunity)
- Previously developed = planning exception (established case law)
- Liquidation = 20-30% discount potential
- Commercial → residential = value uplift
- Fringe locations = lower acquisition, still in Greater London

**Limitations:**
- Green Belt planning still difficult (local opposition)
- Longer timelines (18-24 months for planning)
- May need affordable housing (Section 106)
- Transport <1km essential (without it, planning very hard)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Target properties with planning precedent (search "Proposal" for similar approvals)
2. Liquidator contact (immediate, before marketed)
3. Planning consultant pre-app (confirm previously developed status)
4. Offer at 20-30% discount (liquidation + GB risk)
5. Full planning application (demonstrate housing need, brownfield priority)
6. 18-24 months to consent
7. Build-out or sell with planning (25-50% value uplift on planning alone)
