# Pricing Strategy: Landmass London Project

**Client Profile**: £10-60M acquisition budget | Zone 1-2 luxury development opportunities

---

## Executive Recommendation

**Use Option 2: Retainer + Success Fee Model**

This hybrid structure balances risk protection with upside participation, while filtering out non-serious buyers.

### Core Rationale

- **Serious Capital**: £10-60M budget indicates genuine acquisition capability
- **Cost Coverage**: Retainer ensures you're not working for free during research phase
- **Aligned Incentives**: Success fee means you both win when deals close
- **Commitment Filter**: Retainer proves they're not tire-kickers

---

## Proposed Fee Structure

### Base Retainer
**£20,000/month for 3 months** (£60,000 total)
- Covers Phase 1 research and initial Phase 2 analysis
- Month-to-month commitment allows early exit if quality concerns arise

### Success Fee
**0.75% on closed acquisitions**
- Applied to deals closed within 12 months of delivery
- Capped at 3 deals to prevent indefinite free research usage

### ROI Example
If they close even one £15M deal from your pipeline:
- Success fee: £112,500
- Nearly 2x return on £60k retainer investment
- Positions your entire fee as "covered" by one win

---

## Conversation Positioning

### Opening Statement
> "I work on a retainer basis to cover research costs, plus a small success fee so we're aligned on finding you the best deals."

### Value Justification
> "The retainer is £20k/month for 3 months. If you close even one £15M deal from my pipeline, the success fee alone covers the entire retainer—and you'll likely have 50-100 opportunities to choose from."

### Handling Pushback
> "I can do pure success fee at 2%, but the retainer model ensures I prioritize your pipeline over other clients. With serious buyers, I prefer the aligned model."

---

## Pricing Anchors for Negotiation

### Value Framing

**Savings Perspective**:
> "If I find you one £15M deal that you acquire at 25% below market, you've saved £3.75M. My fee represents 1-2% of that savings."

**GDV Analysis**:
> "Phase 2 costs £50-80k, but one viable deal from that analysis is worth £10-20M in GDV. That's a 200-400x return on research investment."

**Industry Comparison**:
> "Most property sourcing firms charge 1-2% of purchase price as a finder's fee. I'm offering full pipeline development—50 to 100 opportunities—at a fraction of that cost."

### Risk Reduction Framing

**Phase-Gated Approach**:
> "Phase 1 is £25-40k. If the 50-100 opportunities aren't high-quality, you don't proceed to Phase 2. You're only committed to what adds value."

**Flexible Exit**:
> "The retainer is month-to-month. If you don't see value after month 1, we pause. I'm confident you will, but you're not locked in."

---

## What NOT to Do

| ❌ Avoid | Why It Hurts You |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Charge under £50k total** | Devalues the work, attracts tire-kickers who see research as cheap |
| **Give Phase 1 away free** | "Let me prove myself" signals desperation and low confidence |
| **Pure hourly billing** | Caps your upside, incentivizes slow work, misaligns with value created |

---

## Pricing Bottom Line

For a client deploying £10-60M, appropriate fee structures:

- **Fixed Fee**: £75k-£150k all-in (both phases)
- **Hybrid Model**: £60k retainer + 0.5-1% success fee

### Reality Check
The Weir Road example alone (£8-14M profit potential) justifies a £100k+ research fee. 

**If they can't see that ROI, they're not serious buyers.**

---

## Strategic Analysis & Considerations

### Strengths of This Approach

1. **Value-Based Pricing Philosophy**: Anchored to wealth creation, not hours spent
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Retainer filters commitment; success fee aligns outcomes
3. **The Math Works**: £100k is 0.17% of a £60M deployment—essentially noise

### Potential Optimizations

#### 1. Success Fee Timing
**Current**: 12 months from delivery  
**Consider**: 18-24 months

**Why**: Property transactions move slowly. Extending the window protects you from deals that take 15+ months to close.

#### 2. Deal Cap Structure
**Current**: 3 deals  
**Improved**: "3 deals OR £50M total acquisition value, whichever comes first"

**Why**: Prevents them cherry-picking 3 small deals (£5M each) while ignoring the £40M opportunity you identified.

#### 3. Retainer Duration
**Current**: 3 months (£60k)  
**Alternative Options**:
- £20k/month for 4-5 months (£80-100k total)
- £25k/month for 3 months with Phase 2 activation fee

**Why**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 likely requires 4-6 months of real work. Current structure may rush quality or leave you under-compensated.

### Alternative Structure to Consider

```
Phase 1: £35,000 fixed fee
  └─ Deliverable: 50-100 qualified opportunities

Phase 2: £15,000/month retainer + 0.75% success fee
  └─ Duration: 3-4 months
  └─ Cap: 3 deals OR £40M total value
  └─ Window: 18 months from delivery
```

**Benefits**:
- Separates "prove yourself" phase (fixed) from ongoing partnership (retainer + success)
- Higher total fee (£80-95k base + success) without sticker shock
- Clear value gates between phases

## Additional Conversation Tactics

### Scarcity Framing
> "I typically work with 2-3 clients at a time maximum because this level of research requires deep focus. The retainer ensures you're one of those priorities."

### Comparison to Alternatives
> "What's your alternative? Hiring an in-house researcher costs £60k salary + £20k benefits + 6 months training. Or you do it yourself, which has an opportunity cost of your time that's likely £200-500/hour."

> "Traditional agents bring you one deal at a time for 1-2% per deal. I'm building you a systematic pipeline of 50-100 opportunities for £75-100k total—potentially £1,500-3,000 per opportunity identified."

### Handling "That's Expensive"
> "Expensive compared to what? One month of wasted time pursuing the wrong deal opportunity costs you more than my entire fee. I'm de-risking your £10-60M deployment."

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away

If they exhibit any of these behaviors, they're not serious:

- ⚠️ Can't commit to £20k/month retainer but claim to have £10M+ to deploy
- ⚠️ Want "free trial" or "prove yourself first" for Phase 1
- ⚠️ Negotiate aggressively on price but not on deliverable scope
- ⚠️ Ask for research "samples" or "examples" without NDA/commitment
- ⚠️ Compare your fee to "my nephew who knows Excel"

**Remember**: Serious buyers understand serious research costs money. If they balk at £100-150k for work that generates £20-50M in value, that's a signal.

## Next Steps

1. **Review comparable project scope** (Brentwood, Weir Road) to validate deliverable alignment
2. **Script the pricing conversation** for initial call
3. **Prepare leave-behind pricing document** (1-page summary)
4. **Set calendar checkpoint**: Month 1 review to assess mutual fit
