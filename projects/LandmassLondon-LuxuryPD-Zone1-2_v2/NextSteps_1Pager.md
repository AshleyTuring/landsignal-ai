# Central London Development Opportunities
**For Landmass London | December 2025**

---

## The Problem

You're competing for the **same marketed deals as everyone else** - properties priced efficiently, multiple bidders, slim margins.

**The real opportunities?** They're in liquidation files, corporate non-core portfolios, and MEES-failed buildings **before they hit the market.**

---

## What We Found

**34,000+ properties** across Zone 1-2 matching your criteria  
**40 viable opportunity categories** (not just "offices for sale")  
**7 specific strategies** combining PD routes with forced-sale triggers

**Live Example:** Weir Road dual liquidation portfolio  
- 20,627 sq ft commercial in Balham  
- Both owners in liquidation (one liquidated 2 months ago)  
- £8-14M profit potential if executed correctly  
- Fresh opportunity - market hasn't found it yet

---

## What Happens Next

We systematically work through the 7 strategies to find your **hidden deal opportunities:**

**Phase 1: Deep-Dive Sourcing**  
→ Execute comprehensive searches across all 7 approaches  
→ Cross-reference with liquidation records, Companies House, planning history  
→ Filter for genuine motivation signals (not just "motivated seller" marketing speak)  
→ **Outcome:** Screen hundreds of potential properties to identify the truly viable ones

**Phase 2: Investment Analysis**  
→ Deep-dive on every qualified prospect (planning viability, title checks, ownership structures)  
→ Build financial models (acquisition, costs, GDV, profit per property)  
→ Identify deal-killers early (leasehold issues, planning constraints, hidden risks)  
→ Initial outreach to liquidators/owners (gauge price expectations, timeline)  
→ **Deliverable:** 5-15 investment-ready opportunities with full financial cases + offer strategies

**Phase 3: You Execute**  
→ You make offers armed with our research  
→ We support due diligence as needed  
→ You acquire at 20-30% below market because you found them first

**Reality Check:** Most strategies will yield 2-10 genuinely viable deals (like Weir Road). We're looking for **quality forced-sale situations**, not volume.

## Why This Works

**Timing:** Q1 2025 = liquidation spike + lease expiry cliff + MEES enforcement  
**Access:** You get opportunities **before they're marketed** = negotiation advantage  
**Thoroughness:** We analyze hundreds to deliver the handful worth your time  
**Your Edge:** £10-60M capital + refurbishment expertise = you can execute where others can't
