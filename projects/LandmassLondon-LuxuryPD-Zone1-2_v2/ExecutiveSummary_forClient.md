## 🔥 Featured Opportunity: Weir Road Dual Liquidation Portfolio

### Executive Summary

During initial research testing, we identified a **fresh liquidation opportunity** - a dual property portfolio in Balham (Zone 2) with significant development potential. Both properties entered liquidation recently, with the second property liquidating just **2 months ago (October 2025)**, suggesting early-mover advantage.

### Property Details

**Combined Portfolio:**
- **Location:** 8 & 10-12 Weir Road, Balham, London SW12 0NA
- **Total Developed Area:** 20,627 sq ft
- **Total Land:** 0.9 acres
- **Current Use:** Commercial/Industrial
- **Ownership:** Two companies in liquidation (same liquidation practitioners)

**Property 1: 10-12 Weir Road** (Title: SGL241433)
- Owner: CYMBA LTD (Company No. 12354433)
- **Status: Liquidation (October 28, 2025)** - FRESH!
- Developed Area: 6,474 sq ft
- Land: 0.45 acres

**Property 2: 8 Weir Road** (Title: SZ78987)
- Owner: CYPRBA LTD (Company No. 12534433)  
- Status: Liquidation (April 22, 2020)
- Developed Area: 14,153 sq ft
- Land: 0.45 acres

### Development Potential: Class MA Residential Conversion

**Gross Development Value (GDV) Scenarios:**

| Scenario | £/sq ft | Total GDV | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| Conservative | £1,000 | **£20.6M** | Industrial location, standard finish |
| Mid-Range | £1,200 | **£24.8M** | Good refurbishment, local comparables |
| Optimistic | £1,500 | **£30.9M** | Luxury finish, Zone 2 premium pricing |

### Financial Analysis (Mid-Range Scenario)

**Revenues:**
- GDV: **£24.8M**

**Costs:**
- Acquisition: £5-8M *(liquidation discount, forced sale)*
- Conversion: £4-5M *(£200-250/sq ft luxury refurbishment)*
- Lease/Tenant Issues: £1-2M *(potential lease buyout - see risk section)*
- Fees & Contingency: £1-1.5M *(legal, planning, finance)*
- **Total Investment: £11-16.5M**

**Returns:**
- **Gross Profit: £8-14M**
- **ROI: 50-100%**
- **Profit on GDV: 32-56%**

### Deal Dynamics

**Why This Is Interesting:**

1. **Dual Liquidation**: Both properties held by related companies (similar names, same incorporation date, same registered address) now both in liquidation with same practitioners at 7th Floor, 21 Lombard Street. High probability of **package sale**.

2. **Fresh Opportunity**: CYMBA's liquidation (October 2025) is only 2 months old. Market has not fully discovered this yet - early-mover advantage.

3. **Motivated Seller**: Liquidators have legal obligation to sell. Timeline pressure creates negotiation leverage for buyers.

4. **Permitted Development Route**: Class MA conversion (commercial → residential) = 56-day prior approval process vs. 8-12 month full planning.

5. **Scale**: 20,627 sq ft creates meaningful project (15-20 luxury apartments) at Zone 2 price point.

### ⚠️ Critical Risk: Leasehold Complexity

**Issue Discovered:**
Property 2 (8 Weir Road) has **two active commercial leaseholders**, including Travis Perkins with **14 years remaining** on lease. This creates a significant complication:

- **Class MA conversion requires vacant possession**
- Lease buyout required before development can proceed
- **Estimated buyout cost: £1-2M+** (Travis Perkins unlikely to leave cheaply)

**Impact on Economics:**
- Reduces net profit by £1-2M minimum
- Adds 6-12 months to timeline (lease negotiations)
- Increases transaction risk

**Potential Strategies:**
1. **Negotiate lease surrender** as part of liquidation process (liquidator may assist)
2. **Acquire at steep discount** (60-70% off) to compensate for buyout costs
3. **Property 1 only** (10-12 Weir Road) - standalone acquisition if cleaner title
4. **Alternative use** for Property 2 (continue commercial rental until lease natural expiry)

### Recommendation

**Phase 1: Due Diligence (2-3 weeks)**
- Confirm vacant possession status of Property 1
- Obtain Travis Perkins lease agreement (terms, break clauses, compensation clauses)
- Engage liquidation practitioners (express interest, understand sale timeline)
- Desktop planning review (Class MA eligibility, local authority precedents)
- Title search (any other encumbrances, rights of way, covenants)

**Phase 2: Conditional Offer (if due diligence positive)**
- Property 1 standalone: £4-5M
- Both properties (with lease buyout budget): £6-9M all-in
- Subject to satisfactory structural survey and lease resolution

**Decision Point:**
- If Property 1 has clean title + vacant possession → **strong opportunity**
- If lease buyout proves expensive/complex → **pass or reduce offer significantly**

## Seven Strategic Approaches Developed

Based on your investment criteria, we've developed **seven distinct sourcing strategies** that combine Permitted Development routes with motivated seller signals:

### Approach A: Class MA + Corporate Liquidation
- **Target:** Commercial buildings in forced sale (liquidations)
- **PD Route:** Class MA (commercial → residential conversion)
- **Motivation:** Liquidators legally obligated to sell (20-30% discount potential)
- **Expected Volume:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted, Zone 1-2)
- **Status:** ✅ Tested (Weir Road portfolio identified)

### Approach B: Airspace + Low EPC + Long Hold
- **Target:** Commercial buildings held 10+ years with poor energy ratings
- **PD Route:** Airspace development (add floors above existing buildings)
- **Motivation:** Regulatory pressure (MEES) + trapped equity in long holds
- **Expected Volume:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1-2)
- **Status:** Ready to test

### Approach C: Airspace + Unbroken Freeholds
- **Target:** Multi-unit flat buildings on single freehold title (no leasehold conflicts)
- **PD Route:** Airspace development
- **Motivation:** Title simplicity = faster transactions, less assembly risk
- **Expected Volume:** 10-30 properties (Zone 1-2)
- **Status:** Ready to test

### Approach D: Airspace + Dual Motivation (Liquidation + Lease Expiry)
- **Target:** Commercial buildings in liquidation with leases ending pre-2027
- **PD Route:** Airspace development
- **Motivation:** Double pressure (forced sale + income cliff approaching)
- **Expected Volume:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1 priority)
- **Status:** Ready to test

### Approach E: QSR/Retail + Dual PD Paths
- **Target:** Fast food restaurants and retail with expiring leases
- **PD Route:** Class MA or Class G (space above shops → 2 flats)
- **Motivation:** Lease expiry = income loss, operational pressure
- **Expected Volume:** 15-40 properties (Zone 2)
- **Status:** Ready to test

### Approach F: Office Buildings + Multi-Motivation Stack
- **Target:** Vacant offices with poor EPC, held long-term
- **PD Route:** Class MA conversion
- **Motivation:** Triple stack (vacancy cost + MEES non-compliance + long hold = exit pressure)
- **Expected Volume:** 8-20 properties (Zone 1-2)
- **Status:** Ready to test

### Approach G: Grey Belt + Liquidation (Higher Risk)
- **Target:** Green Belt sites with hardstanding/development history in liquidation
- **PD Route:** Various (case-by-case)
- **Motivation:** Liquidation sale of complex planning sites
- **Expected Volume:** 5-12 properties (Zone 2-3 fringe)
- **Status:** Conditional (higher planning risk)

**Diversification Strategy:**
These seven approaches provide optionality across:
- **Different PD routes** (Class MA vs Airspace vs Class G)
- **Different price points** (£5-20M vs £20-60M)
- **Different motivation triggers** (liquidation vs EPC vs lease expiry)
- **Different geographies** (Zone 1 vs Zone 2)

This ensures we don't rely on a single opportunity type and can pivot based on market conditions and your capacity.

## Market Timing & Competitive Advantage

**Why Now:**

1. **Regulatory Pressure Building:**
   - MEES (Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards) enforcement increasing
   - Poor EPC properties (E, F, G) cannot be rented
   - Many commercial landlords facing £50k-£500k+ upgrade costs → creating exit motivation

2. **Liquidation Activity Elevated:**
   - Post-COVID commercial casualties still working through system
   - Rising interest rates creating corporate distress
   - Weir Road portfolio example - CYMBA liquidated just 2 months ago

3. **Lease Expiry Cliff:**
   - Many commercial leases signed 2017-2020 (5-10 year terms) now expiring
   - Landlords facing income loss → motivated to sell vs face void periods

4. **Class MA Window:**
   - Permitted Development rights for commercial-to-residential established
   - Local authorities building track record (prior approval process becoming predictable)
   - Your refurbishment expertise maximizes value from these PD conversions

**Your Competitive Position:**
- **Capital availability** (£10-60M budget) allows you to move quickly vs. competitors
- **Refurbishment expertise** creates margin where others can't
- **Luxury positioning** means you can target higher end values (£2-4k/sq ft Zone 1)
- **Track record** de-risks projects for lenders and planning authorities

## Recommended Next Steps

To move from market analysis to active deal sourcing, we recommend a **phased approach**:

### Phase 1: Deep-Dive Testing (2-3 weeks)

**Objective:** Run comprehensive searches on the 7 developed approaches to build a qualified pipeline of 50-100 properties.

**Activities:**
1. Execute detailed property searches across all seven strategic approaches
2. Cross-reference results with company status, ownership, planning history
3. Screen for motivation signals (liquidation status, EPC ratings, lease expiries)
4. Build initial shortlist of 50-100 properties ranked by opportunity strength

**Deliverable:** Detailed opportunity register with property addresses, owners, motivation signals, estimated acquisition prices, and development potential

**Investment:** Research fees + data costs

---

### Phase 2: Desktop Due Diligence (3-4 weeks)

**Objective:** Narrow 50-100 properties down to top 10-15 with full desktop analysis.

**Activities:**
1. Planning history checks (precedents, constraints, PD eligibility confirmation)
2. Title searches (ownership verification, encumbrances, leases)
3. Companies House deep-dives (liquidation practitioners, timeline, related entities)
4. Desktop valuations (acquisition range, GDV scenarios, profit estimates)
5. Initial contact with liquidators/owners (gauge sale readiness, timeline, price expectations)

**Deliverable:** Detailed analysis pack on top 10-15 properties including:
- Full property details and ownership structure
- Planning assessment and PD route confirmation
- Financial model (acquisition, development costs, GDV, profit)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Recommended offer strategy

**Investment:** Professional fees (planning consultants, title searches, valuation advisors)

---

### Phase 3: Active Pursuit (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Make offers on top 3-5 opportunities and secure at least 1-2 acquisitions.

**Activities:**
1. Formal offers to liquidators/owners
2. Structural surveys and building condition assessments
3. Detailed planning applications (prior approval submissions)
4. Legal due diligence and contract negotiations
5. Financing arrangements
6. Exchange and completion

**Deliverable:** Signed acquisition agreements

**Investment:** Full transaction costs (legal, surveys, planning, financing, stamp duty)

---

## Investment Required: Research Phases

**Phase 1: Deep-Dive Testing**
- Estimated Cost: £15,000 - £25,000
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks
- Output: 50-100 qualified opportunities

**Phase 2: Desktop Due Diligence**
- Estimated Cost: £30,000 - £50,000 (including planning consultants, title searches)
- Timeline: 3-4 weeks
- Output: Top 10-15 opportunities with full financial models

**Total Research Investment:** £45,000 - £75,000 to reach offer-ready shortlist

**ROI on Research:**
- If 1 deal closes from shortlist: 0.3-0.5% of transaction value (on a £15M deal)
- If 2-3 deals close: Research cost becomes negligible vs. profit generated
- Eliminates wasted time on non-viable opportunities

---

## Why This Approach Works

**Data-Driven + Motivation-Focused:**
- Most property sourcing relies on relationships or marketed listings
- This approach systematically identifies **motivated sellers before they market**
- Liquidation, EPC pressure, lease expiries = quantifiable motivation signals

**Permitted Development = Risk Mitigation:**
- Full planning applications average 8-12 months with 30-40% refusal rates
- PD routes (Class MA, airspace, Class G) = 56 days with 90%+ approval rates
- Your capital is at risk for shorter periods

**Scale + Diversification:**
- 34,000+ properties across 40 categories provides deep pipeline
- 7 distinct approaches ensure you're not dependent on one opportunity type
- Can pivot based on market response and your capacity

**Value Creation Through Expertise:**
- Distressed/unmodernized assets create margin opportunity
- Your refurbishment expertise + luxury positioning maximizes exit values
- Most competitors avoid complexity - this approach targets it deliberately

---

## Conclusion

The central London market presents **significant opportunity** for your investment criteria, particularly when combining:

1. **Permitted Development eligibility** (Class MA, airspace, Class G)
2. **Motivated seller situations** (liquidations, regulatory pressure, lease expiries)
3. **Refurbishment value-add** (your competitive advantage)

We've identified **40 viable opportunity categories** spanning **34,000+ properties** in Zone 1-2 London. The **Weir Road dual liquidation portfolio** demonstrates the type of opportunities available when systematically searching for distressed commercial assets with PD potential.

**Recommendation:**
Proceed to **Phase 1: Deep-Dive Testing** to build a qualified pipeline of 50-100 properties across the seven strategic approaches. This creates optionality and ensures you have multiple shots on goal rather than chasing individual marketed opportunities.

The next 60-90 days represent an optimal window as:
- Q1 liquidation activity typically increases
- Commercial lease expiries create Q1 motivation spikes
- MEES enforcement continues to build pressure

We're ready to execute Phase 1 upon your instruction.
