## GROUPINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Group 1: Class MA + Liquidation Plays (A, B, C)
**Pattern:** Forced sale motivation + Permitted Development route  
**Similarity:** All three approaches target liquidation/administration companies with Class MA eligibility  
**Recommendation:** **Test Approach A (Claude)** - most comprehensive filter set, includes freehold filter for title simplicity

**Why consolidate:** All use preset #32, liquidation motivation, and price bands for Zone 1-2. Differences are minor (EPC variations, size thresholds). Testing all three would likely produce overlapping results.

---

### Group 2: Airspace Development (D, E, F)
**Pattern:** Capital-efficient intensification on low-rise commercial  
**Similarity:** All use preset #23 (flat roof commercial), target height mismatch opportunities  
**Recommendation:** **Test all three as variants:**
- **D (Claude):** Long hold + low EPC motivation (regulatory pressure)
- **E (Codex):** Title simplicity focus (unbroken freeholds)
- **F (Grok):** Lease expiry + liquidation (dual motivation)

**Why preserve diversity:** Each adds a distinct motivation layer that creates different seller psychology and negotiation leverage. D targets tired landlords, E targets structural simplicity, F targets time-pressure events.

---

### Group 3: Lease Expiry Plays (G, H)
**Pattern:** Income cliff motivation on commercial-to-residential conversion  
**Similarity:** Both target expiring leases to unlock conversion opportunities  
**Recommendation:** **Test Approach H (Codex)** - more specific use class targeting (E(b) QSR/retail) with dual PD paths (MA or ZA)

**Why consolidate:** G requires manual footfall verification (conditional status), H has cleaner filters and broader PD optionality.

---

### Group 4: Office Distress + Low EPC (I, J, K)
**Pattern:** Office-to-residential conversion with regulatory + economic pressure  
**Similarity:** All target low EPC offices with long holds or vacancy  
**Recommendation:** **Test Approach I (Claude)** - strongest motivation stack (vacant + low EPC + long hold)

**Why consolidate:** All three use similar logic (office conversion + regulatory pressure). I adds vacancy filter for immediate possession, creating fastest execution path.

---

### Group 5: Grey Belt Edge Case (L)
**Pattern:** Previously developed Green Belt exception + forced sale  
**Recommendation:** **Test as standalone** - unique strategy, lower competition, higher risk/return

**Why preserve:** Completely different from other approaches. Targets underexplored market segment with 30-40% margin potential. Worth testing despite longer timeline.

## PART 2: READY-TO-TEST APPROACHES

I'll now output each validated approach in the extraction-ready format.

# **APPROACH A: Class MA Liquidation Plays (Comprehensive)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Class MA PD + Forced Sale Motivation  
**Capital Required:** £12M-£68M (acquisition £10M-£60M + refurb £2M-£8M)  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 60000000
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND less than 100000
4. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

## **Rationale**
Combines the strongest possible seller motivation (liquidation = legally obligated to sell) with the lowest-risk development route (Class MA permitted development). Liquidators prioritize speed and certainty over price, creating 20-30% discount potential. Freehold tenure eliminates leaseholder complications in PD conversions. Large buildings (10,000-100,000 sqft) deliver scale for luxury residential (15-150 flats). Price band targets Zone 1-2 commercial stock.

**Critique Integration:** Removed EPC filter (liquidation motivation sufficient); added planning constraints exclusion for clean PD path; freehold filter ensures title simplicity (Pattern 23A).

## **Strengths**
- **Maximum motivation:** Forced sale creates non-negotiable timeline pressure
- **Proven route:** Class MA is established PD path (lower planning risk)
- **Professional sellers:** Liquidators move quickly, no emotional negotiation
- **Clean titles:** Freehold filter reduces assembly risk
- **Scale advantage:** Large buildings suit Landmass's refurbishment expertise

## **Limitations**
- **Low volume:** Liquidation stock is rare (5-15 expected results)
- **As-is condition:** Deferred maintenance likely, requires thorough survey
- **Quick decisions:** Liquidators may run 30-90 day sale processes
- **Data gaps:** Liquidation properties may have incomplete marketing info

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run preset with filters in Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, City, Camden, K&C) and prime Zone 2 (Tower Hamlets, Southwark)
2. **Immediate triage:** Export all results, prioritize by location and vacancy status
3. **Liquidator contact:** Direct approach within 48 hours (speed advantage over competition)
4. **Desktop analysis:** Planning history check, structural desktop review (£5k-£10k)
5. **Offer strategy:** 15-25% below market value (factor in as-is risk + liquidator timeline pressure)
6. **Due diligence:** Structural survey, M&E assessment, title review (2-3 weeks)
7. **Prior approval:** Class MA application (56 days statutory timeline)
8. **Refurbishment:** Luxury fit-out (£150-£250/sqft for Zone 1, £100-£180/sqft Zone 2)
9. **Exit:** Sell at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1) or £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £10M-£60M (20-25% discount from market = £2.5M-£15M margin creation)
- **Refurbishment:** £2M-£8M (luxury fit-out for 20-100 units)
- **Fees & contingency:** £800k-£3M (legal, planning, surveys, finance)
- **Total:** £12.8M-£71M
- **Expected margin:** 25-35% gross (liquidation discount + refurb value-add)

# **APPROACH B: Airspace Long Hold + Low EPC (Regulatory Pressure)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Airspace Development + Tired Landlord Motivation  
**Capital Required:** £8M-£30M (acquisition £5M-£20M + airspace build £3M-£10M)  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
3. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
4. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
6. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
```

## **Rationale**
Targets low-rise commercial buildings (<15m = 3-5 storeys) with flat roofs in high-transport areas (PTAL 4-6b = Zone 1-2). Long hold (10+ years) signals tired ownership with trapped equity. Low EPC (D-G) creates regulatory pressure (MEES compliance) and improvement burden, making landlords receptive to airspace deals that release value without full sale. PTAL 4-6b provides planning policy support for height increases in accessible locations.

**Critique Integration:** Added floor area minimum for viable scale; PTAL filter ensures Zone 1-2 focus; excluded conservation/listed for clean planning path.

## **Strengths**
- **Capital efficiency:** Airspace rights cost 20-40% of full freehold value
- **Dual motivation:** Long hold (tired owner) + low EPC (regulatory pressure)
- **Policy support:** PTAL 4-6b areas have presumption for density/height
- **Lower competition:** Airspace negotiation requires sophistication, fewer buyers
- **High ROI:** Profit on new floors with low acquisition cost

## **Limitations**
- **Structural risk:** Not all buildings can support additional floors (desktop study required)
- **Complex negotiation:** Freeholder may be difficult or demand excessive airspace premium
- **Rights of light:** Neighboring properties may object
- **Construction staging:** Building occupied during works (logistics/access challenges)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run preset in Zone 1-2 LPAs with high PTAL scores
2. **Desktop screening:** Prioritize post-1970 concrete frames (better structural capacity)
3. **Owner approach:** "Your building needs £100k EPC upgrade; let's add value instead"
4. **Structural desktop:** Engineer assessment of load capacity (£10k-£20k)
5. **Option agreement:** Secure airspace rights (£100k-£500k option fee)
6. **Daylight/Sunlight:** ROOFL assessment for rights of light (£15k-£25k)
7. **Planning application:** 3-5 additional storeys (8-12 months)
8. **Construction:** Modern Methods (offsite manufacture, quick install)
9. **Exit:** Sell new flats at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1) or £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £500k-£5M (negotiated with freeholder)
- **Structural works:** £180-£250/sqft shell & core for new floors (£1M-£5M)
- **Planning & technical:** £500k-£1.5M (structural, daylight, planning fees)
- **Construction:** £2M-£8M (3-5 floors at 2,000-5,000 sqft each)
- **Total:** £4M-£19.5M
- **Expected margin:** 20-30% (new floors at full GDV, low acquisition cost)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Paste screenshot of what SearchLand AI actually created
3. Run validation script to check accuracy
4. Update prompts based on issues + update LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
5. Document results & property screenshots

# **APPROACH C: Airspace Title Simplicity (Unbroken Freeholds)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Airspace Development + Title Simplicity  
**Capital Required:** £5.5M-£16M (airspace £5M-£15M + fees £500k-£1M)  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Max building height (m): is less than 12
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Sales listing price: is between 5000000 and 20000000
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

## **Rationale**
Focuses on structural simplicity to reduce airspace negotiation risk. "Number of leaseholds < 1" (unbroken freehold) means a single owner controls the entire building, eliminating rooftop rights negotiation with multiple leaseholders. Lower height threshold (<12m = 3-4 storeys) targets older, under-built stock where adding 1-3 floors is most feasible. Smaller ticket (<£20M) provides more deal flow in Zone 2 and edge Zone 1.

**Critique Integration:** Pattern 23A (title simplicity) applied; added planning constraints exclusion; price band targets accessible entry points.

## **Strengths**
- **Simple negotiation:** Single freeholder (no leaseholder complications)
- **Lower capital:** £5M-£20M entry point (more deal opportunities)
- **Clear ownership:** Unbroken title reduces legal complexity
- **Quick execution:** Simpler structure accelerates timeline
- **Post-1970 frames:** Lower buildings often concrete (good structural capacity)

## **Limitations**
- **Lower GDV:** Zone 2 focus means £1,000-£2,000/sqft (vs £2,000-£4,000 Zone 1)
- **Structural capacity:** Still requires desktop study (not all frames suitable)
- **Rights of light:** Risk remains (neighboring properties)
- **Lender appetite:** Some lenders cautious on airspace deals

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run preset in Zone 2 LPAs (Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Hackney, Islington)
2. **Title verification:** Check Land Registry for unbroken freeholds (single owner)
3. **Owner approach:** Direct outreach with airspace proposal
4. **Structural desktop:** Desktop study on top 10 (prioritize post-1970)
5. **Option agreement:** Secure airspace rights (£100k-£300k)
6. **Planning application:** 1-3 additional storeys
7. **Construction:** Offsite manufacture + quick install
8. **Exit:** £1,000-£2,000/sqft for new floors (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Airspace rights:** £300k-£2M (negotiated with single freeholder)
- **Structural works:** £180-£250/sqft shell & core (£800k-£3M for 1-3 floors)
- **Planning & technical:** £300k-£800k (structural, daylight, fees)
- **Construction:** £1.5M-£6M (1-3 floors at 1,500-4,000 sqft each)
- **Total:** £2.9M-£11.8M
- **Expected margin:** 20-30% (blended across new floors)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH D: Airspace Lease Expiry + Liquidation (Dual Motivation)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Airspace Development + Time-Pressure Events  
**Capital Required:** £24M-£85M (acquisition £15M-£60M + build £5M-£15M + refurb £4M-£10M)  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1 priority)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND is less than 60000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND is less than 50000
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
4. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
5. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
6. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
```

## **Rationale**
Stacks two time-pressure motivations: expiring leases (income cliff within 2 years) and liquidation (forced sale). Larger buildings (10,000-50,000 sqft) in Zone 1 price band create institutional-scale opportunities with airspace upside. Low-rise (<15m) with high un-constrained percentage ensures clean airspace development path. Liquidation + lease expiry creates urgent exit need, supporting 20-30% acquisition discount.

**Critique Integration:** Added un-constrained percentage for planning confidence; dual motivation creates compounding seller pressure.

## **Strengths**
- **Dual motivation:** Lease expiry (income loss) + liquidation (forced sale)
- **Institutional scale:** £10M-£60M targets larger opportunities
- **Zone 1 GDV:** £2,000-£4,000/sqft on new airspace floors
- **Planning confidence:** >70% un-constrained + low-rise = approval likelihood
- **Distressed pricing:** 20-30% discount potential from dual pressure

## **Limitations**
- **Higher capital:** £24M-£85M total requires significant equity/debt
- **Zone 1 competition:** More institutional buyers active
- **Structural risk:** Large buildings may have complex load paths
- **Quick decisions:** Liquidation + lease expiry = compressed timeline

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, Camden, City, K&C)
2. **Liquidator contact:** Immediate approach (6-12 months pre-lease expiry = peak pressure)
3. **Desktop analysis:** Structural capacity + lease review
4. **Offer strategy:** 20-25% below market (factor in dual motivations)
5. **Structural survey:** Detailed assessment (£20k-£50k)
6. **Airspace planning:** 3-5 additional storeys
7. **Refurbishment:** Luxury fit-out for base building + new floors
8. **Exit:** Blended £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £15M-£60M (20-25% discount)
- **Airspace construction:** £5M-£15M (3-5 floors)
- **Refurbishment:** £4M-£10M (luxury fit-out)
- **Fees & contingency:** £2M-£5M
- **Total:** £26M-£90M
- **Expected margin:** 20-30% (distressed acquisition + airspace value-add)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH E: QSR/Retail Lease Expiry (Dual PD Paths)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Lease Expiry + Change of Use Conversion  
**Capital Required:** £7.6M-£19M (acquisition £7M-£18M + conversion £600k-£1M)  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (Zone 2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #17 "Commercial with expiring leases"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Use class: is one of [E(b), E]
2. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000
4. Sales listing price: is between 5000000 and 20000000
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets QSR/retail/office hybrids (E(b)/E use classes) with imminent lease expiry (within 2 years = income cliff). Expiring branded covenants create landlord motivation (void risk + re-letting costs). Larger units (>5,000 sqft) support 20-40 residential units via Class MA conversion or Class ZA demolish/rebuild. Dual PD paths increase optionality. Zone 2 price band (£5M-£20M) provides deal flow.

**Critique Integration:** E(b) targets branded QSR units; dual PD paths (MA or ZA) provide fallback; excluded conservation for clean planning.

## **Strengths**
- **Time-based motivation:** Lease expiry = approaching income cliff
- **Branded units:** Often over-rented (market rent rebase opportunity)
- **Dual PD routes:** Class MA (conversion) or Class ZA (rebuild) = flexibility
- **Good locations:** Retail units typically high-street/transport hubs
- **No distress stigma:** Lease expiry is business-as-usual event

## **Limitations**
- **Renewal rights:** Some leases may have tenant options (check lease terms)
- **Contamination:** Former kitchens require environmental assessment
- **Signage/rights:** Must clear third-party rights and advertising
- **Competition:** Lease expiry is public info (other buyers aware)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in Zone 2 LPAs (Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Hackney)
2. **Lease analysis:** Export results, prioritize leases expiring in 3-12 months
3. **Landlord approach:** "Avoid void + re-letting costs, we exchange now"
4. **Dual appraisal:** Model both MA conversion and ZA rebuild (choose best margin)
5. **Offer strategy:** 10-15% below market (factor in void risk premium)
6. **Environmental survey:** Former kitchen areas (£5k-£10k)
7. **Prior approval:** Class MA or ZA (56 days)
8. **Conversion/rebuild:** £140-£210/sqft for residential fit-out
9. **Exit:** £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £7M-£18M (10-15% discount)
- **Conversion/rebuild:** £600k-£1M (strip/refit or shell)
- **Fees & contingency:** £400k-£800k
- **Total:** £8M-£19.8M
- **Expected margin:** 18-28% (lease-event discount + change-of-use uplift)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH F: Office Multi-Motivation Stack (Vacant + Low EPC + Long Hold)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Office-to-Residential + Triple Motivation  
**Capital Required:** £11M-£52M (acquisition £8M-£40M + conversion £3M-£12M)  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties (Zone 1-2)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #68 "Offices with no C3 and no lease"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
2. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
3. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
4. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
5. Company status: is one of [Active]
6. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
```

## **Rationale**
Stacks three motivations for maximum seller pressure: (1) vacant office (no income + carrying costs), (2) low EPC (cannot rent until upgraded = £50k-£200k cost), (3) long hold >15 years (trapped equity + tired ownership). PTAL 4-6b ensures Zone 1-2 locations with policy support for residential conversion. Vacant offices are Class MA eligible (E(g)(i) use class) with no tenant complications.

**Critique Integration:** Triple motivation creates compounding pressure; PTAL filter ensures Zone 1-2; active company status avoids dissolved entity complications.

## **Strengths**
- **Triple motivation:** Vacant (no income) + low EPC (can't rent) + long hold (tired)
- **Immediate possession:** Vacant = no tenant negotiations or wait periods
- **Proven PD route:** Class MA for offices is established path
- **Scale buildings:** 10,000+ sqft = 20-100 luxury units
- **Policy support:** PTAL 4-6b areas favor residential conversion

## **Limitations**
- **Carrying costs:** Vacant for you during conversion too (finance burden)
- **Deferred maintenance:** Vacant often indicates neglect (survey critical)
- **Weak office market:** Helps acquisition, but limits alternative exits
- **MEP costs:** Low EPC may indicate major systems replacement needed

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in Zone 1-2 LPAs with PTAL 4-6b
2. **Motivation screening:** Prioritize true vacancy (not temporarily empty)
3. **Owner approach:** "Your vacant office costs £X/month + needs £100k EPC upgrade"
4. **Offer strategy:** 15-20% below market (stack all three motivations)
5. **Survey:** Structural + M&E assessment (£15k-£30k)
6. **Class MA prior approval:** 56 days statutory timeline
7. **Refurbishment:** Luxury residential fit-out (£150-£250/sqft Zone 1, £100-£180/sqft Zone 2)
8. **Exit:** 20-100 flats at £1,500-£3,500/sqft depending on zone

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £8M-£40M (15-20% discount = £1.4M-£8M margin creation)
- **Conversion:** £3M-£12M (luxury fit-out for 20-100 units)
- **Fees & contingency:** £1M-£4M
- **Total:** £12M-£56M
- **Expected margin:** 22-32% (stacked motivations + refurb value-add)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH G: Grey Belt Liquidation (High Risk/High Return)**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Previously Developed Green Belt + Forced Sale  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£23M (acquisition £3M-£15M + development £2M-£8M)  
**Expected Results:** 5-12 properties (Zone 2-3 fringe)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

**START WITH PRESET:** #7 "Grey Belt"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
3. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

## **Rationale**
Targets previously developed Green Belt sites (25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding) with commercial uses eligible for residential conversion. Liquidation creates forced sale (20-30% discount). <1km train station essential for planning policy support (sustainable transport). 0.5-3 acres = manageable scale for £3M-£15M. Commercial-to-residential conversion aligns with housing policy priorities.

**Critique Integration:** Commercial use classes support conversion rationale; train distance critical for GB planning; liquidation = maximum motivation; excluded SSSI for planning confidence.

## **Strengths**
- **Lower competition:** Many avoid Green Belt entirely (opportunity)
- **Previously developed:** Planning exception established in case law
- **Maximum motivation:** Liquidation = 20-30% discount
- **Value uplift:** Commercial → residential + planning consent = 25-50% gain
- **Lower entry:** Zone 2-3 fringe = £3M-£15M acquisition

## **Limitations**
- **Planning difficulty:** Green Belt still challenging (local opposition)
- **Long timeline:** 18-24 months for planning (vs 56 days for PD)
- **Affordable housing:** S106 may require 20-35% affordable units
- **Higher risk:** Planning refusal risk exists despite precedent

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Search execution:** Run in outer Zone 2/Zone 3 LPAs (edge of Greater London)
2. **Precedent search:** Check planning history for similar approvals on site/nearby
3. **Liquidator contact:** Immediate approach (speed advantage)
4. **Pre-app consultation:** Planning consultant desktop + pre-app meeting (£10k-£20k)
5. **Offer strategy:** 20-30% below market (GB risk + liquidation)
6. **Full planning application:** Demonstrate housing need, brownfield priority, sustainable transport
7. **Timeline:** 18-24 months to consent
8. **Exit options:** Build-out OR sell with planning (25-50% uplift on planning alone)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- **Acquisition:** £3M-£15M (20-30% discount)
- **Planning costs:** £200k-£500k (consultant, S106, legal)
- **Development (if build-out):** £2M-£8M
- **Total:** £5.2M-£23.5M
- **Expected margin:** 30-40% (distressed acquisition + planning/development uplift)

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

**CONDITIONAL STATUS NOTES:**
- Test only if appetite for longer timeline (24-36 months)
- Requires planning expertise in Green Belt policy
- Best as opportunistic add-on (not core strategy)

### Tier 1 (Highest Conviction - Test First):
1. **Approach A** - Class MA Liquidation (strongest motivation + proven route)
2. **Approach F** - Office Multi-Motivation (triple stack + immediate possession)

### Tier 2 (High Value - Test Second):
3. **Approach B** - Airspace Long Hold + Low EPC (capital-efficient + dual motivation)
4. **Approach E** - QSR/Retail Lease Expiry (good deal flow + dual PD paths)

### Tier 3 (Optionality - Test If Time Permits):
5. **Approach C** - Airspace Title Simplicity (lower capital entry)
6. **Approach D** - Airspace Lease + Liquidation (institutional scale)
7. **Approach G** - Grey Belt Liquidation (opportunistic, high return)

## DIVERSITY PRESERVED

The final 7 approaches span:
- **3 distinct strategic patterns:** PD conversion (A, F), airspace development (B, C, D), lease events (E), edge case (G)
- **Capital range:** £5M-£85M (from accessible to institutional scale)
- **Risk profiles:** Low (A, F), medium (B, E), medium-high (C, D), high (G)
- **Motivation signals:** Liquidation, vacancy, EPC, lease expiry, long hold
- **Execution timelines:** 12-18 months (PD routes) to 24-36 months (planning routes)

## TECHNICAL VALIDATION NOTES

All approaches use:
- ✅ Verified SearchLand presets (#32, #23, #17, #68, #7)
- ✅ Valid filter operators (is one of, is greater than, is before, contains any, does not contain)
- ✅ Realistic thresholds (price bands, size limits, date ranges)
- ✅ Geographic targeting (PTAL for Zone 1-2, LPA manual selection)

**No invalid filters identified** - all approaches are technically executable in SearchLand AI.
