# Disagreement Detection Task

Analyze the 4 critique files and identify TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS CASE DISAGREEMENTS.

## What Counts as Disagreement
- LLM A says filter exists, LLM B says it doesn't (factual dispute)
- LLM A says "acres", LLM B says "sqft" for same filter (unit dispute)
- LLM A says VALID syntax, LLM B says INVALID syntax (technical dispute)
- LLM A says £n is sufficient, LLM B says it's not (capital feasibility dispute)
- LLM A says ROI achievable, LLM B says unrealistic (business case dispute)
- LLM A says deal structure works, LLM B says legally/financially flawed (implementation dispute)

## What Does NOT Count
- Priority rankings (A ranks #1, B ranks #3 - both valid)
- Strategic preferences (speed vs certainty - philosophical)
- Implementation styles (different but both correct)

## Special Note on Precedent-Based Approaches
For approaches replicating user-provided planning applications:
- Business case is AUTO-VALID (user requested it)
- Focus validation on: Do filters actually replicate the precedent correctly?
- Multiple valid filter implementations are expected and acceptable

## Output Format
If disagreements exist:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** [Filter existence | Units | Syntax | Capital feasibility | ROI | Deal structure]
**Approaches:** [Which approaches affected]
**Positions:**
- LLM A: [Position]
- LLM B: [Position]
- LLM C: [Position]
- LLM D: [Position]

**Impact:** [Critical | Minor]
**Requires iteration:** [YES | NO]

# Technical & Business Case Validation Report

## Executive Summary

I've completed a comprehensive technical validation of **all 14 approaches** (5 Claude, 3 Codex, 3 Gemini, 3 Grok) across the key validity dimensions: filter existence, syntax correctness, unit accuracy, capital feasibility, and business case viability.

**Key Findings:**
- **12/14 approaches are VALID** with correct filters, syntax, and business logic
- **2/14 approaches are CONDITIONAL** requiring minor filter corrections
- **0/14 approaches are INVALID** - all can be executed with minor or no changes
- **Strategic diversity is excellent** - approaches span 6+ strategic categories with minimal overlap

## VALIDATION RESULTS

### Claude - Approach A: Class MA Liquidation Plays
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #32, Sales listing price, Company status, Property floor area, Tenure
- ✅ Syntax correct: List-based operators properly used (`is one of`)
- ✅ Units correct: sqft (10,000-100,000), price (£5M-£60M)
- ✅ Capital feasible: £10M-£60M acquisition matches Zone 1-2 budget

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: 20-30% discount (liquidation) + Class MA refurb = 25-35% margin achievable
- ✅ Implementation viable: Liquidation = forced sale (strong motivation), MA = proven PD route
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Freehold acquisition, no complex negotiations

**Strategic Notes:**
- Extremely high-conviction approach (liquidation + PD route stacking)
- Low volume but very high quality (each opportunity is strong)
- Expected 60-80% viable rate is realistic given motivation strength

---

### Claude - Approach B: Low-Rise Airspace + Long Hold Motivation
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #23, Max building height (m), Latest sold date, EPC rating, PTAL, Planning constraints
- ✅ Syntax correct: Height in metres (<15m), date format (before 2015-01-01), list operators
- ✅ Units correct: metres for height, PTAL levels correct
- ✅ Capital feasible: £5M-£20M acquisition + £3M-£10M airspace build = manageable for budget

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Airspace = lower acquisition cost, sell new flats at £1,000-£4,000/sqft = 20-30% margin realistic
- ✅ Implementation viable: PTAL 4-6b = policy support for height, long hold + low EPC = double motivation
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Option agreement for air rights is standard practice

**Strategic Notes:**
- Capital-efficient entry (airspace rights vs full freehold)
- 40-60% viable rate is appropriate (structural capacity unknown until survey)
- PTAL filter = strong planning policy support

---

### Claude - Approach C: Expired Lease + High Footfall Retail Conversion
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #46, PTAL, Max building height (m), Planning constraints, Tenure
- ✅ Syntax correct: PTAL values (5, 6a, 6b), height operator (is greater than 6), constraints exclusion
- ✅ Units correct: metres for height
- ✅ Capital feasible: £5M-£30M acquisition + £2M-£10M conversion

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Prime locations (6,000+ footfall) + lease expiry discount (10-20%) + conversion uplift = 18-28% margin achievable
- ✅ Implementation viable: Lease expiry = income cliff motivation, Class MA or planning route available
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Freehold acquisition, ground floor retail retained (income)

**Strategic Notes:**
- High footfall (6,000+) = quantified location value (less speculation)
- 50-70% viable rate realistic (some will re-let, but base preset pre-filters for expiry)
- Prime locations = competitive, but motivation creates edge

---

### Claude - Approach D: Office-to-Resi with Multiple Motivations (Stacking Signals)
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #68, EPC rating, Latest sold date, PTAL, Planning constraints, Company status
- ✅ Syntax correct: EPC list (E, F, G, D), date (before 2010-01-01), PTAL levels, constraint exclusion
- ✅ Units correct: All filters use correct units
- ✅ Capital feasible: £8M-£40M acquisition + £3M-£12M conversion

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: **Triple motivation stack** (vacant + low EPC + long hold) = 15-20% discount, Class MA conversion = 22-32% margin realistic
- ✅ Implementation viable: Base preset ensures MA-eligible (E(g)(i) offices, no C3, no lease)
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Active company filter avoids dissolved entities (title complications)

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Excellent motivation stacking**: Vacant (no income) + Cannot rent (low EPC) + Tired owner (15+ years)
- 60-80% viable rate is high but justified by triple motivation pre-filtering
- Strongest approach for scale (50-100 flats per building)

---

### Claude - Approach E: Grey Belt Fringe Conversion (Lower Competition)
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ Most filters exist: Preset #7, Use class, Distance to nearest Train Station, Company status, Title area
- ⚠️ **ISSUE:** `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3` - Correct syntax, but check if SearchLand AI parses compound AND correctly in this context
- ✅ Syntax correct: Use class list operator (`contains any`), distance in metres, company status
- ✅ Units correct: acres for area, metres for distance

**Suggested Fix:**
If SearchLand AI fails to parse compound AND, split into two lines:
```
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5
11. Title area (acres): is less than 3
```

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Liquidation discount (20-30%) + commercial → residential uplift = 30-40% margin achievable
- ⚠️ Implementation risk: Green Belt planning is challenging (18-24 months), but "previously developed" exception is valid
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Liquidation = forced sale, <1km train essential for planning

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Niche opportunity**: Many avoid Green Belt entirely (less competition)
- 40-60% viable rate realistic (Grey Belt = previously developed, but still challenging)
- High margin potential (30-40%) justified by planning risk and discount stacking

---

### Codex - Approach A: Class MA – Liquidation, Low EPC, Unbroken Freeholds
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #32, Property floor area (sqft), Sales listing price, EPC rating, Company status, Number of leaseholds
- ✅ Syntax correct: `is between` (numeric), `is one of` (list), `is less than` (numeric)
- ✅ Units correct: sqft (>2,000), price (£10M-£60M)
- ✅ Capital feasible: £15M-£35M acquisition + £150-£220/sqft refurb

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Liquidation (20-25% discount) + EPC E-G (improvement margin) + unbroken freehold (fast execution) = 20-25% gross margin achievable
- ✅ Implementation viable: PD route + clean title + distress = all three reduce risk
- ✅ Deal structure sound: No leasehold complications (Pattern 23A)

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Triple efficiency stack**: PD (faster) + Liquidation (discount) + Unbroken title (no assembly)
- Very similar to Claude Approach A but adds EPC E-G filter (additional motivation layer)
- Expected 8-20 properties realistic for Zone 1 with these filters

---

### Codex - Approach B: Airspace – Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones, Unbroken Freeholds
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #23, Max building height (m), Property floor area (sqft), Number of leaseholds, Sales listing price
- ✅ Syntax correct: Height <12m, sqft >2,000, leaseholds <1, price range
- ✅ Units correct: metres, sqft, price
- ✅ Capital feasible: £5M-£15M airspace acquisition + £180-£250/sqft shell & core

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Lower capital entry + airspace floors at £1k-£2k/sqft (Zone 2) = 20%+ blended margin achievable
- ✅ Implementation viable: Unbroken freehold removes negotiation complexity (Pattern 23A + Pattern 5A)
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Post-1970 frames (structural capacity likely) + flat roofs (confirmed by preset)

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Pattern 5A application**: Low-rise (<12m) in tall-building zones = policy support for intensification
- 10-30 properties expected (Zone 1-2) - reasonable for airspace opportunities
- Capital efficiency is key strength (£5M-£15M vs £15M-£60M for full acquisition)

---

### Codex - Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry – QSR/Retail with Lease Cliffs
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #17, Use class, Lease end date, Property floor area (sqft), Sales listing price
- ✅ Syntax correct: `is one of [E(b), E]`, date (before 2027-12-31), sqft >5,000, price range
- ✅ Units correct: sqft, price
- ✅ Capital feasible: £7M-£18M acquisition + £140-£210/sqft refurb

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Lease expiry discount (10-15%) + MA/ZA conversion uplift = 18-25% margin achievable
- ✅ Implementation viable: E(b) captures QSR/food retail, expiring covenant = motivation without heavy distress stigma
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Dual PD paths (MA or ZA) improve optionality

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Pattern 20A (Lease event-driven)**: Income cliff creates negotiation leverage
- Branded units often over-rented = opportunity to rebase and repurpose
- 15-40 properties expected (Zone 2) - reasonable for lease expiry opportunities
- Residual contamination (kitchens) flagged appropriately as limitation

---

### Gemini - Approach A: The Liquidation Arbitrage
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #32, Company status, Sales listing price, Property floor area (sqft), Planning constraints
- ✅ Syntax correct: `is one of [Liquidation, Administration]`, constraint exclusion, price/area ranges
- ✅ Units correct: sqft (>10,000), price (£10M-£60M)
- ✅ Capital feasible: £20M-£60M acquisition range

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: 20-30% liquidation discount + Class MA conversion = high margin potential
- ✅ Implementation viable: Liquidators are professional, fast-moving sellers (aligns with Landmass capability)
- ✅ Deal structure sound: As-is sales typical but Landmass has refurb expertise

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Identical strategic pattern to Claude A and Codex A** but with constraint filter added
- Constraint exclusion (Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland) is appropriate
- 5-15 properties expected - realistic for liquidation + £10M+ price floor

---

### Gemini - Approach B: The Regulatory Airspace Play
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #23, Max building height (m), Number of leaseholds, Latest sold date, Sales listing currently on market
- ✅ Syntax correct: Height <15m, leaseholds <2, date (before 2010-01-01), on market = No
- ✅ Units correct: metres for height
- ✅ Capital feasible: £2M-£10M airspace rights acquisition

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Low capital entry + airspace floors = high ROI on limited capital
- ✅ Implementation viable: Off-market approach to long-term owners (15+ years) = receptive to creative deal
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Airspace rights negotiation is standard practice

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Off-market focus** (Sales listing = No) is strategic for airspace negotiations
- Simple ownership structure (leaseholds <2) reduces negotiation complexity
- 10-25 properties expected (Zone 1) - reasonable for off-market airspace

---

### Gemini - Approach C: The EPC Compliance Squeeze
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #67, Sales listing price, EPC rating, Latest sold date, Property floor area (sqft)
- ✅ Syntax correct: EPC list `[F, G]`, date (before 2015-01-01), price/area ranges
- ✅ Units correct: sqft, price
- ✅ Capital feasible: £5M-£20M acquisition + refurb

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: EPC F/G = cannot legally rent (forced action) + long hold (10+ years) = discount + refurb margin
- ✅ Implementation viable: Regulatory pressure (MEES) creates urgency, Landmass refurb expertise solves problem
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Approach framed as "solving owner's problem" = negotiation leverage

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Regulatory motivation** (EPC F/G = illegal to rent) is very strong
- 20-40 properties expected (Zone 2) - realistic for low EPC + long hold
- F/G focus (vs D/E) is appropriate - stronger motivation

---

### Grok - Approach A: Class MA Commercial Conversion Opportunities
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ Most filters exist: Preset #32, Sales listing price, Property floor area (sqft), EPC rating, Ownership type, Planning constraints, Latest sold date
- ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUE:** `Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 40000000`
  - Correct syntax structure, but learnings show compound AND can sometimes fail to parse
  - If failure occurs, split into two lines

**Suggested Fix (if needed):**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000
2. Sales listing price: is less than 40000000
```

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: PD speed (12-18 months) + poor EPC motivation + corporate ownership (divestment) = 20-30% margin in Zone 2
- ✅ Implementation viable: Class MA proven route, 2,000-40,000 sqft = 6-60 flats (manageable scale)
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Corporate ownership often indicates portfolio rationalization opportunities

**Capital Feasibility:**
- ✅ £10M-£40M acquisition + £3M-£8M refurb = within £60M total budget
- ✅ Zone 2 focus (via price range) aligns with Landmass strategy

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Motivation stacking**: EPC E/F/G (cannot rent) + Long hold (before 2015) + Corporate ownership
- 15-40 properties expected (Zone 2) - reasonable
- 60-70% viable rate after PD eligibility screening is realistic

---

### Grok - Approach B: Airspace Development on Commercial Buildings
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #23, Sales listing price, Property floor area (sqft), Max building height (m), Percentage of plot unconstrained, Lease end date, Company status
- ✅ Syntax correct: All operators correct, height <15m, percentage >70, date before 2027-12-31
- ✅ Units correct: sqft (10,000-50,000), metres for height, percentage
- ✅ Capital feasible: £15M-£60M acquisition + £5M-£15M airspace + £4M-£10M refurb = £24M-£85M (stretches upper budget but manageable)

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Liquidation/administration (20-30% discount) + airspace floors (£2k-£4k/sqft Zone 1) = strong margin
- ✅ Implementation viable: **Dual motivation** (expiring lease income cliff + liquidation forced sale)
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Existing utilities/access reduce development costs

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Strongest motivation stack in Grok approaches**: Lease expiry + Liquidation/Administration
- Percentage unconstrained >70% is smart addition (room for development)
- 10-25 properties expected (Zone 1-2) - realistic for airspace + distress combination

---

### Grok - Approach C: Distressed Office Blocks with Low EPC
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
- ✅ All filters exist: Preset #67, Sales listing price, Property floor area (sqft), Ownership type, Planning constraints, Latest sold date, Number of leaseholds
- ✅ Syntax correct: All operators correct, sqft range (5,000-30,000), date (before 2010-01-01), leaseholds <3
- ✅ Units correct: sqft, price
- ✅ Capital feasible: £8M-£35M acquisition + £3M-£7M conversion = £11M-£42M

**Business Case:**
- ✅ ROI calculation: Low EPC (cannot rent + high energy costs) + long hold (15+ years) + corporate ownership = 25-30% margin achievable
- ✅ Implementation viable: Simple freehold (leaseholds <3) reduces legal complexity
- ✅ Deal structure sound: Approach framed as EPC compliance solution = negotiation leverage

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Motivation double-stack**: Low EPC (regulatory pressure) + Long corporate hold (trapped equity)
- Zone 2 focus (£5M-£35M) appropriate for office conversions
- 20-50 properties expected - realistic for low EPC offices in Zone 2
- Leasehold <3 filter is smart (reduces ownership complexity)

---

## STRATEGIC DIVERSITY ANALYSIS

### ✅ Excellent Diversity Across 6+ Strategic Categories

**1. Precedent-Based (PD Routes):**
- Claude A, D (Class MA)
- Codex A, C (Class MA, ZA)
- Gemini A (Class MA)
- Grok A (Class MA)

**2. Capital-Efficient Structures (Airspace):**
- Claude B (Low-rise airspace + long hold)
- Codex B (Airspace + unbroken freeholds)
- Gemini B (Airspace + off-market)
- Grok B (Airspace + liquidation)

**3. Motivation-Driven (Distress/Time):**
- All Claude approaches (liquidation, long hold, lease expiry, EPC)
- All Codex approaches (liquidation, EPC, lease expiry)
- All Gemini approaches (liquidation, long hold, EPC)
- All Grok approaches (EPC, long hold, liquidation, lease expiry)

**4. Regulation-Driven:**
- Claude D, Gemini C, Grok A, C (EPC compliance pressure)
- Codex C (Lease expiry = income regulation)

**5. Time/Information Arbitrage:**
- Codex C (Brand covenant expiry)
- Grok B (Lease expiry + liquidation timing)
- Claude C (Lease expiry high footfall)

**6. Niche Opportunities:**
- Claude E (Grey Belt previously developed)
- Gemini B (Off-market airspace)

### Minimal Overlap (Good):
- **Class MA + Liquidation appears 4 times** (Claude A, Codex A, Gemini A, Grok A implicit) - but each adds unique layers:
  - Claude A: Freehold focus
  - Codex A: Adds EPC + unbroken title
  - Gemini A: Adds constraint exclusion
  - Grok A: Adds corporate ownership + long hold
  
- **Airspace appears 4 times** (Claude B, Codex B, Gemini B, Grok B) - but each targets different motivation:
  - Claude B: Long hold + low EPC
  - Codex B: Low-rise in tall zones + unbroken freeholds
  - Gemini B: Off-market + long hold
  - Grok B: Liquidation + lease expiry

**This overlap is STRATEGIC, not redundant** - same base strategy with different execution angles.

## RECOMMENDED PRIORITIZATION (By Technical + Business Strength)

### Tier 1: Highest Conviction (Execute First)
1. **Claude D** - Office Multi-Motivation (Triple stack: vacant + EPC + long hold, 60-80% viable)
2. **Claude A** - Class MA Liquidation (Forced sale + PD route, 60-80% viable)
3. **Codex A** - Class MA + Liquidation + EPC + Unbroken Title (Quadruple efficiency stack)
4. **Gemini C** - EPC Compliance Squeeze (F/G = cannot rent, regulatory pressure)

### Tier 2: Strong with Minor Conditionals
5. **Grok A** - Class MA + EPC + Long Hold (Conditional on compound AND parsing)
6. **Claude E** - Grey Belt Liquidation (Conditional on compound AND parsing, high margin 30-40%)

### Tier 3: Capital-Efficient Airspace (Lower volume but high ROI)
7. **Codex B** - Airspace + Unbroken Freeholds + Pattern 5A (Clean execution)
8. **Gemini B** - Airspace + Off-Market + Long Hold (Creative negotiation)
9. **Claude B** - Airspace + PTAL + Low EPC (Policy support)
10. **Grok B** - Airspace + Liquidation + Lease Expiry (Dual motivation, capital stretch)

### Tier 4: Specialized Opportunities
11. **Codex C** - Brand Covenant Expiry (Time-based, dual PD paths)
12. **Claude C** - High Footfall Retail Expiry (Prime locations, competitive)
13. **Grok C** - Distressed Office Low EPC (Zone 2 scale)
14. **Gemini A** - Liquidation Arbitrage (Similar to Claude A)

---

## CONCLUSION

**All 14 approaches are technically sound and business-viable.** The two CONDITIONAL approaches (Claude E, Grok A) require only minor syntax adjustments (splitting compound AND statements) if SearchLand AI fails to parse them - a 30-second fix.

**Strategic diversity is excellent** - approaches span 6 strategic categories with minimal redundant overlap. The Class MA + Liquidation pattern appears multiple times, but each LLM adds unique refinement layers (EPC, unbroken title, constraints, corporate ownership), making them complementary rather than redundant.

**Recommended execution order**: Start with Tier 1 (highest conviction, proven motivation stacks), then Tier 2 (minor conditionals), then Tier 3 (airspace - lower volume but capital-efficient), then Tier 4 (specialized timing-based opportunities).

**Next step**: Run Tier 1 approaches in SearchLand with Zone 1-2 LPA filters applied, export top 20 per approach, desktop feasibility screening.

### Critique_Codex

**Claude – Approach A:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Uses existing MA preset; filters (price £5m–£60m, liquidation/administration, 10k–100k sqft, freehold) are syntactically sound and match strategy/budget; units correct; PD route viable.  
**Technical Issues:** None spotted.  
**Suggested Fixes:** n/a  
**Strategic Notes:** Ensure MA constraints (noise/parking/daylight) checked in feasibility.

**Claude – Approach B:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Airspace preset + low height/old hold/low EPC/strong PTAL fits airspace strategy and budget; units correct. Key risk is filter naming: “Max building height on title (m)” must match available field; otherwise prompt may be ignored.  
**Technical Issues:** Possible mismatch on height filter name; PTAL values require London context.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Use exact field label as in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md (e.g., `Max building height (m)` if that’s the canonical name); confirm PTAL filter availability in the chosen LPA list.  
**Strategic Notes:** Add structural-capacity screen early.

**Claude – Approach C:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Lease-expiry + footfall preset aligns; PTAL/height/freehold filters are coherent. Missing explicit MA/Use Class filter, so PD/resi viability not guaranteed; conservation/listed exclusions help but not sufficient.  
**Technical Issues:** None on syntax; viability risk due to missing MA/use-class constraint.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Add `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]` (or relevant class) plus MA eligibility check if required.  
**Strategic Notes:** Consider vacancy window (e.g., lease ending <6–12 months) for motivation.

**Claude – Approach D:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** MA-eligible office preset plus EPC D–G, long-hold date, PTAL 4–6b, and constraint exclusions; syntax and units correct; budget and PD path consistent.  
**Technical Issues:** None spotted.  
**Suggested Fixes:** n/a  
**Strategic Notes:** Keep Flood Zone 2 tolerance decision explicit per scheme.

**Claude – Approach E:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Grey Belt preset + commercial use + <1km station + liquidation + 0.5–3 acres matches strategy/budget; units fine. Planning risk in GB is high; relies on “previously developed” exception and liquidation motivation.  
**Technical Issues:** None on syntax; ensure “Use class: contains any” is supported for this preset.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Add `Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Flood Zone 3]` and include % hardstanding/previously developed verification in workflow.  
**Strategic Notes:** Pre-app mandatory; model longer timelines/affordable housing.

**Codex – Approach A:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** MA preset with size, price £10m–£60m, EPC E–G, liquidation/administration, unbroken freehold aligns to PD distress strategy and capital. Syntax risks on price and company status labels.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- `Sales listing price: is between …` may not be a valid operator (should use two conditions).  
- `Company status: Administration` likely needs exact value `In Administration`.  
- Confirm exact field name `Number of leaseholds on the freehold`.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Use `Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND less than 60000000`.  
- Set `Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]`.  
- Verify leasehold-count field name matches AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md.

**Codex – Approach B:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Airspace preset with low height, unbroken freehold, price £5m–£20m aligns; units fine. Same operator/field-name risks as Approach A.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- `Sales listing price: is between …` operator may be invalid.  
- Height field likely `Max building height on title (m)` (verify).  
- Confirm leasehold-count field name.  
**Suggested Fixes:** Use two price bounds; ensure correct height and leasehold field labels.

**Codex – Approach C:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Lease-expiry preset; targets E(b)/E use, lease cliff, size, price; suits capital. Missing explicit PD eligibility and uses potentially invalid use-class values/operators.  
**Technical Issues:**  
- Use class values should use full labels (e.g., `E(b) - Sale of food and drink`, `E - Commercial Business and Service`) with `contains any`.  
- `Sales listing price: is between …` operator risk.  
- No MA/ZA eligibility filter; may surface protected uses.  
**Suggested Fixes:**  
- Replace use-class line with `Use class: contains any [E(b) - Sale of food and drink, E - Commercial Business and Service]`.  
- Use price bounds with > and <.  
- Add `Property classification: does not contain [C3]` or MA-eligibility constraint if targeting PD.  
- Optionally add constraint exclusions (e.g., `Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]`) for deliverability.

Residual risks across all approaches: need confirmation of exact filter names from `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`; ensure London PTAL-only filters are paired with LPA filters; and model MEES/EPC upgrade costs in ROI to maintain stated margins.

Here is the technical and business case validity review for each approach.

### Claude_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically and logically sound. All specified filters (`Sales listing price`, `Company status`, `Property floor area (sqft)`, `Tenure`) exist, use correct syntax and units as per the reference documentation. The business case strongly connects the "liquidation" filter to achieving below-market-value acquisitions, which is a core pillar of the strategy.

---

### Claude_Approaches - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is technically valid. All filters (`Max building height on title (m)`, `Latest sold date`, `EPC rating`, `PTAL`, `Planning constraints`) are documented and used with correct syntax. The business logic is coherent, combining physical characteristics (low-rise buildings) with motivation signals (long hold, low EPC) and policy support indicators (high PTAL).

---

### Claude_Approaches - Approach C: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically valid. All filters (`PTAL`, `Max building height on title (m)`, `Planning constraints`, `Tenure`) exist and are used with the correct syntax. The business strategy of targeting properties with expiring leases in high-footfall areas is a well-defined and viable commercial real estate strategy.

---

### Claude_Approaches - Approach D: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a technically and logically robust approach. All filters (`EPC rating`, `Latest sold date`, `PTAL`, `Planning constraints`, `Company status`) exist and are syntactically correct. The strategy of "stacking" multiple motivation signals (vacancy, low EPC, long ownership) is a sophisticated and effective method for identifying highly motivated sellers.

---

### Claude_Approaches - Approach E: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The approach is strategically sound but relies on `PRESET: #7 "Grey Belt"`, which is not explicitly defined in the provided reference materials. While "Grey Belt" is a known industry term for previously developed land within the Green Belt, its existence as a specific preset is an assumption. The refinement filters themselves are all technically valid.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The existence and exact function of `PRESET: #7 "Grey Belt"` is unconfirmed by the documentation.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- To guarantee execution, the search can be explicitly constructed without the preset by using `Planning constraints: contains any [Green Belt]` and `Developed area percentage: is greater than 25` as a base, before adding the other refinement filters.

---

### Codex_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is technically valid. All filters (`Property floor area (sqft)`, `Sales listing price`, `EPC rating`, `Company status`, `Number of leaseholds on the freehold`) exist and use correct syntax. The strategy effectively combines distress signals (liquidation, low EPC) with a filter for simple ownership structures (`Number of leaseholds... < 1`), which is a strong method for identifying viable and less complex deals.

---

### Codex_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is strong, but its execution has a minor technical issue and a logical gap. The strategy relies on targeting "tall building zones," but the documentation confirms there is no direct filter for this, requiring manual geographic selection by the user—a step not mentioned in the implementation notes.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Minor filter name mismatch: `Max building height (m)` should be `Max building height on title (m)` as per the documentation.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct the filter name to `Max building height on title (m)`.
- Add an implementation note: "This search must be manually executed within LPAs known to have tall building policies, as this cannot be filtered for directly."

---

### Codex_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The business logic is sound, but the `Use class` filter is technically flawed. It uses shorthand values (`E(b)`, `E`) instead of the full, required names (e.g., `E(b) - Sale of food and drink`). This is a common failure point and will likely cause the filter to fail or produce incorrect results.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Use class` filter uses shorthand values, not the full names required by SearchLand.
- `is one of [E(b), E]` is redundant; filtering for the parent `E` class already includes the `E(b)` sub-class.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Update the filter to use the full names, for example: `Use class: contains any [E(b) - Sale of food and drink]`. If the goal is to capture all E-class properties, it should be `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Business and Service]`.

---

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach A: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The approach is logically excellent and the filters are correct. However, the syntax used to declare the preset, `[#32 "..." ]`, includes square brackets which may be invalid, as other examples do not use them.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The syntax for declaring the base preset `[#32 ...]` may be invalid.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Standardize the preset declaration to `START WITH PRESET: #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"` to ensure it parses correctly.

---

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** A very strong, capital-efficient strategy. The filters are correct, including the assumed valid use of `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No` to find off-market deals. The only potential issue is the non-standard preset declaration syntax.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The syntax for declaring the base preset `[#23 ...]` may be invalid.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Standardize the preset declaration to `START WITH PRESET: #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"`.

---

### Gemini_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The logic is excellent, correctly identifying regulatory pressure as a key motivator for sellers. The filters are all valid. The only potential flaw is the non-standard syntax used for the preset declaration.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The syntax for declaring the base preset `[#67 ...]` may be invalid.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Standardize the preset declaration to `START WITH PRESET: #67 "Offices with low EPC"`.

---

### Grok_Approaches - Approach A: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is logically sound but technically invalid due to incorrect syntax for numeric range filters. The prompts for `Sales listing price` and `Property floor area (sqft)` use a duplicated `is` operator, which does not match the required `is greater than X AND less than Y` format.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Incorrect syntax for numeric ranges. For example, `Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 40000000`.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct the syntax for all numeric ranges, e.g., `Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 40000000`.

---

### Grok_Approaches - Approach B: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The strategy is strong, but like the previous Grok approach, it is technically invalid. The `Sales listing price` and `Property floor area (sqft)` filters use incorrect syntax for defining a numeric range.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Incorrect syntax for numeric ranges.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct the syntax for all numeric ranges, e.g., `Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND less than 50000`.

---

### Grok_Approaches - Approach C: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is coherent, but it is technically invalid. It repeats the same syntactical error for numeric range filters (`Sales listing price` and `Property floor area (sqft)`) seen in Grok's other approaches.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Incorrect syntax for numeric ranges.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct the syntax for all numeric ranges, e.g., `Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 35000000`.
