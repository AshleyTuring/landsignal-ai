I'll generate multiple unique property search strategies for Landmass London based on the requirements and reference materials provided.

# Property Search Strategies for Landmass London

**Generated:** 2025-12-16  
**Client:** Landmass London (Luxury residential development)  
**Focus:** Zone 1-2 London, £5M-£60M, Permitted Development + distressed assets  
**Target Margin:** 20%+ (minimum 15%)

---

## Strategic Overview

Based on the requirements, I'm focusing on:
1. **Permitted Development routes** (Class MA, airspace) - reduces planning risk
2. **Strong seller motivation signals** (liquidation, EPC, lease expiry) - creates margin
3. **Zone 1-2 pricing** (£5M-£60M range)
4. **Distressed/unmodernized assets** - Landmass's refurb expertise = margin creation

---

## Approach A: Class MA Liquidation Plays (High Conviction)

**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (liquidation) + Scale (price range) + Geography (Zone 1-2)  
**Strategic Pattern:** Regulation-driven PD + Forced sale motivation  
**Capital Required:** £10M-£60M acquisition + £2M-£8M refurb  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
5. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 60000000
6. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
7. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND less than 100000
8. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#32):** E commercial → residential PD, built-up areas, avoids major constraints
- **Liquidation filter:** VERY strong motivation (forced sale, 20-30% discount potential)
- **Price range:** £5M-£60M = Zone 1-2 commercial buildings
- **Size:** 10,000-100,000 sqft (15-150 flats at conversion)
- **Freehold:** Simpler than leasehold for PD conversion
- **Expected viable rate:** 60-80% (liquidation = real motivation, MA = proven route)

**Strengths:**
- Maximum seller motivation (liquidator obligated to sell)
- PD route = faster than planning (12-18 months vs 24-36)
- Large buildings = scale for Landmass's expertise
- Price range matches budget exactly
- Precedent: Class MA is established route (SearchLand calculates profit)

**Limitations:**
- Small pool (liquidations rare but extremely high quality)
- May require quick decision (liquidator timeline)
- Some buildings may have tenant complications
- Structural surveys essential (deferred maintenance likely)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Export results, prioritize by location (Westminster, City, Camden first)
2. Immediate contact with liquidator/administrator (speed advantage)
3. Structural survey within 2 weeks
4. Offer 15-25% below market (liquidator motivated)
5. Prior approval application (56 days)
6. Refurb to luxury spec (Landmass strength)
7. Exit: £2,000-£4,000/sqft Zone 1, £1,000-£2,000/sqft Zone 2

---

## Approach B: Low-Rise Airspace + Long Hold Motivation

**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (long hold + low EPC) + Scale (Zone 1-2 pricing) + Potential (low-rise)  
**Strategic Pattern:** Airspace development + Tired landlord motivation  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£20M acquisition + £3M-£10M airspace build  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
7. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
8. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#23):** Flat roof commercial, no C3 (airspace opportunity)
- **<15m height:** 3-5 storeys currently = room for 3-5 additional floors (8-storey target)
- **Sold before 2015:** 10+ year hold = tired landlord, trapped equity
- **Low EPC (D-G):** Improvement pressure + motivation signal
- **PTAL 4-6b:** High transport = policy support for height + residential demand
- **NOT conservation/listed:** Clean planning path for airspace
- **Expected viable rate:** 40-60% (strong motivation + clear upside)

**Strengths:**
- Airspace = lower capital than full acquisition (negotiate air rights)
- PTAL 4-6b = planning policy supports tall buildings
- Long hold + low EPC = double motivation
- Flat roof = existing structure verified (preset filter)
- Zone 1-2 focus via PTAL filter

**Limitations:**
- Structural capacity unknown until survey (£10k-£20k)
- Freeholder negotiation required (may be difficult)
- Party wall agreements needed
- Construction staging complex (occupied building below)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Identify buildings with 10+ year holds
2. Approach freeholder: "Your building needs £100k EPC upgrade, let's add value instead"
3. Option agreement for air rights (£100k-£500k)
4. Structural engineer assessment
5. Planning application for 3-5 additional storeys
6. Construction: Modern Methods (offsite, quick install)
7. Sell new flats at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (Zone 1) or £1,000-£2,000/sqft (Zone 2)

---

## Approach C: Expired Lease + High Footfall Retail Conversion

**Base Preset:** #46 "High footfall retail expiring leases"  
**Refinements Applied:** Geography (Zone 1-2) + Use class (conversion potential)  
**Strategic Pattern:** Income cliff motivation + High-value location  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£30M acquisition + £2M-£10M conversion  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (prime locations)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #46 "High footfall retail expiring leases"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
3. PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 6
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
6. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#46):** 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location), lease expiring (motivation)
- **PTAL 5-6b:** Zone 1-2 London (premium locations)
- **>6m height:** Multi-storey building (ground retail + upper floors conversion)
- **NOT conservation/listed:** Clean planning for change of use
- **Freehold:** Full control for conversion
- **Expected viable rate:** 50-70% (high footfall = valuable, but some will re-let)

**Strengths:**
- Prime locations (6,000+ footfall = Oxford Street, Bond Street, King's Cross level)
- Lease expiry = landlord motivated (void risk approaching)
- Ground floor retail value retained (can re-let or sell)
- Upper floors → luxury residential (Class MA or planning)
- Footfall data = quantified value (less speculation)

**Limitations:**
- Prime locations = competitive (other buyers interested)
- Some landlords will find new tenants (motivation gone)
- Retail values declining (high street challenges)
- May require planning if not MA-eligible

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for PTAL 5-6b (Zone 1-2)
2. Target leases expiring in 3-6 months (peak motivation)
3. Approach: "Avoid void, sell now, we close in 30 days"
4. Acquire at 10-20% discount (void risk premium)
5. Ground floor: Re-let to coffee/convenience (stable income)
6. Upper floors: Class MA conversion OR planning for residential
7. Sell flats at £2,000-£4,000/sqft (prime locations)

---

## Approach D: Office-to-Resi with Multiple Motivations (Stacking Signals)

**Base Preset:** #68 "Offices with no C3 and no lease"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (EPC + long hold) + Scale (Zone 1-2) + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Class MA + Multiple motivation signals  
**Capital Required:** £8M-£40M acquisition + £3M-£12M conversion  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #68 "Offices with no C3 and no lease"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
5. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G, D]
6. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
7. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
9. Company status: is one of [Active]
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#68):** E(g)(i) offices, no C3 (MA eligible), lease ended/no leaseholds (vacant = strongest)
- **Low EPC (D-G):** Cannot rent until improved (£50k-£200k cost) = motivation
- **Sold before 2010:** 15+ year hold = trapped equity, tired ownership
- **PTAL 4-6b:** Zone 1-2, residential demand, policy support
- **NOT Flood Zone 3:** Major planning blocker eliminated
- **Active company:** Avoid dissolved (title complications)
- **Expected viable rate:** 60-80% (multiple motivations stacked)

**Strengths:**
- **Triple motivation:** Vacant (no income) + Low EPC (can't rent) + Long hold (tired)
- Class MA route = proven (no planning risk)
- 10-30m height = substantial buildings (scale)
- PTAL filter = Zone 1-2 focus
- Vacant = immediate possession (no tenant complications)

**Limitations:**
- Vacant = carrying costs for seller (but also for you during conversion)
- May have deferred maintenance (survey critical)
- Office market weak (but that's the opportunity)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Export results, prioritize vacant buildings (no lease = immediate)
2. Approach: "Your vacant office costs £X/month, needs £100k EPC, we solve both problems"
3. Offer 15-20% below market (stacked motivations)
4. Class MA prior approval (56 days)
5. Refurbishment to luxury residential (Landmass strength)
6. Exit: 50-100 flats at £1,500-£3,500/sqft depending on zone

---

## Approach E: Grey Belt Fringe Conversion (Lower Competition)

**Base Preset:** #7 "Grey Belt"  
**Refinements Applied:** Motivation (liquidation) + Use class (commercial conversion) + Transport  
**Strategic Pattern:** Previously developed GB exception + Forced sale  
**Capital Required:** £3M-£15M acquisition + £2M-£8M development  
**Expected Results:** 5-12 properties (niche opportunity)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #7 "Grey Belt"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
7. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
9. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 3
```

**Rationale:**
- **Base preset (#7):** 25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed in GB)
- **Commercial use:** Conversion to residential (policy support for housing)
- **<1km train:** Zone 2-3 fringe, residential demand
- **Liquidation:** Maximum motivation (forced sale)
- **0.5-3 acres:** Manageable scale for £3M-£15M range
- **Expected viable rate:** 40-60% (GB still challenging, but precedent exists)

**Strengths:**
- **Lower competition:** Many avoid Green Belt entirely (opportunity)
- Previously developed = planning exception (established case law)
- Liquidation = 20-30% discount potential
- Commercial → residential = value uplift
- Fringe locations = lower acquisition, still in Greater London

**Limitations:**
- Green Belt planning still difficult (local opposition)
- Longer timelines (18-24 months for planning)
- May need affordable housing (Section 106)
- Transport <1km essential (without it, planning very hard)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Target properties with planning precedent (search "Proposal" for similar approvals)
2. Liquidator contact (immediate, before marketed)
3. Planning consultant pre-app (confirm previously developed status)
4. Offer at 20-30% discount (liquidation + GB risk)
5. Full planning application (demonstrate housing need, brownfield priority)
6. 18-24 months to consent
7. Build-out or sell with planning (25-50% value uplift on planning alone)

### Codex_Approaches

**Approach A: Class MA – Liquidation, Low EPC, Unbroken Freeholds (Zone 1 price band)**
**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"  
**Refinements Applied:** Size + Motivation + Title simplicity  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (PD conversion)  
**Capital Required:** £15M-£35M acquisition; £150-£220/sqft fit-out; £0.8M-£1.2M fees/contingency  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties (Zone 1 LPAs after user geography filter)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
**START WITH PRESET:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"  
**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
2. Sales listing price: is between 10000000 and 60000000
3. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
4. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
5. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Targets PD-eligible commercial blocks large enough for 15-60 luxury units; combines distress (liquidation + EPC E-G) with title simplicity (Pattern 23A) to avoid assembly risk. Price band aligned to Zone 1 budgets; PD path and unbroken freehold support faster completion and margin creation via refurbishment uplift.  
**Strengths:** PD route reduces planning risk; double-motivation stack (EPC + liquidation) for discount; clean titles accelerate execution.  
**Limitations:** Liquidation stock may have data gaps; EPC E-G may imply higher MEP capex; PD prior approval still needs transport/daylight checks.  
**Implementation Strategy:** Run preset with filters, export liquidation cases, triage for unbroken titles and vacancy; model GDV at £2k-£4k/sqft with 20-25% gross margin target, stress-test for MEES upgrade costs.

---

**Approach B: Airspace – Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones, Unbroken Freeholds (Zone 1-2)**
**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"  
**Refinements Applied:** Height mismatch + Title simplicity + Capacity  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (airspace uplift)  
**Capital Required:** £5M-£15M airspace/freehold; £180-£250/sqft shell & core for additional floors; £0.5M-£1M fees/contingency  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (Zone 1-2 LPAs after user geography filter)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"  
**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Max building height (m): is less than 12
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Sales listing price: is between 5000000 and 20000000
```

**Rationale:** Uses Pattern 5A (low-rise in tall zones) to find under-built commercial blocks with flat roofs; unbroken freehold (Pattern 23A) removes rooftop negotiation risk. Smaller ticket (<£20M) aligns to Zone 2/edge Zone 1; airspace adds 1-3 floors where policy supports height.  
**Strengths:** Lower capital vs full acquisition; planning precedent in tall zones improves approval odds; title simplicity reduces timeline risk.  
**Limitations:** Structural capacity and rights of light are gating; some stock may be conservation-adjacent; lender appetite for airspace can vary.  
**Implementation Strategy:** Run preset with height cap and title filter, prioritize post-1970 frames with flat roofs; commission structural desktop + Daylight/Sunlight/ROOFL analysis early; model £1k-£2k/sqft exits for new floors and target 20%+ blended margin.

---

**Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry – QSR/Retail with Lease Cliffs (Zone 2, MA or ZA)**
**Base Preset:** #17 "Commercial with expiring leases"  
**Refinements Applied:** Use-type focus + Size + Motivation  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (lease event-driven repurpose; Pattern 20A)  
**Capital Required:** £7M-£18M acquisition; £140-£210/sqft strip/refit or shell for MA/ZA; £0.6M-£1.0M fees/contingency  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (Zone 2 LPAs after user geography filter)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
**START WITH PRESET:** #17 "Commercial with expiring leases"  
**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Use class: is one of [E(b), E]
2. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000
4. Sales listing price: is between 5000000 and 20000000
```

**Rationale:** Targets QSR/retail/office hybrids with imminent lease expiry (income cliff) to unlock MA or ZA rebuild. E(b)/E captures branded units; expiring covenant increases negotiation leverage and allows repurposing to luxury resi. Size >5k sqft delivers 20-40 units in Zone 2 at £1k-£2k/sqft GDV.  
**Strengths:** Time-based motivation without heavy distress stigma; branded units often over-rented → rebase and repurpose; dual PD paths (MA or ZA) improve optionality.  
**Limitations:** Some leases may have renewal rights; residual contamination (kitchens) to check; signage/rights must be cleared.  
**Implementation Strategy:** Pull expiring leases list, segment by brand; approach landlords pre-expiry for option/conditional contracts; run dual appraisal (retain shell vs ZA uplift) and pursue prior approval early; target 18-25% margin via lease-event discount + change-of-use value jump.

### Approach A: The Liquidation Arbitrage

**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"
**Refinements Applied:** Seller Motivation (Liquidation) + Financial (Price) + Scale (Size)
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Distressed Asset Acquisition)
**Capital Required:** £20M - £60M (Acquisition of entire asset at a significant discount)
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (highly targeted)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** [#32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"]

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
2. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND less than 60000000
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
4. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets the strongest possible seller motivation: forced sales by a liquidator or administrator. Such sellers are legally obligated to sell and prioritize speed and certainty over maximizing price, creating opportunities for discounts of 20-30%. By layering this motivation filter on top of the "Class MA eligible" preset, we directly source commercial-to-residential conversion opportunities from the most distressed sellers. The price and size filters align the search with Landmass's capital allocation for larger Zone 1 projects. The expected viable rate is very high, as the primary barrier (seller motivation) is pre-qualified.

**Strengths:**
- **Highest Motivation:** Directly targets legally forced sales, offering the greatest potential for below-market-value acquisitions and high profit margins.
- **Speed Certainty:** Liquidators are fast-moving, professional sellers, which aligns with Landmass's ability to transact quickly.
- **Reduced Competition:** The pool of developers with the capital and risk appetite for £10M+ liquidation deals is smaller.

**Limitations:**
- **Low Volume:** Properties in liquidation are rare, so this search will produce a low number of results.
- **Higher Risk:** Assets may have deferred maintenance, legal complications, or be in poor condition, requiring thorough due diligence.
- **As-Is Sales:** Properties are typically sold "as-is" with no warranties.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Run this search across Zone 1 and prime Zone 2 LPAs. Due to the rarity of these opportunities, it should be a standing search run weekly. When a property is identified, the due diligence process must be mobilized immediately, as administrators often run accelerated sales processes (30-90 days).

---
### Approach B: The Regulatory Airspace Play

**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"
**Refinements Applied:** Development Potential (Height) + Seller Motivation (Long Hold) + Financial (Off-Market)
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Capital-Efficient Intensification)
**Capital Required:** £2M - £10M (For airspace rights acquisition, not the full building)
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** [#23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"]

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 2
3. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
```

**Rationale:**
This strategy provides a capital-efficient entry into the high-value Zone 1 market by targeting only the airspace rights of existing buildings. The base preset identifies commercial buildings with flat roofs, a prerequisite for airspace development. The refinements add significant strategic value:
1.  `Max building height < 15m` targets low-to-mid-rise buildings (approx. <5 storeys) where adding 2-3+ floors is architecturally and politically more feasible.
2.  `Leaseholds < 2` ensures a simple ownership structure, making the negotiation for airspace rights with the freeholder far simpler than in a multi-let building.
3.  `Latest sold date < 2010` targets assets held for 15+ years, indicating potentially tired or passive owners who may be receptive to an offer that releases equity from their roof without selling the core asset.
4.  `Off-market` focus avoids competition and allows for a direct, creative negotiation with the owner.

**Strengths:**
- **Capital Efficiency:** Requires significantly less upfront capital than acquiring the entire freehold, lowering the barrier to entry for prime Zone 1 projects.
- **High ROI:** Profit is generated on the development of new units, while the acquisition cost is comparatively low.
- **Off-Market Advantage:** Directly approaching long-term owners creates unique opportunities that are not available on the open market.

**Limitations:**
- **Complex Negotiation:** Requires sophisticated negotiation with the existing freeholder to agree on the value and terms of the airspace rights.
- **Structural Risk:** Extensive due diligence is needed to confirm the existing structure can support additional floors.
- **Rights of Light:** Potential for disputes with neighbouring properties.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Execute this search across prime Zone 1 LPAs (Westminster, K&C). Export the list of identified properties and their owners. Initiate a direct, off-market outreach campaign with a clear proposal to purchase the airspace rights, highlighting the benefits to the freeholder (capital release, minimal disruption).

---
### Approach C: The EPC Compliance Squeeze

**Base Preset:** #67 "Offices with low EPC"
**Refinements Applied:** Seller Motivation (Long Hold) + Financial (Price) + Scale (Size)
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (Regulation-Driven Acquisition)
**Capital Required:** £5M - £20M (Acquisition of underperforming asset)
**Expected Results:** 20-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** [#67 "Offices with low EPC"]

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND less than 20000000
2. EPC rating: is one of [F, G]
3. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000
```

**Rationale:**
This approach exploits regulatory pressure. As of 2023, it is unlawful to let commercial properties with an EPC rating below E. This creates a class of distressed assets where owners must either spend significant capital on upgrades or sell. This strategy targets the most pressured owners by focusing on F and G rated buildings, which require the most expensive upgrades.

By combining the low EPC preset with a `Latest sold date > 10 years` filter, we target "tired landlords" who have held the asset long-term and are less likely to have the appetite for a costly, complex refurbishment. These owners are often highly motivated to sell to avoid a non-lettable, depreciating asset. The price and size filters focus the search on medium-sized opportunities suitable for Landmass's Zone 2 financial parameters and target of creating 20-60 luxury flats.

**Strengths:**
- **Clear Motivation:** The inability to legally let the property is a powerful, non-negotiable motivation for the seller to act.
- **Value-Add Opportunity:** Landmass's core expertise in luxury refurbishment directly solves the asset's problem (poor condition) and creates the profit margin.
- **Favorable Pricing:** The cost of required EPC upgrades can be factored into the purchase price negotiation, leading to a discount.

**Limitations:**
- **Refurbishment Complexity:** Buildings with G-ratings may have significant underlying issues beyond energy efficiency, requiring deep technical due diligence.
- **Competition:** Other value-add investors are also targeting these assets, though Landmass's focus on luxury provides a differentiated exit.
- **Vacancy Risk:** The property will likely be vacant, meaning no holding income during the planning and development phases.

**Implementation Strategy:**
Run this search across target Zone 2 LPAs (Islington, Hackney, Southwark, Tower Hamlets). Screen the results for properties with clear signs of under-investment. Approach owners or their agents with an offer that reflects the refurbishment cost and planning risk, presenting Landmass as an expert capable of taking on the complex project.

### Grok_Approaches

### Approach A: Class MA Commercial Conversion Opportunities
**Base Preset:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"  
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Motivation + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (permitted development conversion)  
**Capital Required:** Acquisition £10M-£40M (Zone 2 focus), refurbishment £3M-£8M for luxury fit-out, total £13M-£48M  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (Zone 2 priority: Tower Hamlets, Southwark, Islington)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #32 "Class MA eligible commercial sites"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 40000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000 AND is less than 40000
3. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
4. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
6. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset targets commercial buildings eligible for Class MA permitted development (E use classes, built-up areas, no major constraints). Refinements narrow to manageable scale (2,000-40,000 sqft for 6-60 flats), add strong motivation signals (poor EPC prevents rental, long corporate hold suggests divestment), and exclude planning blockers. In Zone 2, this creates 20-30% margins through PD speed and luxury refurbishment. Expected viable rate 60-70% after screening for actual PD eligibility and distress signals.

**Strengths:**
- Permitted development reduces planning risk and timeline (56 days vs 8-12 months)
- Poor EPC creates urgency (owners cannot rent until upgraded)
- Corporate ownership often indicates institutional divestment opportunities
- Scale fits luxury apartment development (20-60 units per building)

**Limitations:**
- Limited to E use classes (excludes B2/B8 offices unless mixed)
- Requires prior 2-year commercial use (check planning history)
- Zone 2 properties may have lower GDV than Zone 1 (£1,000-£2,000/sqft vs £2,000-£4,000)
- Competition from other PD seekers

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Run preset in SearchLand, apply Zone 2 LPA filters manually. Screen top 20 for PD eligibility (use class history, building age). Contact owners directly citing PD opportunity and EPC compliance costs. Target liquidation cases first (check Companies House). Aim for 3-5 acquisitions in first 6 months, focusing on buildings with flat roofs for potential airspace add-on.

### Approach B: Airspace Development on Commercial Buildings
**Base Preset:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"  
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Potential + Motivation  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (airspace intensification)  
**Capital Required:** Acquisition £15M-£60M (Zone 1-2 mix), airspace rights/build £5M-£15M, refurbishment £4M-£10M, total £24M-£85M  
**Expected Results:** 10-25 properties (Zone 1 priority: Westminster, Camden, City)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #23 "Airspace: Commercial, no resi"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 10000000 AND is less than 60000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000 AND is less than 50000
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
4. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
5. Lease end date: is before 2027-12-31
6. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, Administration]
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset finds commercial buildings with flat roofs and no residential use, ideal for airspace development. Refinements target low-rise buildings (<15m) with room to add 3-5 storeys, add scale filters for viable projects, and include motivation signals (expiring leases create income cliff, liquidation forces quick sale). In Zone 1-2, this exploits height restrictions allowing additional floors while avoiding pure residential (leaseholder complications). Expected viable rate 50-60% after structural surveys confirm capacity.

**Strengths:**
- Existing utilities and access reduce development costs
- Flat roofs enable straightforward airspace additions (PD rights)
- Liquidation/administration creates distressed pricing (20-30% discount)
- Higher Zone 1 GDV supports premium pricing (£2,000-£4,000/sqft)

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural engineering assessment (additional £10k-£50k cost)
- Freeholder negotiation needed for airspace rights
- Zone 1 competition higher (more institutional buyers)
- Planning may still be required if exceeding height limits

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Execute preset, manually filter to Zone 1 LPAs. Prioritize buildings with expiring leases (contact landlords 6-12 months pre-expiry). Use liquidation signals for quick acquisitions. Conduct initial airspace viability studies on top 10. Target 2-4 developments in first year, leveraging Landmass's refurbishment expertise for luxury finishes.

### Approach C: Distressed Office Blocks with Low EPC
**Base Preset:** #67 "Offices with low EPC"  
**Refinements Applied:** Scale + Motivation + Constraints  
**Strategic Pattern:** Development opportunity (office-to-residential conversion)  
**Capital Required:** Acquisition £8M-£35M (Zone 2 focus), conversion/refurb £3M-£7M, total £11M-£42M  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (Zone 2 priority: Hackney, Lambeth, Wandsworth)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**

**START WITH PRESET:** #67 "Offices with low EPC"

**THEN ADD THESE REFINEMENT FILTERS:**
```
1. Sales listing price: is greater than 5000000 AND is less than 35000000
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000 AND is less than 30000
3. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
4. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 3]
5. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
6. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3
```

**Rationale:**  
Base preset identifies office buildings with poor EPC ratings (D-G), indicating maintenance neglect and conversion motivation. Refinements add scale limits for manageable projects, corporate ownership for institutional distress signals, and long hold periods suggesting trapped equity. Excludes major constraints and focuses on simple freeholds. In Zone 2, offices often convert to residential via PD or planning, with luxury refurb creating 25-30% margins. Expected viable rate 55-65% after checking for viable conversion routes.

**Strengths:**
- Low EPC creates dual motivation (cannot rent + high energy costs)
- Corporate long holds often indicate portfolio rationalization
- Offices in Zone 2 often have good transport links (PTAL proxy)
- Simple freehold structures reduce legal complexity

**Limitations:**
- Offices may require full planning permission (not always PD-eligible)
- Zone 2 may have more Article 4 restrictions on conversions
- Competition from other office-to-resi converters
- Refurbishment costs higher for dated office fit-outs

**Implementation Strategy:**  
Apply preset with Zone 2 LPA filters. Screen for PD eligibility (Class MA if mixed use, or planning for pure offices). Target companies with >30 titles (portfolio divestment). Approach owners with EPC compliance costs as leverage. Secure 4-6 sites in first 6 months, focusing on buildings with potential for mixed-use (retail ground floor + residential above).

## REFERENCE MATERIALS (ALL CONTENT INCLUDED BELOW)

## REFERENCE: SearchLand Available Filters (CRITICAL - Use ONLY These)

# SearchLand Available Filters

**Source:** Direct from SearchLand interface (HTML parsed)  
 
**IMPORTANT:** ⚠️ CRITICAL: If the constrained value or permitted filter value is not in here you can still use the filter and assume what the filter value could be. This is a living document and will be updated as we use each filter - dont be afraid of using filters.

##  Filter Operators for List-Based Filters

**Many SearchLand filters use predefined value lists (not free text).** These filters have specific operators:

### Available Operators for List-Based Filters:

| Operator | Logic | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **contains any** | OR (implicit) - matches if ANY selected value is present | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| **contains all** | AND (implicit) - matches only if ALL selected values present | `Use class: contains all [E, C3]` |
| **does not contain** | Exclusion - excludes if value is present | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| **is equal to** | Exact match - only this specific value | `Use class: is equal to [E]` |

### ❌ INVALID Syntax (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Use class: E AND C3
```

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ✅ CORRECT Syntax:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]
✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** (predefined planning classes)
- **Property type** (Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.)
- **Property classification** (separate taxonomy from Use class)
- **Tenure** (Freehold, Leasehold, etc.)
- **Ownership type** (Corporate, Individual, etc.)
- Any filter showing checkbox options in the UI

### Text/Numeric Filters (Use comparison operators):
- **Title address:** `contains`, `does not contain` (free text)
- **Proposal:** `contains` (free text keyword search)
- **Title area (acres):** `is greater than`, `is less than`, `is equal to` (numeric)
- **Price:** `is greater than`, `is less than` (numeric)

## 🏷️ Sales Listing Status Values (Defined)

**Filter:** `Sales listing status`

**Important:** This filter uses predefined values from Land Registry and agent data. Understanding these statuses is critical for filtering active vs. historical listings.

| Status | Meaning | Legally Binding? | Notes |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------|
| **Available** | Property is actively for sale, open to new offers, and listed publicly. | ❌ No | Best status for finding live opportunities |
| **Under Offer** | An offer has been made and accepted by the seller, but contracts not yet exchanged. | ❌ No | Property still at risk of falling through. Some agents use this interchangeably with "Sold STC" |
| **SSTC** (Sold Subject to Contract) | Most common status in England/Wales. Buyer's offer accepted, but legal contract exchange hasn't taken place yet. | ❌ No | Either party can still withdraw until exchange |
| **SSTCM** (Sold Subject to Conclusion of Missives) | Scottish equivalent of "Sold STC". Offer accepted but formal exchange of legally binding contracts ("conclusion of missives") hasn't happened yet. | ❌ No | Scotland-specific status |
| **Reserved** | Usually seen in new-build developments. Buyer has put down a reservation fee to hold the property while contracts are drawn up. | ❌ No | Not legally binding, but property taken off open market |
| **Invisible** | **Property listing is hidden from public portals/websites** (e.g. withdrawn, archived, or not yet marketed). | ❌ No |  |
| **Sale Completed** | Transaction has been legally finalised, ownership transferred, and confirmed through Land Registry. | ✅ YES | This status comes from Land Registry records (not agents), so it's fully verified. Due to registration delays, this status can lag behind SSTC by weeks/months |

### Usage Examples:

```
✅ Find only active listings:
Sales listing status: contains any [Available]

✅ Find active + under-offer properties (broader search):
Sales listing status: contains any [Available, Under Offer, SSTC]

⚠️ Include off-market opportunities:
Sales listing status: contains any [Available, Under Offer, Invisible]

```

### ⚠️ Notes: "Invisible" Status

Properties with **"Invisible"** status are often:
- Withdrawn from market (seller changed mind)
- Historical listings (sold months/years ago but not yet showing "Sale Completed")
- Off-market opportunities (not publicly advertised)
- Archived listings (agent removed from portals)

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors. If the filter value is not document you can make some assumption about it's expected behaviour and create a filter based on that. We will test your assumption and document any discrepancies here. 

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: List-Based Filter Operators (MOST COMMON ERROR)

**ISSUE:** LLMs frequently write invalid syntax for filters with predefined value lists (Use class, Property type, etc.)

### The Problem

SearchLand filters with **predefined value lists** (shown as checkboxes in UI) use specific operators:
- `contains any` (OR logic - matches if ANY value is present)
- `contains all` (AND logic - requires ALL values)
- `does not contain` (exclusion)
- `is equal to` (exact match)

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ❌ INVALID Examples (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
   // SearchLand does not support OR operators within a filter line

❌ Use class: contains 'E' AND Use class: contains 'C3'
   // SearchLand does not support AND operators within a filter line

❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
   // Wrong syntax - no OR operators

❌ Use class: E AND C3
   // Wrong syntax - no AND operators
```

**Why This Fails:**
- SearchLand's AI prompt parser does not recognize `OR`/`AND`/`NOT` as operators
- It treats the entire string as a literal search term
- The filter will return zero results or unexpected matches

### ✅ CORRECT Examples:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Multiple values in single filter with "contains any" operator
   // This matches properties with EITHER E OR C3 (implicit OR)

✅ Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Requires BOTH E AND C3 to be present (implicit AND)

✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
   // Correct: Excludes properties with B2 use class

✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use, Residential]
   // Correct: Matches any of these property types

✅ Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
   // Correct: Exact match for single value
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** - Planning use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Property type** - Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.
- **Property classification** - Separate taxonomy from Use class
- **Tenure** - Freehold, Leasehold, etc.
- **Ownership type** - Corporate, Individual, etc.
- **Any filter showing checkbox options in UI**

### Syntax Pattern:

```
[Filter name]: [operator] [comma-separated list of values in square brackets]
```

**Examples:**
```
Use class: contains any [E, C3, C4]
Property type: does not contain [Agricultural]
Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
```

### Common Corrections:

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |
|-------------|-----------|
| `Use class: contains 'E' OR 'C3'` | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| `Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Mixed'` | `Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]` |
| `Use class: NOT 'B2'` | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| `Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'` | `Tenure: contains any [Freehold, Leasehold]` |

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**Boolean Operators in List-Based Filters:**
```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'C3'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
```
- List-based filters do NOT support `OR`, `AND`, `NOT` operators within a single filter line
- **Correct:** `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]`
- Use `contains any` for OR logic, `contains all` for AND logic

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

**Numeric Value Precision - Floating Point Conversion ⚠️**
```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Approach B validation)

BEHAVIOR:
SearchLand AI may convert integer values to floating-point precision internally.

EXAMPLE:
Your prompt:
  Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000

SearchLand AI creates:
  Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 1999.999

OBSERVATIONS:
- Integer values (2000) may display as floating-point (1999.999)
- This is an internal precision conversion, not a parsing error
- Functionally identical: 1999.999 ≈ 2000 (no practical difference)
- Affects numeric filters: area, price, distance, etc.

IMPLICATIONS:
✅ No functional impact on search results
✅ 1999.999 and 2000 return identical properties
⚠️ Display may look different from your prompt (cosmetic only)

RECOMMENDATION:
- Accept this behavior - it's cosmetic, not functional
- Don't try to "fix" it by adjusting your prompt
- Focus on the intent (>2000 sqft) rather than exact display value

Common conversions seen:
2000 → 1999.999
5000 → 4999.999
10000 → 9999.999
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

**Building Height - Auto-Conversion Behavior ⚠️**
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
SearchLand AI may auto-convert between height metrics:
- "Max building height on title (m): is less than 12" 
  → May create "Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4"
- Conversion assumes ~3m per floor
- Both filters exist separately in SearchLand

Available Height Filters:
✅ Max building height on title (m) - absolute height in metres
✅ Max number of building floors on title - storey count
✅ Number of building floors in title - actual floor count

RECOMMENDATION:
- If you want floors, specify floors (more reliable parsing)
- If you want metres, specify metres (but verify which filter was created)
- Always check SearchLand UI to confirm which filter was applied

Example:
# If you want 3-4 storey buildings:
✅ Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4  (explicit, reliable)
⚠️ Max building height on title (m): is less than 12  (may auto-convert to floors)

Conversion Reference:
12m ≈ 3-4 floors
15m ≈ 4-5 floors  
18m ≈ 5-6 floors
25m ≈ 7-9 floors
(Assumes 3-4m per storey)
```

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Latest sold date" - No Boolean "Never Sold" Filter ⚠️
```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Approach C validation)

CRITICAL ISSUE:
SearchLand AI has NO boolean "No latest sold date" or "Never sold" filter.

COMMON MISTAKE:
Attempting to use natural language like:
❌ "No latest sold date: Yes"
❌ "Latest sold date: does not exist"
❌ "Never sold: Yes"

WHAT HAPPENS:
SearchLand AI misinterprets these as date filters with extreme values:
- "No latest sold date: Yes" → "Latest sold date: is before 01/01/1800"
- This returns virtually zero results (properties sold before 1800 are extremely rare)

WHAT YOU PROBABLY WANT:
Properties with long-term ownership (held for many years without recent sale).

CORRECT APPROACH - Use Date Proxy:
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/1950  (75+ years, very long-term holdings)
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/1980  (45+ years, long-term holdings)
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2000  (25+ years, established holdings)
✅ Latest sold date: is before 01/01/2015  (10+ years, stable ownership)

RECOMMENDED PROXY DATES BY STRATEGY:
- Legacy holdings / Estate situations: before 1950 or 1980
- Long-term private owners: before 2000
- Stable ownership (not flippers): before 2015
- Recent acquisitions: after 2020

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH - Omit Sale Date Filter:
If you're looking for motivated sellers, consider:
- Removing sale date filter entirely
- Relying on other motivation signals:
  ✅ Ownership type: Company + Company status: Liquidation
  ✅ Building on title is derelict: Yes
  ✅ Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
  ✅ Low EPC ratings (E, F, G)

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Using "No latest sold date: Yes" will return ZERO or near-zero results.
Always use a date proxy instead.

```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
When you filter for "Sui Generis" use class, SearchLand displays it as:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

CLARIFICATION:
- "Outside of the defined classes" = Sui Generis
- Sui Generis = Uses that don't fit into standard use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- Examples: Car showrooms, petrol stations, nightclubs, launderettes, taxi businesses, 
  scrap yards, casinos, theatres, amusement arcades, hostels, motor vehicle repair

Filter correctly parses when you use:
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]

Display in SearchLand UI:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

Note: This is just a display difference - the filter works correctly.
```

### "Property classification" Auto-Added by SearchLand AI
```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Approach B validation)

BEHAVIOR:
When you specify a "Use class" filter, SearchLand AI may automatically add a corresponding 
"Property classification" filter to ensure consistency.

EXAMPLE 1 - Without explicit Property classification:
Your prompt:
  Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses

SearchLand AI creates:
  1. Property classification: contains all [Residential]  (AUTO-ADDED)
  2. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]  (OPERATOR CHANGED)

EXAMPLE 2 - With explicit Property classification:
Your prompt:
  Property classification: contains all [Residential]
  Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses

SearchLand AI creates:
  1. Property classification: contains all [Residential]  (AS REQUESTED)
  2. Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]  (OPERATOR STILL CHANGED)

OBSERVATIONS:
- SearchLand AI will auto-add "Property classification" if not specified
- SearchLand AI ALWAYS prefers "contains all" operator for Use class filters
- This operator preference persists even when you explicitly include Property classification
- For single-value Use class filters: "contains all [C3]" = "is equal to C3" (functionally identical)

IMPLICATIONS:
✅ Generally helpful - adds logical consistency
⚠️ Operator will be changed from "is equal to" → "contains all" (unavoidable)
✅ Functionally equivalent for single-value filters (no impact on results)
✅ Explicitly including "Property classification" prevents auto-addition but not operator change

RECOMMENDATION:
For residential searches, explicitly include both filters:
  Property classification: contains all [Residential]
  Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses

Benefits:
- ✅ Prevents unexpected auto-addition of Property classification
- ✅ Ensures both filters are present and controlled
- ⚠️ Accept that "is equal to" will become "contains all" (no functional impact)

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Complex Multi-Line Prompts May Be Partially Ignored ⚠️ CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

ISSUE:
- When providing 8+ filter lines in a single prompt, SearchLand AI may only parse 2-3 filters
- More complex the prompt structure, higher the failure rate
- No clear pattern for which filters get dropped
- Can result in massively inflated result counts (e.g., 25,910 instead of 10-50)

Example Failure:
Prompt with 8 filters → Only 2 created (Max floors, Tenure auto-added)
Missing: Distance to station, title area, use class, sold date, applications, on market

SOLUTION:
1. **Simplify prompt structure:**
   - Separate compound AND conditions into individual lines
   - Avoid mixing multiple filter types in rapid sequence
   
2. **Break into smaller chunks:**
   - Start with 4-5 filters, verify they parse
   - Add remaining filters manually in UI if needed
   
3. **Always verify before clicking Search:**
   - Count filters created vs filters requested
   - Check filter names match what you asked for
   - Add missing filters manually using "Add Filter" button

Success Pattern (Iteration 2):
- Split "is greater than X AND less than Y" into two separate lines
- Used simpler filter names (e.g., "floors" instead of "height in metres")
- Result: 8/8 filters successfully parsed

Related: See "Multiple AND Conditions" section below
```

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably

RELIABILITY TIP (Discovered 2025-11-24):
While AND works in simple prompts, complex prompts (6+ filters) benefit from splitting:

❌ Less Reliable (in complex prompts):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5

✅ More Reliable (always parses):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25
Title area (acres): is less than 1.5

WHEN TO SPLIT:
- Complex prompts (6+ filters total)
- When other filters are failing to parse
- When you need guaranteed reliability

WHEN SINGLE LINE IS OK:
- Simple prompts (3-5 filters)
- When used alone or with minimal other filters
- Numeric ranges are the primary search criteria
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## SearchLand Presets - Case Study: Refining for Development

### "Preset #11 'Mixed use search' - Adding Scale & Constraint Filters"

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Stage 4 Validation)

CONTEXT:
User goal: Find 8-storey mixed-use development opportunities, £2M profit on £200k capital
Manual filters failed: 0 viable properties from 5 approaches
Pivot: Test SearchLand preset #11 "Mixed use search"

OBSERVATION:
Sample of 6 properties from base preset showed mixed results:
- 1/6 matched target profile (small-scale, low-rise, development opportunity)
- 5/6 were unsuitable (large institutional complexes, fully developed sites, complex ownership)

HYPOTHESIS:
Preset finds correct USE TYPE (mixed E/C3) but doesn't filter by:
- Scale (small vs. large sites)
- Development potential (low-rise vs. tall buildings)
- Ownership complexity (simple vs. multiple leaseholds)
- Planning constraints (clean vs. constrained sites)

EXPERIMENT:
Added 6 refinement filters to Preset #11 base:

1. SCALE FILTERS (to target manageable size):
   - Title area (acres): is greater than 0.04 AND less than 0.3
   - Addresses: is less than 8
   - Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 3

2. DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL FILTERS (to target upside):
   - Max building height on title (m): is less than 8
     (Reasoning: Low-rise = airspace/intensification opportunity)
   - Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 50
     (Reasoning: Room for development/expansion)

3. CONSTRAINT FILTERS (to avoid planning blockers):
   - Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
     (Reasoning: These constraints made planning approval difficult in our specific use case)

RESULTS:
- Sample of 6 properties from refined preset: 6/6 matched target profile
  - All 0.04-0.22 acres (small-scale)
  - All 3.5-6.6m height (1-2 storeys with airspace potential)
  - All E/C3 mixed-use
  - All freehold or 1-2 leaseholds (simple ownership)

CONCLUSION FOR THIS SPECIFIC CASE:
Refinement filters improved viable property rate from 1/6 (17%) to 6/6 (100%) in this sample.

POTENTIAL APPLICABILITY:
If your goal is similar (small-scale development opportunities with airspace potential):
- Consider starting with a relevant preset
- Add filters for scale, potential, and constraints based on YOUR specific requirements
- Test on a sample before assuming broad applicability

IF YOUR GOAL IS DIFFERENT:
- Investment screening (operating assets): Preset as-is may be sufficient
- Large-scale projects: Adjust scale filters (e.g., 0.2-1.0 acres, <20 addresses)
- Airspace-specific: Add "Building has flat roof: Yes", reduce height to <6m
- Conversion plays: Remove height filter, add specific use class targeting

IMPORTANT CAVEATS:
- This is ONE case study (Preset #11, mixed-use development, Slough area)
- Sample size: 6 properties validated (not statistically significant)
- Other presets may behave differently
- Your requirements may need different refinements
- Test and validate for YOUR specific use case

## SearchLand Presets - Technical Filter Analysis

### "Number of EPC Records" Filter Behavior

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22)

TECHNICAL FACT:
"Number of EPC records on title: is greater than X" is a proxy for multi-unit buildings.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Each EPC (Energy Performance Certificate) = 1 unit (residential or commercial)
- "EPC > 10" = property has 10+ separate units
- "EPC > 50" = property has 50+ separate units

EXAMPLES WHERE THIS APPEARS:
- Preset #65 "Mixed use developments" (EPC > 10)
- Preset #61 "EV Charger Multi-Address" (targets apartment buildings)
- Preset #19 "Homes to HMO" (EPC-based filtering)

PROPERTIES RETURNED TYPICALLY HAVE:
- Multiple addresses (10-100+ for EPC > 10)
- Multiple leaseholds (if subdivided for sale/rent)
- Fully developed (already multi-unit, not single building)
- Complex ownership structures

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Using "EPC > X" filter will:
- ✅ Find existing multi-unit buildings (apartments, HMOs, multi-tenant commercial)
- ❌ Exclude single buildings (even if large floor area)
- ❌ Exclude undeveloped sites (no EPCs yet)
- ❌ Exclude properties with <X units

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → "Preset #11 vs #65 Comparison" for strategic use cases
```

### Preset Filter Reference (Mixed-Use)

```
PRESET #11 "MIXED USE SEARCH":
Base filters:
- Tenure: is one of Freehold
- Use class: contains any [E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)]
- Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
- Latest sold date: is after 01/08/2019

Characteristics:
- Broad search (any mixed-use property)
- Recent transactions only
- No scale, ownership, or EPC filters
- Very flexible (few built-in assumptions)

PRESET #65 "MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS":
Base filters:
- Tenure: is one of Freehold
- Use class: contains all [C3 - Dwellinghouses, E - Commercial, Business and Service]
- Developed area (sqft): is between 5381.955 and 21527.821
- Ownership type: isn't one of [Corporate, Council, Housing Association]
- Number of EPC records on title: is greater than 10

Characteristics:
- Narrower search (specific size range: 500-2,000 sqmt)
- Excludes institutional ownership
- Targets existing multi-unit buildings (EPC > 10)
- Built-in assumptions about property type

For strategic comparison and use cases, see: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → "Comparing Similar Presets"

### Preset Filters - Common Missing Elements

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22)

TECHNICAL OBSERVATION:
Many SearchLand presets do not include filters for:
- Tenure (Freehold vs. Leasehold)
- Planning constraints (Green Belt, Flood Zones, Conservation Areas)
- Leasehold count

This means presets may return properties that are unsuitable for certain use cases.

EXAMPLES:

PRESET #19 "HOMES TO HMO":
Filters included:
- Tenure: Freehold ✅
- Use class: C3
- Number of addresses: 1
- Has an HMO: false
- Article 4: doesn't contain [restrictions]
- Ownership type: Company or Private owner
- Sales listing: false

Filter NOT included:
- Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt] ❌

Result: Returns Green Belt properties with 0% unconstrained

Sample (Slough, 3 properties tested):
- Property 1: 0.19 ac, 0% unconstrained, Strong Green Belt
- Property 2: 0.13 ac, 0% unconstrained, Strong Green Belt
- Property 3: 0.24 ac, 0% unconstrained, Strong Green Belt
- All in same geographic cluster (Little Sutton Lane area)

---

PRESET #20 "UNSOLD HOMES WITH POOR EPC":
Filters included:
- Ownership type: Company or Private owner
- Use class: C3
- Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ years)
- EPC rating: E, F, G

Filter NOT included:
- Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ❌

Result: Returns mix of Freehold and Leasehold properties

Sample (3 properties tested from base preset):
- Property 1: 0.0087 ac, Leasehold, 100% unconstrained
- Property 2: 0.12 ac, Freehold, 100% unconstrained
- Property 3: 0.049 ac, Freehold, 86.68% unconstrained
- 1/3 was Leasehold (unsuitable for development)

---

PRESET #47 "HMO OPPORTUNITIES":
Filters included:
- Tenure: Freehold ✅ (INCLUDED)
- Latest EPC habitable rooms: 8-12
- Use class: C3
- Latest sold date: before 26/11/2015 (10+ years)
- EPC rating: F, G, D, E
- Applications in last 5 years: <1
- Distance to Bus Stop: <500m
- Distance to Train Station: <1000m

Sample (6 properties tested):
- Property 1: 0.10 ac, 1 leasehold, 82.87% unconstrained, Company
- Property 2: 0.072 ac, 0 leaseholds, 100% unconstrained, Company
- Property 3: 0.27 ac, 0 leaseholds, 91.36% unconstrained, Private
- Property 4: 0.053 ac, 0 leaseholds, 100% unconstrained, Private
- Property 5: 0.09 ac, 0 leaseholds, 20.96% unconstrained, Private
- Property 6: 0.13 ac, 0 leaseholds, 100% unconstrained, Private
- 4/6 had clean ownership (0 leaseholds), 2/6 had complications

Observation: Even with Tenure: Freehold filter, "Number of leaseholds on the freehold" can be > 0

---

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Presets without tenure/constraint filters will return:
- Leaseholds mixed with Freeholds (if no tenure filter)
- Green Belt properties (if no planning constraint filter)
- Properties with leaseholders on freehold (if no leasehold count filter)

Users must manually add these filters if their use case requires:
- Development (needs Freehold, no Green Belt, clean ownership)
- Investment screening (may accept Leaseholds, constraints less critical)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → "Missing Critical Filters in Presets" for strategic guidance
```

### Preset Filters - Missing Size Constraints

```
Discovered: 2025-11-25 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v22, Preset testing continuation)

TECHNICAL OBSERVATION:
Many SearchLand presets lack both minimum AND maximum size constraints on "Title area (acres)".

EXAMPLES:

PRESET #20 "UNSOLD HOMES WITH POOR EPC" (Without size filter):
Base filters:
- Ownership type: Company or Private owner
- Use class: C3
- Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004
- EPC rating: E, F, G

Sample properties returned (without size filter):
- Property 5: 0.020 acres (871 sqft total plot) ❌ Too small
- Property 6: 0.0078 acres (340 sqft total plot) ❌ Microscopic
- Properties 1-3: 0.067-0.15 acres ✅ Workable

Viable rate (6 properties): 4/6 (67%) - 2 too small

After adding: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.5"
Sample (3 properties): 0.067-0.15 acres - all workable size
Viable rate: 3/3 (100%)

---

PRESET "AIRSPACE: COMMERCIAL, NO RESI" (Without size limit):
Base filters:
- Tenure: Freehold
- Use class: E or E(a)
- Developed area (sqft): ≥ 3229.173 (300 sqm)
- Developed area percentage: ≤ 30
- Flat roof: true
- No C3/C4

Sample properties returned (without size limit):
- Property 1: 2.98 acres (institutional scale, requires £2M+ capital) ❌
- Property 2: 11.67 acres (187,556 sqft developed, requires £10M+ capital) ❌
- Property 3: 0.27 acres (workable but 1 leasehold) ⚠️

Viable rate (3 properties): 0/3 (0%) - all too large or complex

Would benefit from: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5"

---

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
Presets without size constraints will return:
- Micro-plots unsuitable for development (<0.05 acres = <2,178 sqft)
- Institutional-scale sites requiring £5M-£20M+ capital (>2 acres)

For £200k capital projects:
- Minimum viable: 0.05 acres (2,178 sqft)
- Maximum manageable: 0.5 acres (21,780 sqft)
- Optimal range: 0.1-0.3 acres

For institutional projects (£5M+):
- Minimum: 2 acres
- Typical: 5-20 acres

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → "Size Filters Are CRITICAL" for capital-based size recommendations

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

## Newly Documented Filters (v5.2.3)

### Property Type

**Context:**
- Simple residential/commercial classification (different from "Property classification")
- Only 5 values: Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial
- Used for basic property type filtering

**Operators:** `contains all`, `contains any`, `does not contain`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property type: contains any [Detached, Semi-Detached]
Property type: contains all [Commercial, Flat]  // Mixed-use commercial flats
Property type: does not contain [Terraced]
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property type: Detached AND Semi-Detached
```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Do NOT confuse with "Property classification" (which has 500+ values)

---

### Tenure

**Context:**
- Legal ownership structure
- 5 values: Leasehold, Freehold, Pending first registration, Caution against first registration, Rentcharge
- Critical for acquisition strategy (Freehold = full ownership, Leasehold = time-limited)

**Operator:** `is one of` (implicit OR)

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Leasehold, Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Pending first registration]  // Unregistered land - potential opportunity
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'
❌ Tenure: NOT 'Leasehold'
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Freehold only:** For long-term hold/development (no ground rent complications)
- **Leasehold:** Can indicate motivated sellers (especially short leases <80 years)
- **Pending first registration:** Unregistered land - may have title issues but also opportunities

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Combine with "Lease end date" for leasehold properties to find short leases

---

### Property Classification

**Context:**
- Comprehensive taxonomy with ~500+ values across 24 major categories
- Separate from "Use class" (planning) - this is Ordnance Survey classification
- Hierarchical: Commercial > Hotel/Motel > Youth Hostel (example)
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT mix with "Use class" values

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**Major Categories:**
- Commercial, Education, Hotel/Motel, Industrial, Leisure, Medical, Animal Centre, Office, Broadcasting, Retail, Storage Land, Transport, Utility, Emergency/Rescue, Information, Land, Water, Military, Other, Parent Shell, Residential, Unclassified, Dual Use, Object of Interest

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property classification: contains any [Commercial, Residential]
Property classification: contains all [Development Site, Residential Construction Site]
Property classification: does not contain [Military, Prison]
Property classification: exactly matches [Hotel/Motel]
Property classification: contains any [Vacant / Derelict Land, Development Site]  // Opportunity sites
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property classification: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property classification: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]  // WRONG - that's Use class, not classification
❌ Property classification: Development Site AND Residential  // Use 'contains all' instead
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Development Site:** Active construction - may indicate market activity
- **Vacant / Derelict Land:** Potential redevelopment opportunities
- **Care / Nursing Home:** For care home conversion strategies
- **Hotel/Motel:** For hotel-to-residential conversions
- **Warehouse / Store / Storage Depot:** For industrial-to-residential conversions

**Performance/Notes:**
- Slower filter due to large value set - use strategically
- More granular than "Property type" but less planning-specific than "Use class"
- Can combine with "Use class" for precision (e.g., Classification: Hotel + Use class: C3 for converted hotels)

---

### PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level)

**Context:**
- London-specific metric (Transport for London)
- 9 values: 0 (Worst), 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)
- Higher = better public transport access = higher land values + planning support for density
- **CRITICAL:** Only available in London - will return zero results elsewhere

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
PTAL: contains any [6a, 6b (Best)]  // Excellent transport - supports tall buildings
PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]  // Good to excellent
PTAL: does not contain [0 (Worst), 1a, 1b]  // Exclude poor transport areas
PTAL: exactly matches [6b (Best)]  // Only the very best
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ PTAL: '6a' OR '6b'
❌ PTAL: is greater than 4  // Not a numeric filter - use 'contains any' with list
❌ PTAL: High  // Must use exact values (0, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b)
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **High-density development:** PTAL 4+ supports planning for tall buildings
- **Residential demand:** PTAL 5+ = premium pricing for car-free living
- **Planning policy:** Many London boroughs require PTAL 3+ for car-free developments
- **Opportunity:** PTAL 2-3 areas with planned transport improvements (check TfL plans)

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- **London only** - always combine with London geography filters
- Use with "Distance to nearest Train Station" for non-London areas
- PTAL ratings can change - check TfL website for planned improvements

**Related Filters:**
- Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - for non-London areas
- Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m)
- Distance to nearest Rapid Transit Stop/Station (m)

---

### Planning Constraints

**Context:**
- 34 constraint types covering environmental, heritage, policy, and flood risk
- Critical for assessing development viability
- Some are absolute blockers (Green Belt, SSSI), others provide policy support (Housing Zones)
- **IMPORTANT:** "Built up areas" is POSITIVE (urban context), not a constraint to avoid

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (34 constraints)
- **Absolute Blockers:** Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, World heritage sites, Scheduled Monuments, National Parks, National Landscapes (AONB)
- **Flood Risk:** Flood Zone 2 (negotiable), Flood Zone 3 (major blocker)
- **Policy Support (SEEK):** Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas, Areas Of Intensification, Site Allocations, Built up areas
- **Heritage:** Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer (less restrictive), Parks and Gardens, Battlefields
- **Environmental:** SAC, SPA, RAMSAR, National Nature Reserves, Local Nature Reserves, Country Parks, CROW
- **Urban Planning:** Central Activities Zone (London), SIL, LSIS, Town Center Boundaries, Designated Open Space
- **Other:** Tree Preservation Order (TPO), Nutrient Neutrality

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]  // Avoid major blockers
Planning constraints: contains any [Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas]  // Seek policy support
Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Exclude protected sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Housing Zones, Built up areas]  // Urban housing policy areas
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]  // Exclude Green Belt only
Planning constraints: contains any [Site Allocations]  // Sites allocated for development in local plan
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Planning constraints: NOT 'Green Belt'
❌ Planning constraints: 'Green Belt' OR 'Conservation Area'
❌ Planning constraints: does not contain [Built up areas]  // WRONG - Built up areas is GOOD!
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Urban Brownfield Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
   ```

2. **High-Density Development (London):**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [Central Activities Zone, Opportunity Areas]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
   ```

3. **Avoid All Major Blockers:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   ```

4. **Industrial Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [SIL, LSIS]  // Strategic/Locally Significant Industrial - may be released
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
   ```

5. **Flood Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3]  // Exclude high risk
   Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 2]  // Accept Zone 2 (mitigation possible)
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Use "Percentage of plot un-constrained" to find sites with minimal coverage (e.g., >80%)
- **Critical distinction:** "Built up areas" = urban context (GOOD), NOT a development blocker
- Green Belt = ~13% of England - major constraint but some brownfield exceptions exist
- Conservation Areas = ~2% of England - design restrictions, not necessarily a blocker
- Flood Zone 3 = high risk - insurance issues, planning refusal likely
- Flood Zone 2 = medium risk - mitigation measures required but achievable

**Related Filters:**
- Percentage of plot un-constrained (%) - Find sites with <20% constraint coverage
- Area of plot un-constrained (acres) - Absolute unconstrained area
- Percentage of title covered by Green Belt - Partial coverage may be workable
- Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2/3 - Assess flood risk extent

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Clean sites for quick planning
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80

# Policy-supported urban sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]

# Heritage-adjacent (not on-site)
Planning constraints: contains any [Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Near but not on
```

### Building Use Group

**Context:**
- High-level functional classification - 17 categories
- Less granular than "Use class" (planning), more functional than "Property type"
- Good for broad filtering before applying detailed "Use class" filters
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly listed as a category (unlike in Property type)

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (17 categories)
- **Commercial:** Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing, Commercial Activity: Other
- **Residential:** Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation
- **Public Services:** Education, Government Services, Medical or Emergency Services
- **Infrastructure:** Transport, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Construction
- **Other:** Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Attraction Sports or Activity, Religious Worship and Funeral Services, Mixed Use, Unknown

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other]
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection]
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // All residential types
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail]  // Retail focus
Building use group: does not contain [Unknown]  // Exclude unclear properties
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Building use group: 'Mixed Use' OR 'Commercial'
❌ Building use group: NOT 'Agriculture'
❌ Building use group: contains any [C3, E]  // WRONG - those are Use class values, not Building use group
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Broad Commercial Search:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]
   ```

2. **Exclude Non-Development Sites:**
   ```
   Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
   ```

3. **Mixed-Use Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
   // Then refine with specific Use class filters
   ```

4. **Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // Hotels to residential
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]  // Industrial to residential
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Good for initial broad filtering, then refine with "Use class"
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly tagged - useful for precedent-based searches
- "Unknown" category exists - may want to exclude or investigate separately
