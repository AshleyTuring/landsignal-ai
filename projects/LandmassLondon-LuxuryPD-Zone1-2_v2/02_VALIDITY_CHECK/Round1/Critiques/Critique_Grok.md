### Claude - Approach A: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and syntax is correct (numeric AND allowed, list-based operators proper). Units accurate (sqft, acres). Strategy aligns with PD route and liquidation motivation. Capital within £5M-£60M range. ROI achievable via PD speed and refurb. Viable execution with established Class MA precedent. Deal structure sound (freehold acquisition).

### Claude - Approach B: VALID
**Reasoning:** Filters exist with correct syntax and units (metres, dates). Strategy coherent with airspace potential and motivation signals. Capital fits budget. ROI realistic with airspace uplift. Viable with structural surveys and party wall agreements. Deal structure feasible (air rights negotiation).

### Claude - Approach C: VALID
**Reasoning:** Filters valid (PTAL list, metres, planning exclusions). Units correct. Strategy matches lease expiry motivation and retail conversion. Capital within range. ROI achievable with prime locations. Viable with planning or MA routes. Deal structure sound.

### Claude - Approach D: VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist with proper syntax and units. Strategy stacks multiple motivations logically. Capital appropriate. ROI strong with PD route. Viable execution. Deal structure viable.

### Claude - Approach E: CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** Filters exist and syntax correct (use class list, metres, acres). Units accurate. Strategy uses liquidation for Grey Belt, but planning is challenging with local opposition risk.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Grey Belt planning precedent exists but approval rates lower than urban sites

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add "Proposal: contains 'grey belt' OR 'previously developed'" to verify brownfield exception eligibility
- Include affordable housing contingency in capital model
