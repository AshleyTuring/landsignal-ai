## Strategy Overview

### Rationale
- **FORCED SALE:** Liquidation/administration = legal obligation to sell
- **Strong negotiating position:** Cash-ready buyer has significant leverage
- **Mixed-use derelict:** Clear redevelopment story for planning
- **Rail proximity:** Supports density/value arguments
- **Below-market pricing:** Distressed sellers = 20-40% discounts typical

### Target Property Profile
- **Ownership:** Company in liquidation or administration
- **Size:** 0.1-0.7 acres (4,356-30,492 sqft)
- **Current state:** Derelict building
- **Use:** Commercial (E class) or Mixed Use
- **Location:** Within 1.2km of train station
- **Market:** Listed for sale under £400k
- **Planning:** Minimal recent activity (<2 applications in 5 years)
- **Constraints:** No Conservation Area

## Capital Breakdown

| Item | Cost Range |
|------|------------|
| Option/deposit | £60k-£90k |
| Insolvency legal/due diligence | £15k-£25k |
| Surveys (structural/environmental/topographical) | £10k-£15k |

## Path to £2M Profit

**Strategy:** Acquire distressed asset at 30% discount, redevelop to 8-storey mixed-use

**Acquisition:**
- Listed price: £400k
- Distressed negotiation: £300k (25% discount)
- Below market value due to forced sale

**Development:**
- Current value (derelict): £300k
- Planning consent (8-storey mixed-use): £2.5M
- **Gross Development Value:** £2.5M

**Profit Calculation:**
- Acquisition: £300k
- Planning/options: £190k
- **Total invested:** £490k
- Sale with consent: £2.5M
- **Net profit:** £2.01M ✅

## Implementation Notes

### Strengths
- ✅ **Forced sale = maximum leverage** (liquidators must sell)
- ✅ Strong motivation signals (company distress + derelict building)
- ✅ Below-market entry pricing (20-40% typical discount)
- ✅ Cash buyer advantage in insolvency scenarios
- ✅ Clear redevelopment narrative (derelict → mixed-use)
- ✅ Rail proximity supports planning case

### Risks
- ⚠️ Insolvency timeline pressures (fast decision required)
- ⚠️ Derelict may have structural/contamination issues
- ⚠️ Liquidator may attract multiple bids
- ⚠️ Planning not guaranteed (derelict history may complicate)

### Mitigations
- Fast-track due diligence (structural survey within 2 weeks)
- Environmental indemnity negotiation with liquidator
- Pre-app planning consultation before offer
- Cash-ready position (proof of funds)
- Professional insolvency solicitor engagement

## Negotiation Strategy

### Key Advantages
1. **Legal obligation to sell** - liquidator has fiduciary duty
2. **Cash buyer** - no financing contingency
3. **Fast completion** - 4-6 weeks vs 3-6 months typical
4. **As-is purchase** - limited negotiations on condition

### Negotiation Tactics
1. Proof of funds letter upfront
2. Structural survey within 7-10 days
3. Offer 25-35% below asking (liquidators expect discount)
4. Short exclusivity period (14 days)
5. Completion within 28 days
