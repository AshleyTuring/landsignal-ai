## Strategy Overview

### Rationale
- **Low capital entry:** Option agreements (£30k fee) vs £500k+ purchase
- **Long ownership:** Pre-2015 sales = 10+ years held = motivated sellers
- **Off-market:** No listing = less competition, better pricing
- **Transport accessibility:** <800m stations supports high-density planning
- **Low height:** <12m existing = clear intensification potential
- **Large plots:** 0.25-1.5 acres = significant development upside

### Target Property Profile
- **Height:** <12m (3-4 storeys existing)
- **Location:** Within 800m of train station
- **Size:** 0.25-1.5 acres (10,890-65,340 sqft)
- **Use:** E (commercial) or Sui Generis
- **Ownership:** Last sold before 2015 (10+ years held)
- **Planning:** <2 applications in 5 years (passive ownership)
- **Market:** Not currently listed (off-market)
- **Constraints:** No Green Belt

## Capital Breakdown

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Option fee (1-3% land value) | £30,000 |
| Legal fees (option agreement) | £10,000 |
| Initial planning/architectural reports | £25,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **£65,000** |

**Why So Low:**
- No property purchase (just option rights)
- No stamp duty (not a sale)
- No maintenance/holding costs during option period
- Fixed costs regardless of property value

---

## Path to £2M Profit

**Strategy:** Option 3 sites at £30k each, secure planning, sell with consent

**Site 1:**
- Current value: £800k
- Option fee: £30k (3.75%)
- Planning costs: £40k
- Post-consent value: £2.5M
- **Profit:** £1.5M

**Site 2:**
- Current value: £700k
- Option fee: £30k
- Planning costs: £40k
- Post-consent value: £2.2M
- **Profit:** £1.3M

**Site 3:**
- Current value: £600k
- Option fee: £25k
- Planning costs: £35k
- Post-consent value: £1.9M
- **Profit:** £1.1M

**Total Portfolio:**
- 3 sites optioned: £85k + £115k planning = £200k total
- 2 of 3 succeed: **£2.8M profit** ✅
- Conservative: 1 large site: **£1.5M profit** (still achieves £2M if done twice)

## Implementation Notes

### Strengths
- ✅ **Minimal capital exposure** (£65k vs £500k+ purchase)
- ✅ Off-market = less competition
- ✅ 10+ year ownership = motivated sellers (equity release, estate planning)
- ✅ Low height = clear intensification story
- ✅ Rail proximity = planning policy support
- ✅ Option period = time to secure planning without ownership risk

### Risks
- ⚠️ Option negotiations require skill
- ⚠️ Seller may not understand option agreements
- ⚠️ Planning not guaranteed
- ⚠️ Option period limited (typically 12-24 months)

### Mitigations
- Professional option agreement solicitor
- Clear seller education (explain benefits: no estate agent fees, guaranteed buyer)
- Pre-app planning consultation before option exercise
- Structure option with extension rights (option to extend 12 months)

## Motivation Scoring Index (MSI)

**Expected MSI:** 7-9 (Very High)

| Factor | Points | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Base Score | 3 | Baseline |
| Ownership >10 years | +2 | 10+ years held (tired landlord) |
| Not on market | +1 | Passive, not actively selling |
| Low planning activity | +1 | Not developed recently |
| Off-market approach | +1 | Less pressure, can negotiate |
| **TOTAL MSI** | **8** | **Very high motivation** |

**Why High:**
- 10+ year ownership = tired of managing
- Not listed = not desperate, but often receptive to direct approach
- Equity release motivation (retirement, estate planning)

---

## Option Agreement Strategy

### Key Terms to Negotiate
1. **Option fee:** 1-3% of current value (£20k-£40k typical)
2. **Option period:** 18-24 months (with 12-month extension clause)
3. **Purchase price:** Fixed at current value + inflation index
4. **Exclusivity:** Seller cannot market/sell during option period
5. **Planning risk:** Seller has no obligations during planning process

### Seller Benefits (Pitch)
- No estate agent fees (3-5% saved)
- Guaranteed buyer if planning secured
- No ongoing marketing hassle
- Upfront option fee (non-refundable income)
- Price agreed now (inflation protection)

### Your Benefits
- Control property without purchase
- Time to secure planning
- No holding costs/maintenance
- Walk away if planning rejected (lose option fee only)
- Sell option rights if planning secured (don't have to complete purchase)

---

## Expected Results

**Initial Search:** 10-30 properties  
**After Visual Screening:** 8-20 viable sites  
**After Owner Research:** 5-12 contactable owners  
**Final Options Secured:** 2-3 sites  

**Note:** Off-market = more work to identify owners, but higher success rate once contacted.

## Next Steps (Stage 4)

1. **Execute search in SearchLand.co.uk**
2. **Capture screenshot of AI interpretation**
3. **Validate filter parsing**
4. **Document results** by geography
5. **Land Registry title lookup** (identify owners - £3-£7 per property)
6. **Owner research** (Companies House, social media, property history)
7. **Direct approach letters** (professional, personalized)
8. **Multi-LLM analysis** of shortlisted properties
9. **Option negotiations** with responsive owners

## Direct Approach Letter Template

**Subject:** Confidential Property Opportunity - [Property Address]

Dear [Owner Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you directly regarding your property at [Address], which I have identified as having significant development potential.

I am a private property developer looking to secure option agreements on well-located commercial properties near train stations. I am prepared to offer:

- **Upfront option fee:** £[X],000 (non-refundable)
- **Option period:** 18-24 months (no obligations on your part)
- **Agreed purchase price:** £[Current Value] + RPI
- **No estate agent fees:** Direct transaction (saving you 3-5%)

This is not a standard purchase offer - you retain ownership while I secure planning permission. If I succeed, you benefit from the agreed sale price. If not, you keep the option fee with no downside.

Would you be open to a confidential conversation to explore this further?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
