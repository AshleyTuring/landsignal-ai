## Strategy Overview

### Rationale
- **PDR = No planning needed:** Class MA allows industrial → residential conversion
- **Value uplift:** Industrial £100-£150/sqft → Residential £300-£500/sqft (2-3x)
- **Existing structure:** Lower capex than ground-up build
- **SearchLand calculates profit:** Built-in viability check
- **1,500 sqm limit** (16,145 sqft) = perfect for Class MA eligibility

### Target Property Profile
- **Use:** B1c (light industrial), B2 (general industrial), or E(g)(iii) (industrial processes)
- **Size:** 5,000-50,000 sqft (465-4,645 sqm)
- **Site area:** <0.988 acres (43,004 sqft) for Class MA compliance
- **Condition:** Active building (not derelict/inactive)
- **Location:** Within 1.2km of train station
- **Planning:** <2 applications in 5 years (not over-developed)
- **Tenure:** Freehold only
- **Constraints:** No flood zones, AONB, Conservation, SSSI

## Capital Breakdown

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Option fees (6 buildings × £15k) | £90k |
| Conversion costs (internal fit-out) | £200k |
| Legal/professional | £20k |
| **TOTAL** | **~£310k** |

**Financing Options:**
- Phase capital: Options first (£90k), then conversions
- JV with builder: They fund £200k conversions, profit share
- Bridge finance: Use industrial value as security

---

## Path to £2M Profit

**Strategy:** Option 6 industrial buildings, convert to residential under Class MA PDR

**Building 1 Example:**
- Current value (industrial): £1.8M
- Conversion costs: £200k (internal fit-out only)
- Post-conversion value (residential): £3.5M
- **Profit:** £1.67M

**Portfolio Approach:**
- 6 buildings optioned @ £15k each = £90k
- 4 successful conversions × £1M average profit = **£4M total**
- **Conservative (3 of 6 succeed):** £3M profit ✅

**Why High Profit:**
- No planning permission needed (PDR)
- Existing structure = lower costs
- Industrial → residential = 2-3x value uplift
- Train proximity = premium residential pricing

---

## Implementation Notes

### Strengths
- ✅ **No planning permission needed** (Class MA PDR)
- ✅ Massive value uplift (2-3x industrial pricing)
- ✅ Existing structure = lower capex vs ground-up
- ✅ Active buildings = no remediation costs
- ✅ Freehold only = clean ownership
- ✅ Option strategy limits capital exposure

### Risks
- ⚠️ Class MA eligibility strict (must verify 1,500 sqm limit)
- ⚠️ Building Code compliance required (fire safety, insulation)
- ⚠️ Industrial neighbors may object (though PDR approved in principle)
- ⚠️ Market risk if residential demand softens

### Mitigations
- Verify Class MA eligibility before option exercise
- Structural engineer assessment pre-option
- Review local housing demand (ONS data, Rightmove trends)
- Target buildings already in mixed-use areas (less neighbor objection)

## Class MA PDR Requirements (Critical)

**Eligibility Criteria:**
1. ✅ Building size: ≤1,500 sqm (16,145 sqft)
2. ✅ Use: B1c, B2, or E(g)(iii) (industrial processes)
3. ✅ No Article 4 direction in area
4. ✅ Built before 2014 (most industrial buildings qualify)
5. ✅ No structural alterations to external walls/roof
6. ✅ Freehold or leasehold with 7+ years remaining

**What You CAN Do:**
- Internal fit-out (walls, kitchens, bathrooms)
- Fire safety upgrades
- Insulation/energy efficiency
- Windows/doors replacement (like-for-like)

**What You CAN'T Do:**
- Extend building footprint
- Change roof profile
- Alter external walls
- Add extra storeys

## Motivation Scoring Index (MSI)

**Expected MSI:** 4-6 (Moderate)

| Factor | Points | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Base Score | 3 | Baseline |
| Low planning activity | +1 | Passive ownership |
| Freehold | +1 | Full ownership control |
| **TOTAL MSI** | **5** | **Moderate motivation** |

**Note:** MSI lower than distressed approaches, but PDR removes planning risk (compensates).

## Expected Results

**Initial Search:** 10-30 properties  
**After Visual Screening:** 8-20 viable buildings  
**After Eligibility Check:** 5-12 Class MA compliant  
**Final Options:** 4-6 buildings

## Next Steps (Stage 4)

1. **Execute search in SearchLand.co.uk**
2. **Capture screenshot of AI interpretation**
3. **Validate filter parsing**
4. **Document results** by geography
5. **Visual screening** (verify industrial use, building condition)
6. **Class MA eligibility check** (verify <1,500 sqm, no Article 4)
7. **Multi-LLM analysis** of top 10 properties
8. **Structural engineer walk-through** on top 3-4 targets
9. **Option negotiations** (target 3-6 month exclusivity)
