## Strategy Overview

### Rationale
- **Hard capital cap:** Direct purchase within £200k budget (no leverage needed)
- **Inactivity = motivation:** Stronger negotiation leverage
- **Rail proximity:** Exit value/marketability driver
- **Low coverage (<40%):** Buildable slack for intensification
- **Minimal planning history:** Passive ownership, easy to approach

### Target Property Profile
- **Price:** Under £200k (listed for sale)
- **Tenure:** Freehold only
- **Size:** 0.05-0.3 acres (2,178-13,068 sqft)
- **Current state:** Inactive building
- **Use:** Commercial (E class) or Mixed Use
- **Location:** Within 1km of train station
- **Coverage:** <40% developed (60%+ buildable space)
- **Planning:** <1 application in 5 years (passive)
- **Constraints:** No flood zones

## Capital Breakdown

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Acquisition | £120k-£150k |
| Legals/surveys/valuation | £10k-£15k |
| Planning/architect/daylight | £10k-£15k |
| Contingency/holding | £15k-£25k |
| **TOTAL** | **~£200k** |

---

## Path to £2M Profit

**Strategy:** Portfolio approach - acquire 10-15 properties, each with £150k-£200k profit potential

**Single Property Example:**
- Acquisition: £150k
- Planning/holding: £50k
- Current value: £150k
- With consent (small residential extension): £500k
- **Profit per property:** £200k

**Portfolio Math:**
- 10 properties × £200k average profit = **£2M total**
- 15 properties × £150k average profit = **£2.25M total**
- **Conservative:** 12 properties @ £170k avg = **£2.04M**

**Exit Strategy:**
- Sell with planning consent to small builders
- Or JV with builder (reduce capital, share profit)
- Or phase development (3-4 at a time)

## Implementation Notes

### Strengths
- ✅ **Zero leverage risk** (all cash purchase)
- ✅ Inactive buildings = motivated sellers
- ✅ Low coverage = development upside clear
- ✅ Rail proximity = marketability to end buyers
- ✅ Portfolio diversification (10-15 assets)
- ✅ Freehold only = clean ownership

### Risks
- ⚠️ Volume required (need 10-15 acquisitions for £2M)
- ⚠️ Time-intensive (negotiate 10+ deals)
- ⚠️ Planning not guaranteed on all sites
- ⚠️ Market dependent (need buyers for consented sites)

### Mitigations
- Systematic approach (standard offer template)
- Professional buyer's agent for volume sourcing
- Pre-app planning consultation before purchase
- Staged purchases (3-4 per quarter)
- Build relationships with local small builders (pre-sell)

## Motivation Scoring Index (MSI)

**Expected MSI:** 6-8 (High)

| Factor | Points | Evidence |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Base Score | 3 | Baseline |
| Inactive building | +2 | Not generating income |
| Sub-£200k pricing | +1 | Below typical commercial value |
| Low planning activity | +1 | Passive ownership |
| Listed for sale | +1 | Active motivation |
| **TOTAL MSI** | **8** | **High motivation** |

---

## Expected Results

**Initial Search:** 15-40 properties  
**After Visual Screening:** 10-25 viable sites  
**After Due Diligence:** 8-15 acquisition targets  
**Final Purchases:** 10-12 properties

## Negotiation Strategy

### Key Advantages
1. **Cash buyer** - no financing contingency
2. **Fast completion** - 2-4 weeks vs months
3. **As-is purchase** - limit survey-based renegotiation
4. **Volume buyer** - build relationships with agents

### Offer Strategy
- Initial offer: 10-15% below asking
- Survey-based adjustment: 5-10% if issues found
- Target completion: 28 days
- No onerous conditions
