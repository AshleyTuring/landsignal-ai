## SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
1. Proposal: contains "Approved" OR contains "Permission Granted"
2. Proposal: contains "Mixed Use" OR contains "mixed-use" OR contains "Retail and Residential"
3. Proposal: contains "storey" OR contains "storeys"
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 18
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.6
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. PTAL: is one of 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Green Belt]
9. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 3
10. Building on title is inactive: Yes OR Building on title is derelict: Yes
```

**⚠️ SYNTAX NOTE:** SearchLand doesn't have "Planning Status" or "Development Type" filters. I've corrected to use "Proposal" text search instead.

## Strategy Overview

### Rationale
- **Direct precedent match:** Targets approved 6-8 storey mixed-use schemes
- **Transport accessibility:** PTAL 3+ or <800m stations supports density
- **Motivation signals:** Inactive/derelict buildings = stalled projects
- **Constraint avoidance:** Excludes Conservation, Listed, Green Belt blockers

### Target Property Profile
- **Size:** 0.1-0.6 acres (4,356-26,136 sqft)
- **Current state:** Inactive or derelict building
- **Location:** High transport accessibility (PTAL 3+)
- **Planning:** Recent approved precedent for 6-8 storey mixed-use
- **Constraints:** Clean (no Conservation, Listed, Green Belt)

## Capital Breakdown

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Option fees (3 sites) | £60,000 |
| Due diligence + legal | £30,500 |
| Planning refresh (if needed) | £40,000 |
| Holding + contingency | £28,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **£158,500** |

## Path to £2M Profit

**Strategy:** Secure options on 3 high-potential sites, replicate proven precedent

**Site 1:**
- Current value: £800k
- Consented value (8-storey mixed-use): £2.5M
- **Profit:** £1.6M

**Site 2:**
- Current value: £600k
- Consented value (6-7 storey mixed-use): £2.0M
- **Profit:** £1.3M

**Site 3:**
- Current value: £500k
- Consented value (6 storey mixed-use): £1.8M
- **Profit:** £1.2M

**Total Potential:** £4.1M across 3 sites  
**Conservative Scenario:** 2 of 3 succeed = **£2.9M profit**  
**Target Met:** ✅ Exceeds £2M profit target

## Implementation Notes

### Strengths
- ✅ Direct precedent replication reduces planning risk
- ✅ High transport accessibility supports density argument
- ✅ Inactive/derelict signals motivated sellers
- ✅ Option strategy limits capital exposure
- ✅ Multiple sites diversify risk

### Risks
- ⚠️ Planning approval not guaranteed (precedent helps but not binding)
- ⚠️ PTAL filter London-only (needs geography adjustment for UK-wide)
- ⚠️ Inactive filter may be too restrictive (consider removing if low results)
- ⚠️ Option negotiations require skill

### Mitigations
- Pre-app consultation before option exercise
- Replicate exact precedent parameters (storey count, use mix, massing)
- Target same planning authority as precedent
- Professional planning consultant engagement

## Expected Results

**Initial Search:** 15-30 properties  
**After Visual Screening:** 8-15 viable sites  
**After Due Diligence:** 3-5 option targets  
**Final Options Secured:** 2-3 sites

## Next Steps (Stage 4)

1. **Execute search in SearchLand.co.uk**
2. **Capture screenshot of AI interpretation**
3. **Validate filter parsing** (ensure all 10 filters created correctly)
4. **Document results** by geography
5. **Visual screening** of property satellite images
6. **Multi-LLM analysis** of shortlisted properties (Stage 5)
7. **Deep research** on top 3 targets (Stage 6)
