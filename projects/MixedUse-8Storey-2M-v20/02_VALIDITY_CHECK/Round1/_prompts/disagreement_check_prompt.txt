# Disagreement Detection Task

Analyze the 4 critique files and identify TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS CASE DISAGREEMENTS.

## What Counts as Disagreement
- LLM A says filter exists, LLM B says it doesn't (factual dispute)
- LLM A says "acres", LLM B says "sqft" for same filter (unit dispute)
- LLM A says VALID syntax, LLM B says INVALID syntax (technical dispute)
- LLM A says £n is sufficient, LLM B says it's not (capital feasibility dispute)
- LLM A says ROI achievable, LLM B says unrealistic (business case dispute)
- LLM A says deal structure works, LLM B says legally/financially flawed (implementation dispute)

## What Does NOT Count
- Priority rankings (A ranks #1, B ranks #3 - both valid)
- Strategic preferences (speed vs certainty - philosophical)
- Implementation styles (different but both correct)

## Special Note on Precedent-Based Approaches
For approaches replicating user-provided planning applications:
- Business case is AUTO-VALID (user requested it)
- Focus validation on: Do filters actually replicate the precedent correctly?
- Multiple valid filter implementations are expected and acceptable

## Output Format
If disagreements exist:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** [Filter existence | Units | Syntax | Capital feasibility | ROI | Deal structure]
**Approaches:** [Which approaches affected]
**Positions:**
- LLM A: [Position]
- LLM B: [Position]
- LLM C: [Position]
- LLM D: [Position]

**Impact:** [Critical | Minor]
**Requires iteration:** [YES | NO]

---

If no disagreements:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: NO

All LLMs agree on technical and business case facts. Strategic differences are preserved.


## CRITIQUES TO ANALYZE

### Critique_Claude

I can proceed with the validation using the comprehensive filter documentation provided in the reference materials. Let me analyze each approach systematically.

---

# Technical & Business Case Validation Report

## Validation Methodology

I've reviewed all 10 approaches across 4 LLMs (Claude: 5 approaches, Codex: 3, Gemini: 2, Grok: 2) against the following criteria:
1. **Filter Existence** - Do all filters exist in SearchLand?
2. **Syntax Validity** - Is the SearchLand AI syntax correct?
3. **Unit Accuracy** - Are units correct (acres vs sqft, metres)?
4. **Logical Coherence** - Do filters match the stated strategy?
5. **Capital Feasibility** - Does the approach meet the £200k budget?
6. **ROI Calculations** - Is £2M profit achievable?
7. **Implementation Viability** - Can this be executed as described?

## CLAUDE APPROACHES (5 Total)

### Claude - Approach A: High-Density Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Reasoning:** Strong strategic approach with mostly valid filters, but contains critical syntax errors and one non-existent filter that would cause search failure.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **❌ CRITICAL SYNTAX ERROR - Line 1:**
   ```
   ❌ Planning Status: contains "Approved" OR "Permission Granted"
   ```
   - **Problem:** "Planning Status" filter does NOT exist in SearchLand
   - **Additionally:** Invalid OR syntax (should use list-based operator)
   - **Impact:** Search will fail completely

2. **❌ SYNTAX ERROR - Line 2:**
   ```
   ❌ Development Type: contains "Mixed Use" OR "Retail and Residential"
   ```
   - **Problem:** "Development Type" filter does NOT exist in SearchLand
   - **Available alternative:** "Building use group" or "Property classification"

3. **❌ SYNTAX ERROR - Line 3:**
   ```
   ❌ Planning Description: contains "storey" OR "storeys"
   ```
   - **Problem:** "Planning Description" does NOT exist
   - **Correct filter:** "Proposal: contains 'storey'"

4. **⚠️ UNIT MISMATCH - Line 5:**
   ```
   Site Area: >= 0.1 acres ✓ Correct unit
   ```
   - Actually correct (acres is valid)

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ CORRECTED VERSION:
1. Proposal: contains "mixed" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR contains "residential"
3. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 18 AND less than 30
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]
7. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
8. Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough  // IF this filter exists
```

**Alternative Approach (if no "Local Planning Authority" filter):**
- Remove LPA filter
- Use geographic bounding box or manual post-filtering
- Add: `PTAL: contains any [3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b]` if London-adjacent areas

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £180k budget is realistic for this strategy

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £2M-£4M profit is achievable with 8-storey mixed-use precedent

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent precedent-based strategy (meets mandatory requirement)
- Strong logic: replicate proven Slough approval
- Implementation plan is solid once filters corrected

---

### Claude - Approach B: Article 4 Direction Expiry - Office to Resi
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Reasoning:** Innovative regulation-driven strategy, but relies on filter that may not exist and has implementation timing challenges.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **❌ FILTER EXISTENCE - Article 4 Expiry:**
   ```
   Problem: No "Article 4 expiry date" or "Article 4 status: expiring" filter documented
   Available: "Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions" (% coverage only)
   ```
   - Cannot directly filter for expiring Article 4 directions
   - Would need external research (council websites) + manual targeting

2. **❌ MISSING IMPLEMENTATION DETAIL:**
   - Article 4 expiry dates vary by council and are NOT in SearchLand data
   - Requires separate research per Local Planning Authority
   - Strategy is valid but cannot be executed via SearchLand filters alone

3. **⚠️ TIMING RISK:**
   - Article 4 directions are often renewed/extended
   - No guarantee restrictions will actually lift
   - Expiry ≠ automatic reinstatement of PDR

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ MODIFIED APPROACH - Target Article 4 Areas for Future Research:
1. Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is greater than 0
2. Use class: contains any [E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)]  // Office classes
3. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]

THEN: Manual research of Article 4 expiry dates per council
```

**Alternative Strategy:**
- Target areas where Article 4 does NOT apply (inverse strategy)
- Immediate PDR opportunities rather than waiting for expiry

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £200k is adequate for option + conversion costs

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £2.8M is achievable IF Article 4 lifts as expected  
⚠️ **However:** High execution risk due to manual research required

**Strategic Notes:**
- Brilliant strategic thinking (regulation-driven arbitrage)
- **Fatal flaw:** Cannot be executed via SearchLand filters alone
- Requires hybrid approach: SearchLand + council policy research
- Consider pivoting to immediate PDR opportunities (no Article 4) instead

---

### Claude - Approach C: Stalled Planning + Fresh Option Arbitrage
**Status:** ✅ **VALID** (with minor syntax corrections)

**Reasoning:** Solid time-arbitrage strategy with mostly correct filters. Minor syntax issues but core logic is sound.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **⚠️ SYNTAX INCONSISTENCY - Date Format:**
   ```
   Current: Last application submitted: between 2022-01-01 AND 2023-12-31
   Better: Last application submitted: is between 2022-01-01 and 2023-12-31
   ```
   - Minor - SearchLand AI will likely parse correctly

2. **⚠️ LOGIC REFINEMENT:**
   ```
   Current: Max number of dwellings applied for: >= 5
   Suggestion: >= 8 (to match 8-storey precedent scale)
   ```

3. **✅ ALL FILTERS EXIST:**
   - Proposal ✓
   - Last application submitted ✓
   - Max number of dwellings applied for ✓
   - Building on title is inactive ✓
   - Title area (acres) ✓
   - Distance to nearest Train Station (m) ✓
   - Flood Zone 3 ✓

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ REFINED VERSION:
1. Proposal: contains "residential"
2. Last application submitted: is between 2022-01-01 and 2023-12-31
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 8
4. Building on title is inactive: Yes
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £190k budget is realistic

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £2.17M is achievable - stalled planning reduces risk

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Excellent approach** - targets derisked opportunities
- Strong motivation signal (inactive + stalled planning)
- Time arbitrage is proven strategy
- Minimal corrections needed

---

### Claude - Approach D: Permitted Development - Light Industrial to Resi
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Reasoning:** Technically sound PDR strategy with correct filters and realistic financial modeling.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **✅ SYNTAX CHECK - Use Class:**
   ```
   Current approach describes B1c/B2 but doesn't show exact filter syntax
   Should be: Use class: contains any [B2 - General industrial, E(g)(iii) - Industrial processes]
   ```
   - Note: B1c was abolished in 2020, now part of E(g)(iii)

2. **⚠️ PDR ELIGIBILITY - Minor Correction:**
   - Class MA (office to resi) is most common PDR
   - Light industrial (B1c) → Residential was previously Class PA
   - **Current status:** Most B class → Resi requires full planning (not PDR)
   - **Exception:** Some B1c converted to E(g)(iii) may qualify for E → Resi PDR

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ CORRECTED FOR CLASS MA (Office to Resi PDR):
1. Use class: contains any [E(g)(i) - Offices, E(g)(ii) - Research and development]
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 5000 AND less than 100000
3. Title area (acres): is less than 0.988  // 4,000 sqmt limit
4. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area, National Landscapes (AONB)]
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200
6. Article 4: No  // Ensure PDR not restricted
```

**OR - If Targeting True Industrial (Requires Full Planning):**
```
1. Use class: contains any [B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 10000
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
4. Building on title is inactive: Yes
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, Green Belt]
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £200k adequate for options + PDR fees

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £3M-£4M achievable BUT depends on PDR vs full planning  
- ⚠️ If Class MA (office): £1M-£2M per building realistic
- ⚠️ If B2 industrial: Requires full planning, higher risk

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Core strategy is excellent**
- **Key issue:** B1c/B2 → Resi is NOT standard PDR anymore
- Recommend pivoting to Class MA (E(g)(i) offices) for true PDR path
- Or acknowledge full planning required and adjust timeline/risk

---

### Claude - Approach E: Green Belt Exception Sites - Community-Led Housing
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Reasoning:** Innovative community partnership strategy, but extremely complex to execute and relies on policy interpretation rather than straightforward filters.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **✅ FILTERS EXIST - Basic Search:**
   ```
   ✓ Planning constraints: contains any [Green Belt]
   ✓ Title area (acres): is greater than 2 AND less than 10
   ✓ Use class: contains any [Agriculture]
   ✓ Distance to nearest settlement boundary (m): is less than 500
   ```

2. **❌ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLEXITY - Not Filter Issue:**
   - "Exception site policy" is not a SearchLand filter
   - Requires manual identification of:
     - Local housing needs surveys
     - Parish council support
     - Housing Association partnerships
     - Local plan exception site policies
   - **SearchLand can find land, but cannot identify community need**

3. **⚠️ CAPITAL vs TIMELINE MISMATCH:**
   - £200k budget ✓
   - BUT: Community-led projects take 3-5+ years
   - Housing Association partnerships take 12-24 months to structure
   - Profit realization timeline >> 2-3 years typical for other approaches

4. **⚠️ PROFIT STRUCTURE COMPLEXITY:**
   - Cross-subsidy model: Affordable units (80%) + Market units (20%)
   - Profit from market units only
   - Requires Section 106 negotiation
   - Financial modeling highly variable by scheme

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ SIMPLIFIED GREEN BELT SEARCH (For Manual Exception Site Research):
1. Planning constraints: contains any [Green Belt]
2. Planning constraints: contains any [Built up areas]  // Edge of settlement
3. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: is greater than 80
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 2 AND less than 10
5. Use class: contains any [Agriculture Or Aquaculture]  // Using Building use group
6. Distance to nearest built up area (m): is less than 100
7. Sales listing currently on the market: No  // Off-market

THEN: Manual research per site:
- Review local plan for exception site policy
- Engage parish council for housing needs survey
- Approach Housing Associations (Homes England, Clarion, etc.)
- Confirm community support before optioning land
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £200k adequate for agricultural land options

**ROI Potential:** ⚠️ **UNCERTAIN**  
- £2.27M is theoretically achievable
- **BUT:** Highly dependent on:
  - Community support (not guaranteed)
  - Housing Association terms (they capture most value)
  - Section 106 negotiation (LA may demand 100% affordable)
  - 5+ year timeline (opportunity cost)

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Most innovative approach** but also highest execution complexity
- Not really a "SearchLand strategy" - more of a land promotion strategy
- Requires expertise in community engagement + Housing Association deals
- Better suited for experienced land promoters, not £200k opportunistic investor
- **Recommend:** Deprioritize unless you have existing HA relationships

## CODEX APPROACHES (3 Total)

### Codex - Approach A: Slough 8-Storey Precedent Match
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Reasoning:** Strong precedent strategy but contains non-existent filter and minor syntax issues.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **❌ FILTER DOES NOT EXIST - Line 1:**
   ```
   ❌ Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough
   ```
   - "Local Planning Authority" is NOT a documented SearchLand filter
   - **Impact:** Cannot filter directly to Slough in SearchLand
   - **Workaround:** Use geographic bounding box or post-filter manually

2. **❌ INVALID OPERATOR - Line 2:**
   ```
   ❌ Decision: is one of Approved
   ```
   - "Decision" filter is not documented
   - Should use: "Proposal: contains 'approved'" (in description text)
   - Or rely on date filters for recent approvals

3. **⚠️ COMPOUND OR LOGIC - Lines 3-5:**
   ```
   Current:
   3. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
   4. Proposal: contains "retail"
   5. Proposal: contains "residential"
   
   Problem: These are THREE separate filters (implicit AND between them)
   SearchLand will require ALL three keywords present
   ```
   - Should be: `Proposal: contains "mixed use" AND ("retail" OR "residential")`
   - **However:** SearchLand may not support nested OR within Proposal field

4. **✅ OTHER FILTERS VALID:**
   - Max building height (m) ✓
   - Distance to nearest Train Station (m) ✓
   - Title area (acres) ✓
   - Conservation area ✓
   - Applications in last 5 years ✓

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ CORRECTED VERSION (Without LPA Filter):
1. Proposal: contains "mixed" AND "storey" AND "retail"
2. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 18 AND less than 30
3. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
7. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]

THEN: Manually filter results to Slough area using:
- Title address: contains "Slough"
- Or export and filter by postcode (SL1, SL2, SL3)
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £180k budget realistic

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £1.5M-£3M achievable with Slough precedent

**Strategic Notes:**
- Identical strategy to Claude Approach A (good - validates approach)
- Same filter issues (non-existent filters)
- Once corrected, this is a strong precedent-based strategy
- Recommendation: Use corrected filters above

---

### Codex - Approach B: Sub-£200k Mixed-Use Footfall Edge
**Status:** ✅ **VALID** (with minor syntax correction)

**Reasoning:** Solid low-capital entry strategy with mostly correct filters and realistic financial modeling.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **⚠️ SYNTAX - Use Class Filter (Line 4):**
   ```
   Current: Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"
   
   Problem: Invalid OR syntax
   Should be: Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]
   ```
   - "Mixed" is not a Use class value (Mixed Use is a "Building use group")
   - Correct approach: Combine Use class + Building use group filters

2. **✅ ALL OTHER FILTERS EXIST:**
   - Sales listing price ✓
   - Sales listing currently on the market ✓
   - Tenure ✓
   - Building on title is inactive ✓
   - Distance to nearest Train Station (m) ✓
   - Title area (acres) ✓
   - Developed area percentage ✓
   - Flood Zone 2/3 ✓
   - Applications in last 5 years ✓

3. **⚠️ LOGICAL REFINEMENT:**
   - "Developed area percentage: < 40" is good
   - Consider also: "Undeveloped area (acres): > 0.05" for explicit slack

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ CORRECTED VERSION:
1. Sales listing price: is less than 200000
2. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]
5. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other]
6. Building on title is inactive: Yes
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
9. Developed area percentage: is less than 40
10. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3]
11. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ Exactly £200k budget (acquisition-focused)

**ROI Potential:** ✅ Achievable but scale-dependent  
- £150k purchase + £50k planning → £400k-£600k sale with consent = £200k-£400k profit per site
- Need 5-10 sites to reach £2M target
- **Challenge:** Finding multiple <£200k opportunities in transport-accessible locations

**Strategic Notes:**
- Most capital-efficient approach (direct purchase, no options)
- Strong motivation signals (inactive + on-market)
- **Risk:** Limited inventory at <£200k price point in desirable areas
- Best suited for: Smaller towns, edge-of-urban locations
- Diversification required (10+ targets to hit 2-3 successes)

---

### Codex - Approach C: Distressed Company Mixed-Use Sites Near Stations
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Reasoning:** Excellent motivation-driven strategy with all filters correct and strong financial logic.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **✅ ALL FILTERS EXIST AND CORRECT:**
   ```
   ✓ Ownership type: is equal to Company
   ✓ Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
   ✓ Use class: contains any [E, Mixed]  // Should refine "Mixed"
   ✓ Building on title is derelict: Yes
   ✓ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200
   ✓ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.7
   ✓ Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
   ✓ Sales listing price: is less than 400000
   ✓ Applications in last 5 years: is less than 2
   ✓ Conservation area: is not within  // Should use Planning constraints filter
   ```

2. **⚠️ MINOR SYNTAX REFINEMENT:**
   ```
   Current: Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"
   Better: Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]
   AND: Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
   ```

3. **⚠️ CONSERVATION AREA FILTER:**
   ```
   Current: Conservation area: is not within
   Correct filter name: Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]
   ```

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ REFINED VERSION:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]
4. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other]
5. Building on title is derelict: Yes
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.7
8. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
9. Sales listing price: is less than 400000
10. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
11. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £190k budget realistic (deposit + due diligence focused)

**ROI Potential:** ✅ **EXCELLENT** - Distressed sales offer 20-40% discounts  
- £300k distressed purchase → £800k with planning = £500k profit
- 4-5 successful sites = £2M+ total profit
- **Key advantage:** Forced seller motivation (strongest signal)

**Strategic Notes:**
- **BEST motivation-driven approach across all LLMs**
- Leverages SearchLand's unique "Company status" filter (discovered in learnings)
- Combines multiple motivation signals:
  - Liquidation/Administration (forced sale) ✓
  - Derelict building (asset write-down) ✓
  - On-market (active sale) ✓
- **Implementation reality:** Very small pool (5-20 properties)
  - Must run search frequently (weekly) to catch new liquidations
  - Fast action required (days, not weeks)
- **Risk:** Due diligence complexity (charges, warranties, structural issues)
- **Overall:** High-conviction strategy, minimal corrections needed

## GEMINI APPROACHES (2 Total)

### Gemini - Approach A: High-Density Intensification via Option Agreement
**Status:** ✅ **VALID** (Minor optimization possible)

**Reasoning:** Technically sound precedent-based strategy with correct filters and realistic option agreement structure.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **✅ ALL FILTERS EXIST:**
   ```
   ✓ Max building height on title (m)
   ✓ Distance to nearest Train Station (m)
   ✓ Title area (acres)
   ✓ Use class
   ✓ Latest sold date
   ✓ Applications in the last 5 years
   ✓ Sales listing currently on the market
   ✓ Percentage of title covered by Green Belt
   ```

2. **✅ SYNTAX CORRECT:**
   ```
   ✓ Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
   ✓ Use class: is one of [E, Sui Generis]
   ✓ Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
   ✓ Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
   ✓ Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: is equal to 0
   ```

3. **⚠️ MINOR OPTIMIZATION - Use Class:**
   ```
   Current: Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"
   
   Note: Correct but can be more specific for commercial buildings:
   Better: Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]
   ```
   - Syntax is valid either way

4. **⚠️ LOGICAL CONSIDERATION:**
   - "Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2" = 0 or 1 applications
   - Good for long-hold owners
   - May exclude sites with recent refused applications (could be motivated sellers)
   - Consider: "is less than 3" for slightly broader net

**Suggested Optimization (Optional):**

```
✅ OPTIMIZED VERSION:
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]
5. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3  // Slightly broader
7. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
8. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: is equal to 0
9. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes  // Add motivation signal
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £65k budget is conservative and realistic  
- Option fees: £30k (multiple sites)
- Legal: £10k
- Planning prep: £25k
- **Strength:** Low initial capital, high leverage

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £2M+ achievable with 8-storey intensification  
- Option at £500k → Planning consent for £2M → Net profit £1.5M per site
- 2 successful sites = £3M profit
- Option structure limits downside risk

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Cleanest technical implementation** across all precedent approaches
- No non-existent filters (unlike Claude/Codex Approach A)
- Strong motivation signals (old ownership + no marketing + low activity)
- Option agreement structure is well-explained
- **Recommendation:** This is the technically superior precedent-based approach
- **Minor improvement:** Add "Building on title is inactive" for stronger motivation

### Gemini - Approach B: Opportunistic Liquidation Acquisition
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Reasoning:** Identical core strategy to Codex Approach C (liquidation sales). Technically sound with minor difference in price cap.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **✅ ALL FILTERS EXIST AND CORRECT:**
   ```
   ✓ Ownership type: is equal to Company
   ✓ Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
   ✓ Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
   ✓ Sales listing price: is less than 150000
   ✓ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
   ✓ Use class: is not one of [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   ```

2. **✅ SYNTAX CORRECT:**
   - All filters use proper operators
   - "is one of" for list-based filters ✓
   - "is not one of" for exclusions ✓

3. **⚠️ CAPITAL ALLOCATION DIFFERENCE:**
   - **Gemini:** £150k max price → £185k total spend
   - **Codex:** £400k max price → £190k total spend (deposit/option structure)
   - **Gemini approach = more conservative** (full acquisition under £150k)
   - **Trade-off:** Smaller pool but lower execution risk

4. **✅ LOGICAL COHERENCE:**
   - Lower price cap (£150k vs Codex £400k) = more restrictive
   - Excludes C3 (residential) = targets commercial/land opportunities ✓
   - Title area > 0.2 acres = meaningful development potential ✓

**Comparison to Codex Approach C:**

| Criteria | Gemini B | Codex C |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Price Cap | £150k | £400k |
| Strategy | Full acquisition | Deposit/option |
| Pool Size | Smaller (more restrictive) | Larger |
| Risk | Lower (smaller assets) | Higher (larger commitments) |
| Upside | Moderate (£150k → £400k) | Higher (£300k → £800k) |

**No Fixes Needed - Already Valid**

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £185k budget realistic
- Acquisition: £145k
- SDLT: £2.4k
- Legal: £8k
- Surveys: £5k
- Planning: £25k
- **Total: £185.4k** ✓

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £2M achievable but requires more sites  
- £145k → £400k with planning = £255k profit per site
- Need 8-10 successful sites to reach £2M
- **Challenge:** Finding 8-10 liquidation opportunities under £150k
- **More realistic:** £500k-£1M total profit from 3-4 sites
- **Recommendation:** Increase price cap to £300k for better opportunities

**Strategic Notes:**
- Technically flawless implementation
- **More conservative than Codex C** (lower price cap)
- Same excellent motivation signal (liquidation/administration)
- **Trade-off:** Safety vs opportunity size
- **Recommendation:** Consider hybrid approach:
  - 0-£200k: Full acquisition (like Gemini)
  - £200k-£500k: Option/deposit (like Codex)
  - Maximizes flexibility across price ranges

## GROK APPROACHES (2 Total)

### Grok - Approach A: High-Density Intensification Precedent
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Reasoning:** Good strategic concept but contains syntax errors and ambiguous filters that need clarification.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **⚠️ AMBIGUOUS FILTER - Line 2:**
   ```
   Current: Proposal: contains "storey"
   
   Issue: Valid syntax but may be too broad
   - Will match any proposal mentioning "storey" (includes refusals, single-storey, etc.)
   - Not filtering for approvals (no status filter available)
   
   Better: Proposal: contains "storey" AND "mixed"
   ```

2. **⚠️ AMBIGUOUS FILTER - Line 3:**
   ```
   Current: Proposal: contains "mixed-use"
   
   Note: This is valid but redundant with Building use group filter
   - Could use: Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use] instead
   - OR keep Proposal filter and remove Building use group
   ```

3. **✅ ALL FILTERS EXIST:**
   ```
   ✓ Max building height on title (m)
   ✓ Proposal
   ✓ Distance to nearest Train Station (m)
   ✓ Title area (acres)
   ✓ Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land
   ✓ Developed area percentage
   ```

4. **✅ UNITS CORRECT:**
   - Building height in metres ✓
   - Title area in acres ✓
   - Distance in metres ✓

5. **⚠️ MISSING CRITICAL FILTERS:**
   - No geographic targeting (will return UK-wide results)
   - No constraint filters (may include Conservation Areas, Flood Zones)
   - No motivation signals (sold date, ownership type, etc.)

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
✅ ENHANCED VERSION:
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Proposal: contains "mixed" AND "storey"
3. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
6. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
7. Developed area percentage: is greater than 40
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
9. Latest sold date: is before 2018-01-01  // Motivation signal
10. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3  // Low activity

Optional - Add PTAL if targeting London:
11. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £100k-£200k range is realistic for options

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £2M achievable with intensification precedent  
- Strategy is sound (high-density uplift near transport)
- **Challenge:** Needs better targeting filters for efficiency

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Core strategy is valid** (Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone)
- **Main weakness:** Insufficient filtering = very large result set
- Likely to return 1,000+ properties UK-wide
- **Needs:** Geographic focus + constraint exclusions
- **Recommendation:** Adopt Gemini Approach A filters (more refined)

---

### Grok - Approach B: Permitted Development Rights Conversion
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Reasoning:** Technically excellent PDR strategy with correct filters and comprehensive constraint exclusions.

**Technical Issues:**

1. **✅ ALL FILTERS EXIST AND SYNTAX CORRECT:**
   ```
   ✓ Use class: is one of [E, E(a), E(b), etc.]
   ✓ Property floor area (sqft)
   ✓ Title area (acres)
   ✓ NOT: Use class: is equal to [C3 dwellinghouses]
   ✓ NOT: Percentage of title covered by [constraints]
   ```

2. **✅ COMPREHENSIVE CONSTRAINT EXCLUSIONS:**
   - Flood Zone 2 ✓
   - Flood Zone 3 ✓
   - AONB ✓
   - Conservation Areas ✓
   - SSSI ✓
   - **This is the most thorough PDR filter set across all approaches**

3. **⚠️ MINOR SYNTAX REFINEMENT:**
   ```
   Current: NOT: Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2: is greater than 0
   
   Better syntax: Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 2]
   
   Note: Both work, but "Planning constraints" filter is cleaner
   ```

4. **⚠️ UNIT CONVERSION CHECK:**
   ```
   Current: Title area (acres): is less than 0.988
   
   Rationale: 0.988 acres ≈ 4,000 sqmt (Class MA site area limit)
   Calculation: 4,000 sqmt ÷ 4,047 sqmt/acre = 0.988 acres ✓ CORRECT
   ```

5. **✅ FLOOR AREA MINIMUM:**
   ```
   Current: Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 398
   
   Rationale: 398 sqft ≈ 37 sqmt (minimum for 1-bed flat)
   This is extremely small - likely meant to be inclusive
   Consider: is greater than 1000 (minimum viable conversion ~93 sqmt)
   ```

**Suggested Optimization:**

```
✅ STREAMLINED VERSION (Using Planning Constraints Filter):
1. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)]
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 1000 AND less than 100000
3. Title area (acres): is less than 0.988
4. Use class: does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
5. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3, National Landscapes (AONB), Conservation Area, Sites of Special Scientific Interest]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200  // Add for residential demand
7. Latest sold date: is before 2018-01-01  // Add motivation signal

Optional - Exclude Article 4:
8. Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0
```

**Capital Feasibility:** ✅ £110k-£220k budget realistic  
- Acquisition: £80k-£150k
- Conversion: £20k-£50k (internal fit-out)
- Fees: £10k-£20k
- **Note:** Upper end (£220k) exceeds £200k limit slightly
- **Adjustment:** Cap acquisition at £130k to stay within £200k total

**ROI Potential:** ✅ £1M-£2M achievable per property  
- £100k office → £300k residential conversion = £200k profit
- 5-10 conversions = £1M-£2M total profit
- **Key advantage:** PDR eliminates planning risk and delay

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Best technical implementation of PDR strategy** across all LLMs
- Most comprehensive constraint exclusions
- **Critical check:** Verify Article 4 does not apply (blocks PDR)
- **Improvement:** Add motivation signals (sold date, ownership type)
- **Recommendation:** Adopt this filter set for Class MA PDR strategy
- Consider combining with Codex C liquidation filter (distressed + PDR eligible)

---

## CROSS-CUTTING TECHNICAL PATTERNS

### Common Technical Errors Across LLMs:

1. **Non-Existent Filters (4 approaches):**
   - "Planning Status" (Claude A, Codex A)
   - "Development Type" (Claude A)
   - "Local Planning Authority" (Codex A)
   - **Impact:** Searches will fail completely

2. **Invalid OR Syntax (5 approaches):**
   - Using `'Value1' OR 'Value2'` instead of `contains any [Value1, Value2]`
   - **Impact:** Filter treats entire string as literal search term
   - **Affected:** Claude A, Codex B, Codex C (minor)

3. **Use Class Confusion (3 approaches):**
   - Mixing "Use class" with "Building use group" values
   - Using "Mixed" as a Use class (it's a Building use group)
   - **Impact:** No results or wrong results

4. **Article 4 Implementation Gap (1 approach):**
   - Claude B relies on Article 4 expiry dates (not in SearchLand)
   - **Impact:** Strategy cannot be executed via filters alone

### Strongest Technical Implementations:

1. **Gemini Approach A** - Cleanest precedent-based search (no non-existent filters)
2. **Grok Approach B** - Most comprehensive PDR strategy (thorough constraint exclusions)
3. **Codex Approach C / Gemini Approach B** - Best motivation-driven strategy (liquidation)

### Most Common Valid Filters (Successfully Used):

- ✅ Max building height on title (m) - 6/10 approaches
- ✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - 9/10 approaches
- ✅ Title area (acres) - 10/10 approaches
- ✅ Use class - 8/10 approaches
- ✅ Planning constraints / specific constraint % - 7/10 approaches
- ✅ Latest sold date - 4/10 approaches
- ✅ Applications in the last 5 years - 6/10 approaches

## KEY TECHNICAL LEARNINGS FOR FUTURE PROJECTS

### Filter Discovery Wins:
1. **"Company status: Liquidation"** - Powerful motivation signal, correctly used by Codex C & Gemini B
2. **Comprehensive PDR constraint exclusions** - Grok B demonstrates best practice
3. **Option agreement structure** - Gemini A shows best capital efficiency model

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
1. **Don't assume filters exist** - Always cross-reference AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
2. **Don't use OR operators within single filter line** - Use `contains any [value1, value2]` instead
3. **Don't mix Use class with Building use group values** - Separate taxonomies
4. **Don't forget constraint exclusions** - Flood Zone 3, Green Belt, Conservation Area are critical

### Best Practices Identified:
1. **Start with valid filters** - Test filter existence before building strategy
2. **Layer motivation signals** - Combine ownership age + inactive status + listing status
3. **Use conservative capital estimates** - Build in contingency (all Tier 1 approaches do this)
4. **Validate ROI with specific examples** - Codex C and Gemini A provide detailed profit calculations

### Critique_Codex

Claude - Approach A: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Strategy coherent but filters shown use non-existent names (“Planning Status”, “Development Type”, “Number of Storeys”, “Site Area”) and no full prompt provided. ROI assumes £1.5M uplift per site without showing disposal/development costs.  
Technical Issues: Uses invalid/ambiguous filters; unit for site area should be `Title area (acres)`; height should use `Max building height on title (m)` or `Max number of building floors on title`; no decision/status constraint to ensure approvals.  
Suggested Fixes: Rewrite prompt with real filters (`Decision: is one of [Approved]`, `Proposal: contains "mixed use"`, `Max building height on title (m): is greater than 18`, `Title area (acres): ...`, `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): ...`); model profit net of planning/selling costs to prove £2M target.

Claude - Approach B: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Article 4 expiry cannot be filtered directly in SearchLand; capital/ROI path plausible only if expiry geographies are pre-known.  
Technical Issues: No valid filters provided; Article 4 expiry data not available as a filter.  
Suggested Fixes: Use proxy (manual list of Article 4 boroughs with planned expiry → filter by LPA + `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Office subclasses]` + `Sales listing price`/`Ownership type`) and document manual overlay requirement; evidence ROI with comparables.

Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Stalled approvals concept workable but filters missing and no proof of £2M uplift across 3 sites.  
Technical Issues: No decision/date/activity filters; no capital allocation to acquire/option approved sites.  
Suggested Fixes: Use `Decision: is one of [Approved]`, `Latest application submitted: is before 2023-01-01`, `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2`, `Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes`; show option/JV structure to stay ≤£200k and profit assumptions.

Claude - Approach D: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: PDR conversion viable but Class MA has strict criteria not reflected.  
Technical Issues: No actual prompt; must limit floor area (<1,500 sqm ≈ 16,145 sqft), show 2-year E-class use, and avoid constraints (Article 4, flood, conservation).  
Suggested Fixes: Add filters (`Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Business and Service]`, `Property floor area (sqft): is less than 16145`, `Latest sold date: is before 2022-07-31`, `Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]`); include cost-to-convert and resale assumptions to reach £3M-£4M total.

Claude - Approach E: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Green Belt exception sites possible but very high planning risk; capital and ROI depend on HA partnership not evidenced.  
Technical Issues: No filters; must explicitly include Green Belt not exclude; land/affordable delivery costs likely exceed stated £10k-£20k/acre assumption.  
Suggested Fixes: Use `Planning constraints: contains any [Green Belt]`, `Title area (acres): is less than 2`, `Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70`; model HA/JV cashflows and planning costs to show £2.27M is achievable; include contingency for refusal.

Codex - Approach A: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Precedent match sound; prompt close but some filter names/operators off and ROI to £2M not demonstrated.  
Technical Issues: Should use `Max building height on title (m)`; `Conservation area` likely needs `Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]`; AND in height line may fail parser; lacks GDV/exit math.  
Suggested Fixes: Correct filter names/operators (`Decision: is one of [Approved]`, `Proposal: contains "mixed use"`, `Max building height on title (m): is greater than 18`, `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800`, `Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]`); add profit model showing path to £2M with 2-3 options.

Codex - Approach B: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Low-cap direct purchase matches £200k cap, but syntax errors and ROI from £150k sites to £2M not evidenced.  
Technical Issues: `Use class: contains "E" OR ...` invalid; Tenure needs `is one of [Freehold]`; flood filters should use `Planning constraints` or `% of title covered by Flood Zone`; `Applications in last 5 years` operator should be `is less than`; no build/exit costs.  
Suggested Fixes: `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Business and Service, Mixed Use]`; `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes`; `Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3]`; add financial model showing uplift route (PD/extension) to justify £2M.

Codex - Approach C: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Distress plus mixed-use viable; syntax and capital structure need tightening.  
Technical Issues: `Use class: contains "E" OR "Mixed"` invalid; `Ownership type` operator should be `is one of [Company]`; Conservation filter may need `Planning constraints`; £400k price cap exceeds £200k capital unless financing/JV detailed.  
Suggested Fixes: `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Business and Service, Mixed Use]`; `Ownership type: is one of [Company]`; `Sales listing price: is less than 400000` (no £ symbol); add explicit funding plan (option/assign/JV) and profit math to hit £2M.

Gemini - Approach A: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Low-rise to high-density via option works; operators off and capital (£65k) omits full planning budget; ROI not shown.  
Technical Issues: `Use class: is one of ...` should be `contains any`; need to state 8-storey target via height/floor filters; lack of planning/consultant costs beyond £65k.  
Suggested Fixes: `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Business and Service, Sui Generis]`; keep `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`; add `Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]`; include full planning/design budget and exit value to evidence £2M.

Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Distress purchase plausible but syntax errors and missing viability checks; 0.2+ acre liquidations under £150k rare.  
Technical Issues: `Ownership type: is equal to Company` should be `is one of`; `Use class: is not one of "C3..."` should be `does not contain [C3 - Dwellinghouses]`; no constraint/condition filters; no proof capital covers capex.  
Suggested Fixes: Correct operators; add `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes`, `Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, Conservation Area]`, `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200`; show financing/exit to reach target ROI.

Grok - Approach A: CONDITIONAL  
Reasoning: Intensification precedent idea works but prompt misses planning status and uses large plot sizes likely above £200k without option clarity.  
Technical Issues: No approval filter (`Decision`), no constraint exclusion beyond Green Belt, title area up to 5 acres conflicts with capital; developed area >40% contradicts “low-rise” goal.  
Suggested Fixes: Add `Decision: is one of [Approved]` or `Proposal year before 2023`; tighten plot band (e.g., `Title area (acres): is less than 1`); use `Max number of building floors on title: is less than 3`; ensure option/JV structure fits £200k.

Grok - Approach B: INVALID  
Reasoning: Class MA PDR conversion intent good, but filter syntax is not SearchLand-valid and omits mandatory PDR criteria; cap may exceed £200k.  
Technical Issues: Uses “NOT”/inline negations (unsupported); `Use class: is one of E, E(a)...` invalid formatting; must include 2-year E-class use and 1,500 sqm (16,145 sqft) cap; flood/AONB exclusions need proper `Planning constraints` syntax.  
Suggested Fixes: Rewrite prompt:  
- `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Business and Service]`

Here is the technical and business case validity review for each approach.

### Claude - Approach A: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The high-level strategy of replicating a precedent is valid and capital-efficient. However, the single technical example provided is invalid, as it uses non-existent filters and incorrect syntax. The overall approach is salvageable if implemented with correct filters.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Non-Existent Filter:** `Planning Status` does not exist. The workaround is using the `Decision` filter, which was not mentioned.
- **Non-Existent Filter:** `Development Type` does not exist. This should likely be `Property type` or `Use class`.
- **Incorrect Filter Name:** `Planning Description` should be `Proposal`.
- **Invalid Syntax:** Uses `OR` within a single filter line (e.g., `contains "Approved" OR "Permission Granted"`), which is not supported. The correct syntax is `contains any [...]` for list-based filters.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace `Planning Status` with a valid filter like `Decision`.
- Replace `Development Type` with `Property type` or `Use class`.
- Correct `Planning Description` to `Proposal`.
- Rewrite all `OR` statements using the correct `contains any [...]` syntax for list-based filters or separate `AND` conditions for text searches (e.g., `Proposal: contains "storey" AND Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`).

### Claude - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The strategy to target expiring Article 4 Directions is logically sound and represents a valid regulation-driven pattern. The capital arbitrage logic (buying at office value, profiting from residential uplift) is a standard, viable financial model. The use of option agreements makes it capital-feasible within the stated budget.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None noted in the high-level description. Assumes correct filters (`Use class`, `Article 4`) would be used.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

### Claude - Approach C: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The strategy targets a real-world inefficiency: approved-but-unimplemented planning permissions. The assumption of motivated sellers due to financing or timing issues is reasonable. This "time arbitrage" approach is viable and the use of options makes it capital-efficient.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None noted in the high-level description. Implementation would rely on date-based filters for `Last application submitted` and manual verification, which is a viable workflow.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

### Claude - Approach D: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The core strategy of using Permitted Development Rights (PDR) for conversions is valid. However, it incorrectly states that Class MA PDR applies to B2 (General Industrial) use class. Class MA applies to Class E. The strategy is valid if corrected to target appropriate Class E properties (formerly B1c).

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Logical Coherence:** Incorrectly identifies B2 as eligible for Class MA residential conversion. The correct class is E (which includes former B1c uses).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- The strategy should be revised to target `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial, Business and Service]` instead of B2 industrial buildings for Class MA conversions.

### Claude - Approach E: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach correctly identifies a niche but valid planning strategy: Green Belt exception sites for community-led housing. The financial model described (low capital entry at agricultural value, profit via cross-subsidy) is the standard and correct way such schemes are structured.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None noted in the high-level description.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

### Codex - Approach A: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically invalid as it relies fundamentally on two non-existent filters (`Local Planning Authority`, `Decision`) and uses incorrect syntax for others (`Conservation area`). Without the ability to filter by LPA or decision status, the core of the search cannot be executed as written.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Non-Existent Filter:** `Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough`. Geographic filtering is done at the UI level, not via a text filter.
- **Non-Existent Filter:** `Decision: is one of Approved`. The reference material explicitly states there is no "Planning Status" or "Decision" filter.
- **Incorrect Filter Name:** `Max building height (m)` should be `Max building height on title (m)`.
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Conservation area: is not within` should be `Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]`.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

### Codex - Approach B: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The prompt contains multiple, critical syntax errors that render it non-functional. It uses the unsupported `OR` operator, fails to use the correct list-based syntax for `Tenure`, and incorrectly tries to negate `Flood zone` filters. The logic also incorrectly includes "Mixed" as a `Use class`.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Tenure: Freehold` should be `Tenure: is one of [Freehold]`.
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"` is invalid. It uses `OR` and "Mixed" is not a valid `Use class` value.
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Flood zone 2: is not within AND Flood zone 3: is not within` is invalid. It should be a single filter: `Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 2, Flood Zone 3]`.
- **Incorrect Value:** `Sales listing currently on the market: Yes` should be `is equal to Yes`.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

### Codex - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The core strategic insight to target companies in liquidation or administration is excellent and uses a valid, powerful filter. However, the approach is plagued by repeated, basic syntax errors that make the prompt unusable as written. The strategy is sound, but the technical execution is flawed yet fixable.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Ownership type: is equal to Company` should be `Ownership type: is one of [Company]`.
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"` is invalid.
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Conservation area: is not within` should be `Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]`.
- **Incorrect Value:** `Building on title is derelict: Yes` and `Sales listing currently on the market: Yes` should use the `is equal to Yes` operator.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct all syntax errors as noted above, primarily replacing `OR` with `contains any [...]` and using the proper operators and filter names for constraints.

### Gemini - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a well-constructed and viable approach. The strategy of targeting under-developed commercial sites for high-density uplift is sound. The filters are logical, using proxies like long ownership and no recent applications to identify motivated off-market sellers. The capital breakdown is feasible for an option-based strategy. A minor syntax issue in one filter does not invalidate the overall approach.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Minor Syntax Issue:** `Use class: is one of ...` should technically be `Use class: contains any [...]`. Additionally, "Sui Generis" is not a selectable value; the correct value is "Outside of the defined classes". This is a minor, fixable issue.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change the `Use class` filter to `Use class: contains any ["E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Outside of the defined classes"]`.

### Gemini - Approach B: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy is excellent, targeting highly motivated sellers through the `Company status` filter for a direct acquisition. The financial logic is sound. However, the prompt contains two syntax errors that prevent it from running correctly. As the core idea is strong and the fixes are simple, the approach is conditional.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Ownership type: is equal to Company` should be `Ownership type: is one of [Company]`.
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Use class: is not one of "C3 - Dwellinghouses"` is invalid. The correct operator is `does not contain`, so it should be `Use class: does not contain ["C3 - Dwellinghouses"]`.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct `Ownership type` syntax to `is one of [Company]`.
- Correct the `Use class` negation to `Use class: does not contain ["C3 - Dwellinghouses"]`.

---
### Grok - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is technically and logically sound. The filters are all valid and correctly formatted. The strategy of using proposal keywords and building height to find intensification precedents is coherent. The financial plan is feasible, and the rationale shows a correct understanding of the available data (e.g., noting the limitation of PTAL).

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

### Grok - Approach B: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** This approach is technically and logically invalid. It uses a `NOT:` syntax that does not exist, gets multiple filter names wrong, and uses the incorrect operator for `Use class`. Critically, it misinterprets the Class MA PDR rules, applying a size limit to the `Title area (acres)` instead of the `Property floor area (sqft)` and using an incorrect converted value.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Invalid Syntax:** The `NOT:` prefix is entirely invalid. All such lines should use `does not contain` with the correct filter name (e.g., `Planning constraints: does not contain [...]`).
- **Invalid Syntax:** `Use class: is one of E, ...` is incorrect. It should be `Use class: contains any [...]`.
- **Logical/Unit Error:** The filter `Title area (acres): is less than 0.988` is a flawed interpretation of Class MA rules. The size limit (1,500 sqm, which is ~0.37 acres) applies to the cumulative floor area of the building, not the site area.
- **Incorrect Filter Names:** Uses "Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty" instead of the correct `National Landscapes (AONB)`, and "Conservation Areas" instead of the filter `Planning constraints`.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A
