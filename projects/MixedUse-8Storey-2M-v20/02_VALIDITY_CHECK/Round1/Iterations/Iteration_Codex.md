Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:
- Claude – Approach D (PDR B2→C3): Was CONDITIONAL, now INVALID because Class MA only covers Class E to C3; B2 (General Industrial) has no PDR route to residential. Even with sui generis claims, B2→C3 needs full planning, so the legal premise fails.

Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:
- Codex – Approach A (Slough 8-storey precedent): Still INVALID on filters because `Decision`/planning status and `Local Planning Authority` filters don’t exist in the available SearchLand list; must switch to proposal keywords + date proxies and geography via coordinates/areas or “Neighbouring Local Planning Authorities of.”
- Codex – Approaches B & C (Use class OR syntax): Still INVALID syntax as written; SearchLand supports single-condition filters and limited AND chaining, not inline OR within one line. Needs separate `Use class: is one of E, Mixed` entries or multiple lines without OR operators.
- Claude – Approach B (Article 4 expiry): Still INVALID business case; acquiring and converting three offices requires well over £200k equity (even one £200/sqft, 5k sqft building implies £1M purchase plus capex). No Article 4 expiry filter exists—only Article 4 coverage—so both technical and capital sides fail.
- Gemini – Approach B (Liquidation acquisition to £2M): Still INVALID business case; a £150k distressed purchase plus £35k fees can’t yield £2M without heavy development capex far beyond the £200k capital cap. Without an option/promotion or external finance plan, ROI target is infeasible.

Clarifications:
- Height filter naming: use `Max building height on title (m)` (as per available filters); minor naming precision only.
