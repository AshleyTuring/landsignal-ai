# Synthesis Task

## Your Role
You are the neutral synthesizer. Read all approaches and all critiques, then:

1. **Group Similar Approaches:** Identify natural convergence (LLMs proposing similar strategies)
2. **Preserve Distinct Approaches:** Identify genuinely different strategies worth testing
3. **Apply Critiques:** Use technical feedback to refine approaches
4. **Create Validation Matrix:** Mark each approach VALID/CONDITIONAL/INVALID
5. **Extract Ready-to-Test:** Create clean, executable prompts for SearchLand AI

## Key Principles
- **Preserve diversity:** Don't force convergence - multiple valid approaches can coexist
- **Apply technical fixes:** Use critique feedback to improve approaches
- **Be pragmatic:** CONDITIONAL approaches (minor issues) are still testable
- **Group smartly:** Similar approaches = natural consensus (not forced)

## Output Part 1: Validation Matrix

Create a table:

| Approach | Original LLM | Pattern Used | Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|-------|
| A | Gemini | Pattern X | VALID | Ready to test |
| B | Codex | Pattern Y | CONDITIONAL | Needs unit fix |
| C | Grok | Pattern Z | INVALID | Filter doesn't exist |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**Groupings (if applicable):**
- Approaches [A, D, G] are similar (precedent-based) - recommend testing as variants
- Approaches [B, E] both use Pattern X - recommend testing Approach B only (more refined)

## ALL APPROACHES (Original)

### Claude_Approaches

# Property Search Strategy Generation - Complete

I've generated **5 comprehensive, strategically diverse approaches** that meet all your requirements. Here's what I delivered:

---

## ✅ Requirements Met

### 1. **Precedent-Based Strategy (Mandatory)**
**Approach A: High-Density Mixed-Use Precedent Replication**
- Directly targets properties similar to the Slough 8-storey mixed-use approval
- Filters for: 6+ storeys, mixed retail/residential, strong transport links (PTAL 3+, <800m stations)
- Expected: 15-30 properties
- **Profit path:** £2M-£4M from 2-3 optioned sites

### 2. **Strategic Diversity Achieved (4 Non-Precedent Approaches)**

**Approach B: Article 4 Direction Expiry - Office to Resi**
- **Pattern:** Regulation-driven opportunities
- **Strategy:** Target offices in Article 4 areas (PDR currently blocked) where restrictions are expiring
- **Capital arbitrage:** Buy at office value (£200/sqft) → Convert to residential (£450/sqft) when Article 4 lifts
- **Profit path:** £2.8M from 3 buildings

**Approach C: Stalled Planning + Fresh Option Arbitrage**
- **Pattern:** Time arbitrage (information asymmetry)
- **Strategy:** Target 2022-2023 planning approvals that remain unimplemented (finance/timing issues)
- **Advantage:** Planning derisked, motivated sellers, immediate implementation possible
- **Profit path:** £2.17M from 3 sites

**Approach D: Permitted Development - Light Industrial to Resi**
- **Pattern:** Niche opportunities (Class MA PDR)
- **Strategy:** Convert B1c/B2 industrial buildings to residential using PDR (no planning needed)
- **Value uplift:** Industrial £100-£150/sqft → Residential £300-£500/sqft
- **Profit path:** £3M-£4M from 4 buildings

**Approach E: Green Belt Exception Sites - Community-Led Housing**
- **Pattern:** Community partnerships (exception site policy)
- **Strategy:** Deliver affordable housing on Green Belt land via Housing Association partnerships
- **Low capital:** Acquire at agricultural value (£10k-£20k/acre), profit from cross-subsidy market units
- **Profit path:** £2.27M from 1-2 schemes

---

## 📊 Strategic Diversity Matrix

| Category | Approaches | Strategic Angle |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Precedent-based** | A | Similar planning approvals (user requirement) |
| **Capital-efficient** | All approaches | Option agreements maximize £200k leverage |
| **Regulation-driven** | B, D | Article 4 expiry, PDR rights |
| **Time/information arbitrage** | C | Stalled planning, motivated sellers |
| **Niche opportunities** | D, E | PDR conversion, community-led |

---

## 🎯 How Each Approach Achieves £2M Profit on £200k Capital

### Common Capital-Efficient Structure:
All approaches use **option agreements** rather than outright purchase:
- **Option fee:** £5k-£20k per site (controls property without buying)
- **Exercise price:** Current use value (paid only when planning/PDR secured)
- **Your capital outlay:** £50k-£200k total across 3-6 sites
- **Profit mechanism:** Value uplift from planning/conversion - option exercise price

### Profit Examples:

**Approach A (Precedent):**
- Option 3 sites @ £15k each = £45k
- Site 1: £800k current value → £2.5M with 8-storey consent = **£1.5M profit**
- Site 2: Similar = **£1.5M profit**
- **Total: £3M**

**Approach D (Industrial PDR):**
- Option 6 buildings @ £15k each = £90k
- Building 1: £1.8M industrial → £3.5M with residential PDR = **£1.67M profit**
- 4 successful conversions × £1M average = **£4M total**

---

## 🔍 Filter Format - Ready for SearchLand

Each approach includes **copy-paste ready SearchLand AI prompts** in the required structured format:

**Example (from Approach A):**
```
1. Planning Status: contains "Approved" OR "Permission Granted"
2. Development Type: contains "Mixed Use" OR "Retail and Residential"
3. Planning Description: contains "storey" OR "storeys"
4. Number of Storeys: >= 6
5. Site Area: >= 0.1 acres
...
```

✅ Uses exact filter names from AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md  
✅ Correct units (acres, sqft, metres)  
✅ Numbered list format (not prose)  
✅ Proper operators (contains, >=, <=, etc.)

## 🎲 Recommended Execution Strategy

### **Option 1: Single Focus (Lower Risk)**
Execute **Approach A** (precedent-based) only:
- Allocate full £200k capital
- Option 5-8 sites similar to Slough approval
- Target: 2-3 planning approvals = £2M-£4M profit

### **Option 2: Diversified Portfolio (Balanced)**
Execute **Approach A + Approach C**:
- £100k each approach
- Approach A: Precedent-based (3 sites)
- Approach C: Stalled planning (3 sites)
- Diversifies across planning risk + time arbitrage
- Total target: £2M-£6M combined

### **Option 3: Maximum Diversification (Advanced)**
Execute **Approach A + D + E**:
- £70k each approach
- Covers: Precedent, PDR, community-led
- 15+ total opportunities
- Highest diversification, moderate capital per approach

---

## ✨ Key Differentiators

### Why These Strategies Work:

1. **Precedent Validation:** Approach A directly replicates proven Slough approval
2. **Market Inefficiencies:** Approaches B-E exploit knowledge gaps (Article 4 expiry, PDR eligibility, stalled planning)
3. **Capital Efficiency:** Option agreements provide 10-20x leverage on capital
4. **Multiple Exit Routes:** Sell consented, JV, implement, assign options
5. **Risk Diversification:** 5 approaches across different pattern categories

### Strategic Pattern Coverage:

### Codex_Approaches

## Approach A: Slough 8-Storey Precedent Match

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (precedent-led)  
**Capital Required:** £25k option + £35k planning pack + £60k surveys/fees + £60k JV/legal/holding = **£180k**  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough
2. Decision: is one of Approved
3. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
4. Proposal: contains "retail"
5. Proposal: contains "residential"
6. Max building height (m): is greater than 18 AND less than 30
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
9. Conservation area: is not within
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 3
```

**Rationale:** Targets already-approved mixed-use schemes with comparable height/mass in Slough, near rail to support 8-storey density; small-mid plots (0.15-0.6 acres) mirror urban parcels; low recent activity = potential to re-engage stalled owners. Pattern 5 leverages proven local precedent to de-risk planning.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent alignment to the 8-storey brief
- Approved status lowers planning risk
- Rail proximity supports height/mix arguments
- Tight plot band yields narrow, reviewable set
- Excludes conservation constraints

**Limitations:**
- Small supply; may cluster around few streets
- Height filter may exclude flexible massing options
- Approved schemes may have higher pricing expectations
- Limited to Slough LPA; no wider comps

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Pull shortlist from results; inspect decision notices for conditions/Section 106
- Contact owners/agents; propose option/JV citing comparable approval
- Refresh design for viability (NIA uplift, unit mix, retail sizing)
- Pre-app to validate any amendments; aim for minor material change
- Secure build cost updates; rebase GDV on latest sales

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option fee: £20k-£30k
- Planning/design/supporting studies: £30k-£40k
- Surveys (GIA, topo, UXO, transport): £20k-£30k
- Legals, SPV, CIL review, holding: £50k-£70k
- **Total:** ~£180k (within £200k)


## Approach B: Sub-£200k Mixed-Use Footfall Edge (Non-Precedent, Low-Cap Entry)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4A: Sub-£200k Direct Purchase + Motivated Seller signal  
**Capital Required:** £150k purchase + £20k legals/surveys + £20k planning prep + £10k contingency = **£200k**  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Sales listing price: is less than £200,000
2. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
3. Tenure: Freehold
4. Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"
5. Building on title is inactive: Yes
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
8. Developed area percentage: is less than 40
9. Flood zone 2: is not within AND Flood zone 3: is not within
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Combines low-ticket on-market assets with inactivity (motivation) near rail for resale/PD/intensification upside; small plot, low coverage supports adding resi above/beside. Fits cash+light works within £200k.

**Strengths:**
- Hard price cap aligns to capital
- Inactivity boosts negotiation leverage
- Rail proximity drives exit values
- Low site coverage = buildable slack
- On-market data enables quick offers

**Limitations:**
- Competition for cheap listings
- Condition risk if derelict/inactive
- PD applicability varies by use/sub-type
- Smaller plots limit scale of uplift

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Rapid desktop DCF on each listing; verify title/leases
- Offer with short exclusivity; include planning feasibility pack
- Target PD where viable (Class MA/G/AA) or small extension
- Phase works: secure consent → refinance/flip
- Keep capex light; prioritize planning gain over heavy build

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition: up to £150k
- Legals/surveys/valuation: £10k-£15k
- Planning/architect/transport daylight: £10k-£15k
- Contingency/holding: £15k-£25k
- **Total:** ~£200k


## Approach C: Distressed Company Mixed-Use Sites Near Stations (Non-Precedent, Motivation-Led)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D: Liquidation/Administration Sales  
**Capital Required:** £80k option/contract deposit + £40k legals/surveys + £50k planning prep + £20k contingency = **£190k**  
**Expected Results:** 5-20 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"
4. Building on title is derelict: Yes
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.7
7. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
8. Sales listing price: is less than £400,000
9. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 2
10. Conservation area: is not within
```

**Rationale:** Liquidation/administration forces sale; mixed-use/derelict assets near transport provide repositioning upside; price ceiling plus deposit/option structure keeps cash under £200k while pursuing planning-led uplift.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation → discounted pricing
- Mixed-use derelict = clear redevelopment story
- Rail proximity supports density/value
- Small-mid plots manageable within capital/JV
- Limited competition due to distress/legal complexity

**Limitations:**
- Small pool; may be dispersed geographically
- Insolvency sales can have title/charge complications
- Timelines driven by administrators
- Dereliction may hide structural issues

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Pull insolvency list; triage by location/plot fit
- Engage administrators with proof of funds + quick conveyance
- Secure exclusivity; commission surveys fast (structural, env)
- Draft concept layout to evidence uplift; negotiate price on CapEx
- Use bridge/partner equity post-exclusivity to complete

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/deposit: £60k-£90k
- Insolvency legal/technical due diligence: £15k-£25k
- Surveys (structural/env/topo): £10k-£15k
- Planning/architect/consultants: £35k-£45k
- Contingency/holding: £15k-£25k
- **Total:** ~£190k

## Approach A: High-Density Intensification via Option Agreement

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 5A (High-Density/Intensification) and Pattern 4B (Low Capital Entry)
**Capital Required:** £65,000 (Option Fee + Professional Fees)
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
4. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"
5. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
7. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
8. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets properties similar to the Slough precedent (8-storey mixed-use) but uses a low-capital entry strategy to fit the £200k budget. It identifies under-developed, low-rise commercial properties in transport-accessible locations, which have a strong policy basis for high-density uplift.

By combining Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) with indicators from Pattern 4B (Option Agreement Candidates) like long ownership (`Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01`) and no recent activity (`Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2`), we target owners who may be motivated to agree to an option, avoiding a large upfront capital purchase. The search is for off-market sites to reduce competition.

**Strengths:**
- Access to high-value development opportunities with low initial capital.
- Directly mimics the precedent's core concept: replacing a low-rise building with a high-density one.
- Strong planning argument based on transport accessibility and housing need.
- Off-market approach avoids competitive bidding.
- Leverages planning gain for profit, rather than requiring large construction capital upfront.

**Limitations:**
- Success is heavily dependent on successful negotiation of an option agreement.
- Owners may not be motivated to sell or may demand a high option fee.
- Planning risk still exists; securing consent for 8 storeys is not guaranteed.
- Requires a longer timeline to realize profit (planning process + eventual sale).
- Identifying the ultimate beneficial owner for off-market sites can be time-consuming.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the SearchLand query to generate a target list.
2.  **Research:** For the top 5-10 sites, conduct desktop due diligence. Research the owner via Land Registry and Companies House.
3.  **Approach:** Contact the owner directly with a well-researched proposal for an option agreement, contingent on achieving planning permission for an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.
4.  **Secure Option:** Negotiate and sign an option agreement for a 24-36 month period, paying an option fee.
5.  **Planning:** Appoint a planning consultant and architect to prepare and submit a pre-application, followed by a full planning application.
6.  **Exit:** Once planning is granted, either sell the site with the benefit of planning to a developer or execute the option and develop the scheme (likely requiring a JV partner or development finance).

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee (1-3% of estimated land value): £30,000
- Legal Fees (for option agreement): £10,000
- Initial Planning & Architectural Reports: £25,000
- **Total:** £65,000

---
## Approach B: Opportunistic Liquidation Acquisition

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)
**Capital Required:** £185,000 (Acquisition + Fees)
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
4. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
6. Use class: is not one of "C3 - Dwellinghouses"
```

**Rationale:**
This is a diverse, non-precedent-based strategy focused on extreme seller motivation. It leverages the "Company status" filter, a powerful tool identified in the LEARNINGS_DATABASE, to find assets being sold by liquidators or administrators. These are forced sales, creating an opportunity to acquire property at a significant discount to market value.

The target profit of £2M from a £200k outlay requires a high-leverage strategy; acquiring a discounted asset is a prime example. By filtering for a low price (`< £150,000`) and a decent size (`> 0.2 acres`), we target sites where the £200k capital can cover the full acquisition cost, leaving room for planning fees to add significant value. We exclude standard residential (C3) to focus on commercial or land sites with greater redevelopment potential.

**Strengths:**
- Targets sellers with the highest possible motivation (legal obligation to sell).
- High potential for below-market-value acquisition.
- Faster transaction times, as liquidators are motivated to close deals quickly.
- Reduced competition as these are specialist situations.
- Strong negotiating position for a cash-ready buyer.

**Limitations:**
- Very limited pool of available properties at any given time.
- Properties may have significant legal, structural, or contamination issues.
- The "story" behind the liquidation may be complex and require thorough due diligence.
- Competition from other distressed asset funds/investors.
- Properties are often sold "as-is," with limited warranties or guarantees.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the SearchLand query. Due to the rarity of these opportunities, this search should be run frequently (daily/weekly).
2.  **Triage:** Immediately assess any matching properties. Review the agent's details and the nature of the administration/liquidation.
3.  **Due Diligence:** Act quickly. Instruct a solicitor to review the legal pack. Conduct a site visit to assess the physical condition and redevelopment potential.
4.  **Offer:** Make a clean, decisive offer, emphasizing speed and certainty of funds. Cash offers are heavily preferred.
5.  **Acquire:** Purchase the property.
6.  **Value-Add & Exit:** With the asset secured at a low base cost, there are multiple routes to profit:
    *   **Planning Gain:** Apply for planning for a higher-value use (e.g., residential, mixed-use) and sell the site on.
    *   **Refurbish & Re-let:** If a building exists, refurbish it and let it to generate income.
    *   **Flip:** If the discount was deep enough, simply re-market the property to a mainstream buyer.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition Price: £145,000
- Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) on commercial property: £2,400
- Legal & Professional Fees: £8,000
- Initial Survey/Report Costs: £5,000
- Planning Application Fee: £25,000
- **Total:** £185,400

### Grok_Approaches

### Approach A: High-Density Intensification Precedent
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Proposal: contains "storey"
3. Proposal: contains "mixed-use"
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
6. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
7. Developed area percentage: is greater than 40
```

**Rationale:**  
This approach targets low-rise buildings in accessible locations with existing planning proposals for multi-storey mixed-use developments, directly replicating the precedent of the approved 8-storey mixed-use scheme in Slough. By focusing on sites with "storey" and "mixed-use" keywords in proposals, it identifies properties with demonstrated development intent similar to the Slough approval. The pattern leverages Pattern 5A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md for intensification potential, combined with transport accessibility (via train station proximity) to ensure viability, as seen in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md insights on transport filters. Capital stays within £200k through option agreements or direct purchases of undervalued sites.

**Strengths:**
- Directly precedents the approved Slough 8-storey mixed-use development by targeting similar proposal types
- Combines motivation (existing planning interest) with development upside (low-rise to high-density conversion)
- Transport proximity adds marketability and policy support for intensification
- Narrow filter set reduces noise while targeting viable sites

**Limitations:**
- PTAL filter limited to London (not applicable to Slough), so relies on train station proxy which may include less optimal locations
- Planning approval not guaranteed despite precedent similarity
- Competition from developers targeting similar intensification opportunities
- Requires local policy research for tall building zones outside London

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify candidate sites; prioritize those with recent proposals containing "8-storey" or "mixed-use" keywords.
2. Research local planning policies in target areas (e.g., Slough or similar) for tall building support.
3. Approach owners with option agreements (£50k-£100k deposits) contingent on planning approval.
4. Secure planning permission for 8-storey mixed-use intensification.
5. Develop or sell to housebuilder at planning stage for profit realization.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option deposits: £50,000-£100,000
- Planning application fees: £20,000-£50,000
- Legal/due diligence: £10,000-£30,000
- **Total:** £80,000-£180,000 (within £200k limit, with profit from resale/development)

---

### Approach B: Permitted Development Rights Conversion
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 7A: Class MA (Commercial to Residential)  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 398
3. Title area (acres): is less than 0.988
4. NOT: Use class: is equal to C3 dwellinghouses
5. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2: is greater than 0
6. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is greater than 0
7. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: is greater than 0
8. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is greater than 0
9. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Sites of Special Scientific Interest: is greater than 0
```

**Rationale:**  
This completely different strategy (not precedent-based) exploits Permitted Development Rights for Class MA conversions, allowing commercial buildings to residential without full planning. It uses Pattern 7A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md, targeting E-class commercial properties eligible for conversion, as detailed in PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md (Preset #4). Unlike the intensification approach, this focuses on regulatory arbitrage rather than replicating specific planning precedents, with capital feasibility through direct purchases or options. Profit potential comes from converting commercial space to residential units, leveraging SearchLand's built-in profit calculations for Class MA.

**Strengths:**
- PDR eliminates full planning risk and timeline (faster than traditional development)
- SearchLand calculates profit automatically for eligible sites
- Lower capital entry compared to ground-up construction
- Clear regulatory framework with proven conversion rates

**Limitations:**
- Limited to E-class commercial buildings with 2+ years of use
- Size restrictions (title <4,000 sqmt) and exclusions (flood zones, AONB, etc.) narrow pool
- Requires 2-year commercial use period (cannot convert immediately)
- Profit depends on local residential values, which vary geographically

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify Class MA-eligible commercial properties.
2. Verify 2-year commercial use and structural suitability for residential conversion.
3. Purchase or option sites (£100k-£150k) and initiate conversion works.
4. Convert to residential units and sell for profit.
5. Monitor for Article 4 directions that could restrict PDR in target areas.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Property acquisition: £80,000-£150,000
- Conversion costs (internal fit-out): £20,000-£50,000
- Legal/fees: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £110,000-£220,000 (adjust to stay within £200k, with profit from unit sales)

## ALL CRITIQUES


## REFERENCE MATERIALS (ALL CONTENT INCLUDED BELOW)

## REFERENCE: SearchLand Available Filters (CRITICAL - Use ONLY These)

# SearchLand Available Filters

**Source:** Direct from SearchLand interface (HTML parsed)  
 
**IMPORTANT:** ⚠️ CRITICAL: If the constrained value or permitted filter value is not in here you can still use the filter and assume what the filter value could be. This is a living document and will be updated as we use each filter - dont be afraid of using filters. 

---

##  Filter Operators for List-Based Filters

**Many SearchLand filters use predefined value lists (not free text).** These filters have specific operators:

### Available Operators for List-Based Filters:

| Operator | Logic | Example |
|----------|-------|---------|
| **contains any** | OR (implicit) - matches if ANY selected value is present | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| **contains all** | AND (implicit) - matches only if ALL selected values present | `Use class: contains all [E, C3]` |
| **does not contain** | Exclusion - excludes if value is present | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| **is equal to** | Exact match - only this specific value | `Use class: is equal to [E]` |

### ❌ INVALID Syntax (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Use class: E AND C3
```

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ✅ CORRECT Syntax:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]
✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** (predefined planning classes)
- **Property type** (Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.)
- **Property classification** (separate taxonomy from Use class)
- **Tenure** (Freehold, Leasehold, etc.)
- **Ownership type** (Corporate, Individual, etc.)
- Any filter showing checkbox options in the UI

### Text/Numeric Filters (Use comparison operators):
- **Title address:** `contains`, `does not contain` (free text)
- **Proposal:** `contains` (free text keyword search)
- **Title area (acres):** `is greater than`, `is less than`, `is equal to` (numeric)
- **Price:** `is greater than`, `is less than` (numeric)

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: List-Based Filter Operators (MOST COMMON ERROR)

**ISSUE:** LLMs frequently write invalid syntax for filters with predefined value lists (Use class, Property type, etc.)

### The Problem

SearchLand filters with **predefined value lists** (shown as checkboxes in UI) use specific operators:
- `contains any` (OR logic - matches if ANY value is present)
- `contains all` (AND logic - requires ALL values)
- `does not contain` (exclusion)
- `is equal to` (exact match)

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ❌ INVALID Examples (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
   // SearchLand does not support OR operators within a filter line

❌ Use class: contains 'E' AND Use class: contains 'C3'
   // SearchLand does not support AND operators within a filter line

❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
   // Wrong syntax - no OR operators

❌ Use class: E AND C3
   // Wrong syntax - no AND operators
```

**Why This Fails:**
- SearchLand's AI prompt parser does not recognize `OR`/`AND`/`NOT` as operators
- It treats the entire string as a literal search term
- The filter will return zero results or unexpected matches

### ✅ CORRECT Examples:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Multiple values in single filter with "contains any" operator
   // This matches properties with EITHER E OR C3 (implicit OR)

✅ Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Requires BOTH E AND C3 to be present (implicit AND)

✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
   // Correct: Excludes properties with B2 use class

✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use, Residential]
   // Correct: Matches any of these property types

✅ Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
   // Correct: Exact match for single value
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** - Planning use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Property type** - Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.
- **Property classification** - Separate taxonomy from Use class
- **Tenure** - Freehold, Leasehold, etc.
- **Ownership type** - Corporate, Individual, etc.
- **Any filter showing checkbox options in UI**

### Syntax Pattern:

```
[Filter name]: [operator] [comma-separated list of values in square brackets]
```

**Examples:**
```
Use class: contains any [E, C3, C4]
Property type: does not contain [Agricultural]
Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
```

### Common Corrections:

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |
|-------------|-----------|
| `Use class: contains 'E' OR 'C3'` | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| `Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Mixed'` | `Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]` |
| `Use class: NOT 'B2'` | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| `Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'` | `Tenure: contains any [Freehold, Leasehold]` |

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**Boolean Operators in List-Based Filters:**
```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'C3'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
```
- List-based filters do NOT support `OR`, `AND`, `NOT` operators within a single filter line
- **Correct:** `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]`
- Use `contains any` for OR logic, `contains all` for AND logic

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

---

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]

## Newly Documented Filters (v5.2.3)

### Property Type

**Context:**
- Simple residential/commercial classification (different from "Property classification")
- Only 5 values: Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial
- Used for basic property type filtering

**Operators:** `contains all`, `contains any`, `does not contain`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property type: contains any [Detached, Semi-Detached]
Property type: contains all [Commercial, Flat]  // Mixed-use commercial flats
Property type: does not contain [Terraced]
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property type: Detached AND Semi-Detached
```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Do NOT confuse with "Property classification" (which has 500+ values)

---

### Tenure

**Context:**
- Legal ownership structure
- 5 values: Leasehold, Freehold, Pending first registration, Caution against first registration, Rentcharge
- Critical for acquisition strategy (Freehold = full ownership, Leasehold = time-limited)

**Operator:** `is one of` (implicit OR)

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Leasehold, Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Pending first registration]  // Unregistered land - potential opportunity
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'
❌ Tenure: NOT 'Leasehold'
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Freehold only:** For long-term hold/development (no ground rent complications)
- **Leasehold:** Can indicate motivated sellers (especially short leases <80 years)
- **Pending first registration:** Unregistered land - may have title issues but also opportunities

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Combine with "Lease end date" for leasehold properties to find short leases

---

### Property Classification

**Context:**
- Comprehensive taxonomy with ~500+ values across 24 major categories
- Separate from "Use class" (planning) - this is Ordnance Survey classification
- Hierarchical: Commercial > Hotel/Motel > Youth Hostel (example)
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT mix with "Use class" values

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**Major Categories:**
- Commercial, Education, Hotel/Motel, Industrial, Leisure, Medical, Animal Centre, Office, Broadcasting, Retail, Storage Land, Transport, Utility, Emergency/Rescue, Information, Land, Water, Military, Other, Parent Shell, Residential, Unclassified, Dual Use, Object of Interest

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property classification: contains any [Commercial, Residential]
Property classification: contains all [Development Site, Residential Construction Site]
Property classification: does not contain [Military, Prison]
Property classification: exactly matches [Hotel/Motel]
Property classification: contains any [Vacant / Derelict Land, Development Site]  // Opportunity sites
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property classification: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property classification: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]  // WRONG - that's Use class, not classification
❌ Property classification: Development Site AND Residential  // Use 'contains all' instead
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Development Site:** Active construction - may indicate market activity
- **Vacant / Derelict Land:** Potential redevelopment opportunities
- **Care / Nursing Home:** For care home conversion strategies
- **Hotel/Motel:** For hotel-to-residential conversions
- **Warehouse / Store / Storage Depot:** For industrial-to-residential conversions

**Performance/Notes:**
- Slower filter due to large value set - use strategically
- More granular than "Property type" but less planning-specific than "Use class"
- Can combine with "Use class" for precision (e.g., Classification: Hotel + Use class: C3 for converted hotels)

---

### PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level)

**Context:**
- London-specific metric (Transport for London)
- 9 values: 0 (Worst), 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)
- Higher = better public transport access = higher land values + planning support for density
- **CRITICAL:** Only available in London - will return zero results elsewhere

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
PTAL: contains any [6a, 6b (Best)]  // Excellent transport - supports tall buildings
PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]  // Good to excellent
PTAL: does not contain [0 (Worst), 1a, 1b]  // Exclude poor transport areas
PTAL: exactly matches [6b (Best)]  // Only the very best
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ PTAL: '6a' OR '6b'
❌ PTAL: is greater than 4  // Not a numeric filter - use 'contains any' with list
❌ PTAL: High  // Must use exact values (0, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b)
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **High-density development:** PTAL 4+ supports planning for tall buildings
- **Residential demand:** PTAL 5+ = premium pricing for car-free living
- **Planning policy:** Many London boroughs require PTAL 3+ for car-free developments
- **Opportunity:** PTAL 2-3 areas with planned transport improvements (check TfL plans)

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- **London only** - always combine with London geography filters
- Use with "Distance to nearest Train Station" for non-London areas
- PTAL ratings can change - check TfL website for planned improvements

**Related Filters:**
- Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - for non-London areas
- Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m)
- Distance to nearest Rapid Transit Stop/Station (m)

---

### Planning Constraints

**Context:**
- 34 constraint types covering environmental, heritage, policy, and flood risk
- Critical for assessing development viability
- Some are absolute blockers (Green Belt, SSSI), others provide policy support (Housing Zones)
- **IMPORTANT:** "Built up areas" is POSITIVE (urban context), not a constraint to avoid

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (34 constraints)
- **Absolute Blockers:** Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, World heritage sites, Scheduled Monuments, National Parks, National Landscapes (AONB)
- **Flood Risk:** Flood Zone 2 (negotiable), Flood Zone 3 (major blocker)
- **Policy Support (SEEK):** Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas, Areas Of Intensification, Site Allocations, Built up areas
- **Heritage:** Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer (less restrictive), Parks and Gardens, Battlefields
- **Environmental:** SAC, SPA, RAMSAR, National Nature Reserves, Local Nature Reserves, Country Parks, CROW
- **Urban Planning:** Central Activities Zone (London), SIL, LSIS, Town Center Boundaries, Designated Open Space
- **Other:** Tree Preservation Order (TPO), Nutrient Neutrality

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]  // Avoid major blockers
Planning constraints: contains any [Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas]  // Seek policy support
Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Exclude protected sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Housing Zones, Built up areas]  // Urban housing policy areas
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]  // Exclude Green Belt only
Planning constraints: contains any [Site Allocations]  // Sites allocated for development in local plan
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Planning constraints: NOT 'Green Belt'
❌ Planning constraints: 'Green Belt' OR 'Conservation Area'
❌ Planning constraints: does not contain [Built up areas]  // WRONG - Built up areas is GOOD!
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Urban Brownfield Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
   ```

2. **High-Density Development (London):**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [Central Activities Zone, Opportunity Areas]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
   ```

3. **Avoid All Major Blockers:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   ```

4. **Industrial Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [SIL, LSIS]  // Strategic/Locally Significant Industrial - may be released
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
   ```

5. **Flood Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3]  // Exclude high risk
   Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 2]  // Accept Zone 2 (mitigation possible)
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Use "Percentage of plot un-constrained" to find sites with minimal coverage (e.g., >80%)
- **Critical distinction:** "Built up areas" = urban context (GOOD), NOT a development blocker
- Green Belt = ~13% of England - major constraint but some brownfield exceptions exist
- Conservation Areas = ~2% of England - design restrictions, not necessarily a blocker
- Flood Zone 3 = high risk - insurance issues, planning refusal likely
- Flood Zone 2 = medium risk - mitigation measures required but achievable

**Related Filters:**
- Percentage of plot un-constrained (%) - Find sites with <20% constraint coverage
- Area of plot un-constrained (acres) - Absolute unconstrained area
- Percentage of title covered by Green Belt - Partial coverage may be workable
- Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2/3 - Assess flood risk extent

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Clean sites for quick planning
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80

# Policy-supported urban sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]

# Heritage-adjacent (not on-site)
Planning constraints: contains any [Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Near but not on
```

### Building Use Group

**Context:**
- High-level functional classification - 17 categories
- Less granular than "Use class" (planning), more functional than "Property type"
- Good for broad filtering before applying detailed "Use class" filters
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly listed as a category (unlike in Property type)

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (17 categories)
- **Commercial:** Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing, Commercial Activity: Other
- **Residential:** Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation
- **Public Services:** Education, Government Services, Medical or Emergency Services
- **Infrastructure:** Transport, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Construction
- **Other:** Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Attraction Sports or Activity, Religious Worship and Funeral Services, Mixed Use, Unknown

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other]
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection]
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // All residential types
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail]  // Retail focus
Building use group: does not contain [Unknown]  // Exclude unclear properties
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Building use group: 'Mixed Use' OR 'Commercial'
❌ Building use group: NOT 'Agriculture'
❌ Building use group: contains any [C3, E]  // WRONG - those are Use class values, not Building use group
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Broad Commercial Search:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]
   ```

2. **Exclude Non-Development Sites:**
   ```
   Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
   ```

3. **Mixed-Use Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
   // Then refine with specific Use class filters
   ```

4. **Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // Hotels to residential
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]  // Industrial to residential
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Good for initial broad filtering, then refine with "Use class"
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly tagged - useful for precedent-based searches
- "Unknown" category exists - may want to exclude or investigate separately
- More intuitive than "Use class" codes but less planning-specific

**Relationship to Other Filters:**
- **Broader than:** Use class (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Narrower than:** Property type (Detached, Commercial, etc.)
- **Different from:** Property classification (OS taxonomy)

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Broad commercial search, then refine
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other]
Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]

# Residential focus with mixed-use
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Mixed Use]
Property type: contains any [Flat, Commercial]

# Exclude unsuitable for development
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
```

# Reusable Filter Strategy Patterns

**Version:** v2.2 (List-Based Filter Syntax Guide Added)  
**Purpose:** Proven filter strategies that can be adapted across projects  
**Scope:** Strategic approaches AND correct syntax for SearchLand filters  
**Usage:** LLMs should reference these patterns when creating divergent approaches

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: SearchLand Filter Syntax Guide

**BEFORE using any pattern below, read this syntax guide to avoid invalid filters.**

### Two Types of Filters

#### 1. **List-Based Filters** (Predefined Values)
Filters with checkbox options in UI (Use class, Property type, Ownership type, etc.)

**Available Operators:**
- `contains any` - OR logic (matches if ANY value is present)
- `contains all` - AND logic (requires ALL values)  
- `does not contain` - Exclusion
- `is one of` - Multiple selection (implicit OR)
- `is equal to` - Exact match (single value)

**Syntax Pattern:**
```
[Filter name]: [operator] [value1, value2, value3]
```

**✅ CORRECT Examples:**
```
Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
Property type: is one of [Commercial, Mixed Use]
Ownership type: is one of [Corporate, Company]
Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
```

**❌ INVALID Examples (DO NOT USE):**
```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'C3'
   // SearchLand does NOT support OR operators within a filter line

❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
   // No OR operators - use 'is one of' or 'contains any'

❌ Use class: E AND C3
   // No AND operators - use 'contains all' instead

❌ Ownership type: NOT 'Private owner'
   // No NOT operators - use 'does not contain' instead
```

#### 2. **Text/Numeric Filters** (Free Input)
Filters where you type values (Title address, Proposal, Price, Area, etc.)

**Text Operators:** `contains`, `does not contain`, `is equal to`
**Numeric Operators:** `is greater than`, `is less than`, `is equal to`, `AND` (for ranges)

**✅ CORRECT Examples:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
Price: is less than 500000
Title address: contains "London"
```

### Common List-Based Filters:
- **Use class** - Planning classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Property type** - Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.
- **Property classification** - Separate from Use class (don't mix!)
- **Ownership type** - Corporate, Council, Housing Association, Company, Private owner
- **Tenure** - Freehold, Leasehold, etc.
- **Planning constraints** - Green Belt, Conservation Area, etc.
- **PTAL** - 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b

### When in Doubt:
1. Check `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` - lists all filters with `[LIST-BASED]` tag
2. Check `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` - has syntax examples
3. **NEVER use OR/AND/NOT operators within a single filter line**

---

## 1. Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies

### Pattern A: Old Planning + No Recent Activity
```
Strategy: Find sites with old planning applications and no recent development activity
Indicators:
- Last application submitted: >2-3 years ago
- Applications in last 5 years: <3
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Max number of dwellings applied for: >0 (confirms development intent)

Strengths: Targets sites where planning work already done but stalled
Weaknesses: May miss sites with expired planning but recent resubmissions
Capital requirement: Varies (often requires on-market listing filter)
```

### Pattern B: Proposal Keyword + Inactive Building
```
Strategy: Search for specific development types with inactive buildings
Indicators:
- Proposal: contains "[development type]" keywords
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Title area: appropriate size for target development

Strengths: More flexible than date-based approaches
Weaknesses: Doesn't confirm planning has actually lapsed
Capital requirement: Add price filters as needed
```

---

## 2. Motivated Seller Strategies

### Pattern A: Long Corporate Hold + Derelict Asset
```
Strategy: Corporate owners holding derelict assets for 5+ years
Indicators:
- Ownership type: Company
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago
- Building on title is derelict: Yes
- Optional: Sales listing currently on the market: Yes

Strengths: Strong motivation signals (asset write-down, non-core holding)
Weaknesses: Limited pool of properties
Capital requirement: Often suitable for low-capital strategies
```

### Pattern B: Long Market Listing + Price Cap
```
Strategy: Properties listed for extended periods with price constraints
Indicators:
- Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
- Sales listing price: <target amount
- Latest sold date: >3-5 years ago (long hold)

Strengths: Active sellers with demonstrated motivation
Weaknesses: Cannot directly filter for "time on market"
Capital requirement: Directly constrained by price filter
```

### Pattern C: Inactive Building + Transport Proximity
```
Strategy: Inactive/derelict properties near transport (redevelopment angle)
Indicators:
- Building on title is inactive OR derelict: Yes
- Distance to nearest Train Station: <500-1000m
- Title area: appropriate size

Strengths: Combines motivation with development rationale
Weaknesses: Transport proximity doesn't guarantee motivation
Capital requirement: Add price filters for low-capital approaches
```

### Pattern D: Liquidation/Administration Sales ⭐ NEW

## Master Strategy Matrix 🎯

Quick reference for pattern selection based on constraints:

| Pattern # | Pattern Name | Capital Required | Risk Level | Timeline | Best For |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|------------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | £50k-£200k | Medium | 12-24 months | Planning expertise, opportunistic buyers |

## Collaborative Round Guide 🔄

Maps patterns to exploration rounds in the v3.2.0 workflow:

### Round 2: Precedent Analysis
**Goal:** Which patterns help replicate successful planning applications?
- Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning (find similar approved schemes)
- Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (PTAL matching)
- Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly (precedent for infill)
- Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion (prior approvals)

**Why these patterns?** These rely on demonstrating that similar developments have been approved nearby or on similar sites. Success depends on finding comparable precedents.

### Round 3: Regulation-Driven
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit regulatory drivers and deadlines?
- Pattern 7: Permitted Development (Class AA, Q, MA, ZA rights)
- Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Article 4, expiring conditions)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (enforcement, S215 notices)

**Why these patterns?** These opportunities are created by regulatory changes, deadlines, or enforcement actions that create urgency or unlock new rights.

### Round 4: Structural Arbitrage
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit physical characteristics and constraints?
- Pattern 6: Airspace Development (roof extensions, party wall arbitrage)
- Pattern 9: Green Belt/Strategic Land (boundary anomalies, brownfield)
- Pattern 3: Underutilized/Inefficient Sites (layout inefficiencies)
- Pattern 4: Title/Access Issues (ransom strips, easements)

**Why these patterns?** These exploit physical, spatial, or legal constraints that others overlook or cannot solve. Value creation comes from structural problem-solving.

### Round 5: Behavioral/Motivation
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit seller motivation and market timing?
- Pattern 2: Motivated Seller (estate settlements, divorces, financial distress)
- Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage (Advanced Workflow) (emerging allocations, infrastructure announcements)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (combined with motivation)

**Why these patterns?** These depend on understanding seller psychology, market inefficiencies, and information asymmetries. Success requires empathy and timing.

### Cross-Round Patterns
Some patterns work across multiple rounds:
- **Pattern 11** (Distressed Assets): Regulation-driven (enforcement) + Behavioral (motivated seller)
- **Pattern 1** (Expired Planning): Precedent Analysis (prior approval) + Behavioral (frustrated owner)
- **Pattern 13** (Time Arbitrage): Regulation-Driven (policy changes) + Behavioral (information gaps)

## 4. Low Capital Entry Strategies

**NOTE:** Enhanced in v2.1 based on Codex review - added concrete filter examples for executability

### Pattern A: Sub-£200k Direct Purchase
```
Strategy: Direct freehold/leasehold purchase under capital limit
Source: User strategy (no direct preset)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Sales listing price: is less than £200,000
2. Tenure: Freehold
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
4. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
5. Use class: Contains "Residential" OR "Mixed"
6. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3

Indicators:
- Sales listing price: <£200,000 (adjust to your capital)
- Tenure: Freehold (avoid leasehold complications)
- Title area: 0.1-0.5 acres (adequate size without excess land cost)
- On market: Yes (immediate availability)

Strengths: Direct acquisition within budget, clear pricing
Weaknesses: Very limited supply; may sacrifice quality/location
Capital requirement: Hard cap at budget limit (£10k-£200k typical)
```

### Pattern B: Option Agreement Candidates
```
Strategy: Higher-value sites suitable for option agreements (low upfront capital)
Source: User strategy + Pattern 2 (Motivated Seller) overlap

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Latest sold date: No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
2. Ownership type: Private owner OR Company
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no recent activity)
5. NOT: Sales listing currently on the market (off-market approach)
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago OR never sold (motivated seller potential)
- Ownership type: Private owner or Company (institutional negotiation)
- Title area: 1-10 acres (large enough for phased development)
- No recent applications (owner not actively developing)
- OFF-MARKET (no listing price filter - approach directly)

Strengths: Access to better sites with low initial capital (£10k-£50k option fee)
Weaknesses: Requires negotiation skills, legal costs, seller must agree
Capital requirement: £10k-£50k for option + £5k-£15k legals

Strategy Steps:
1. Identify site via filters above
2. Research title owner (Land Registry)
3. Approach with option proposal (planning-contingent)
4. Secure option for 12-24 months
5. Apply for planning or sell option to developer
```

### Pattern C: Derelict Asset Turnaround

Strategy: Severely derelict properties with rebuild/redevelopment angle
Source: User strategy + Pattern 2C (Motivated Seller) overlap

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Building on title is derelict: Yes
2. Sales listing price: is less than £150,000 (adjust to budget - acquisition costs)
3. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 1000m (exit value/marketability)
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.25
5. Tenure: Freehold
6. NOT: Conservation area, Listed building (reduces complexity)

Indicators:
- Building derelict: Yes (distressed pricing)
- Listing price: <£150k (allows rebuild budget)
- Transport proximity: <1km train station (residential appeal)
- Title area: 0.05-0.25 acres (adequate but not excessive)

## 9. Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: Grey Belt Exception
```
Strategy: Previously developed land in Green Belt (exception to protection)
Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

Strengths:
- Access to Green Belt locations (often cheaper)
- Exception to normal GB restrictions
- Less competition (many avoid GB entirely)

Weaknesses:
- Still needs planning (not automatic)
- Local opposition possible
- Must prove "previously developed"

Capital requirement: Often cheaper than pure urban (£50k-£300k)

Example Filters:

Grey Belt (Preset #7):
1. Freehold tenure
2. More than 25% area developed
3. More than 10% hardstanding (key indicator)
4. Within 100m of built up area
5. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3, National parks, Conservation area, etc.
6. 1,000+ sqmt

Grey Belt Low Impact (Preset #44):

2. More than 25% hardstanding
3. Within 100m of built up area
4. NOT: Flood zone 3, Conservation area, AONB

Strategic Insight:
"Previously developed land in Green Belt" = exception
Hardstanding % = proxy for "previously developed"

Related: Presets #7, #43, #44, #45 (GB solar)
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "Hardstanding percentage"
```

### Pattern B: Edge of Settlement Promotion
```
Strategy: Sites on settlement edges for local plan inclusion
Source: SearchLand Presets #13, #18, #85, #86

- NOT SHLAA assessed OR negative (hidden gems)
- Private owner (easier to deal)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 5% developed (undeveloped land)

Strategic Rationale:
- Local authorities review settlement boundaries periodically
- Sites on edges = natural expansion direction
- No SHLAA = no one else promoting (first mover advantage)
- Promote to get allocated in next local plan

Strengths:
- Lower competition (undiscovered)
- Can influence local plan
- Option agreements with minimal capital
- Value jump when allocated

Weaknesses:
- Long timeline (2-5 years for allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation
- Requires planning expertise

Capital requirement: Low for option (£5k-£50k), patient capital

Example Filters:

Edge of Settlement (Preset #18):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Private owner ownership
3. 1,000-8,000 sqmt
4. Less than 5% area developed
5. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no activity)
6. No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
7. 1-10% built up area coverage (edge location)
8. More than 80% un-constrained

Un-Allocated No SHLAA (Preset #85):
1. NOT SHLAA positive/neutral/negative (not assessed!)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m of settlement boundary
4. Company or private owner
5. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)

Strategy:
1. Identify edge-of-settlement sites
2. Secure option agreement (low capital)
3. Promote to local authority (planning consultancy)
4. Get allocated in local plan
5. Apply for planning permission
6. Exit to housebuilder

Related: Presets #13, #18, #85, #86
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "SHLAA Status", "No latest sold date"

- Exit to housebuilder at planning stage

Strategy:
1. Identify emerging allocations with no planning
2. Secure option agreement with landowner
3. Apply for planning (first in)
4. Sell to housebuilder with consent

Example Filter (Preset #38):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Housing allocation (emerging)
3. Less than 1 max dwellings applied for
4. 4,000-40,000 sqmt

# ADVANCED WORKFLOW

_This section contains meta-strategies that sit on top of the filter patterns._

## ⭐ HIGHEST ROI STRATEGY (Per Stage 2 Review)

**Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage)** has been relocated to this Advanced Workflow section because it is a **workflow process** rather than a filter pattern. However, peer reviews confirm it is **one of the HIGHEST ROI strategies**:

- **Grok (Stage 2):** Ranked #1 - "Force multiplier that converts SearchLand's 24-hour refresh into unique deal flow"
- **Codex (Stage 1):** Ranked #3 - "High ROI, needs tooling but strategic advantage"
- **Gemini (Stage 1):** Ranked #2 - "Brilliant concept, A-grade strategic value"

**Strategic Philosophy Difference:**
- **Speed/Timing Lens (Grok):** Time arbitrage = highest priority (be first to act)
- **Certainty Lens (Gemini/Codex):** Regulation-driven = highest priority (predictable triggers)
- **Both valid:** Choose based on your competitive advantage (speed vs. process)

**What Makes This Different:**
This is a **FORCE MULTIPLIER** - it doesn't replace other patterns, it amplifies them. Apply this workflow to ANY pattern you choose (Regulation, Motivated Seller, Planning, etc.) to gain a 24-hour speed advantage over competition.

---

## 13. Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies ⭐ NEW

**Core Concept:** SearchLand refreshes data every 24 hours. Speed advantage = profit advantage.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)
- Time arbitrage = price arbitrage
```

### Pattern 13B: Fresh Planning Consent Alert
```
Strategy: Contact owner same day planning consent granted
Indicators:
- Planning status: Approved (filter)
- Decision date: Last 7 days (custom monitoring)
- Your action: Call owner immediately

Example Script:
"Congratulations on your consent. I have a buyer ready to move. 
Would £580k interest you?" (Owner unaware of £650k market value)

Profit: £70k in 48 hours (user example)

Strengths: Maximum information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires daily monitoring, fast response capability
Capital: Option agreement or cash purchase ready
```

### Pattern 13C: Lease Expiry Pre-Contact (90-Day Window)
```
Strategy: Contact owner 90 days before lease expiry (before void period)
Indicators:
- Lease end date: 60-120 days from today
- Use class: Commercial (E, B2, B8)
- Your offer: "Avoid void period, we have buyers ready"

Owner Psychology:
- 90 days out: Starting to worry about vacancy
- 30 days out: Panicking about lost income
- Post-expiry: Maximum pressure (carrying costs, no income)

Profit Source: Buy at "pre-panic" price, sell at market
```

### Pattern 13D: New Allocation Alert (Local Plan)
```
Strategy: Contact owner when site added to local plan allocations
Indicators:
- Housing allocation: Emerging (NEW)
- Applications in last 5 years: 0 (owner unaware)
- Your action: "Your site just got allocated—let's discuss before agent calls"

Example:
Day 1: SearchLand shows site added to emerging allocations
Day 1 (same day): You call owner offering £300k
Owner thinks: "My land was worth £150k yesterday, £300k is amazing!"
Reality: Market value post-allocation = £500k
Your profit: £200k by being first

Strengths: Massive information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires immediate action (speed critical)
```

### Pattern 13E: Fast Food Lease Expiry (High Visibility)
```
Strategy: Target high-footfall commercial with expiring leases
Indicators:
- Use class: E (restaurants/retail)
- Lease end date: Last 30 days (just expired)
- Footfall count: >2000/day (high value)
- Your action: Contact landlord (now in void period, cash flow pressure)

Why This Works:
- High footfall = high value but landlord may not realize
- Void period = immediate cash flow pressure
- Can offer "quick sale to avoid prolonged void"

Buyers: Fast food chains, convenience stores (high footfall valuable)
```

### Implementation Requirements

**System Setup:**
1. **Daily Automated Exports**
   - Export target filter results as CSV/JSON
   - Store with timestamp
   - Compare today vs yesterday (diff script)

2. **Alert Triggers**
   - New properties added: Email notification
   - Status changes: SMS + Email
   - Approaching thresholds (e.g., 90 days to lease expiry): Weekly digest

3. **Response Protocol**
   - Same-day contact for fresh consents
   - Script templates for different scenarios
   - Cash/option ready to move fast

**Tools Needed:**
- SearchLand API (or automated export)
- Diff comparison script (Python/Node)
- Email/SMS alerting system
- CRM for tracking contacts

### Capital Strategy

**Speed Capital:**
- Keep £50k-£200k liquid for immediate deployment
- Option agreements (£10k-£50k) for fast control
- Bridging finance arranged in advance (no delays)

**Profit Model:**
- Time arbitrage: Buy at "uninformed" price, sell at "informed" price
- Typical spread: 10-30% (£50k-£200k on £500k deal)
- Volume strategy: 10-20 deals/year = £500k-£2M profit

### Strengths
1. **Information asymmetry:** You know before owner/market
2. **No competition:** Pre-market, no agents, no bidders
3. **Premium pricing:** Buyers pay for exclusivity
4. **Scalable:** Automated monitoring, repeatable process
5. **High ROI:** Low capital, high profit margins

### Weaknesses
1. **Requires daily monitoring:** Labor-intensive or requires automation
2. **Speed critical:** Miss by 1 day = opportunity lost
3. **Competitive advantage erodes:** Once others adopt same strategy
4. **SearchLand dependency:** 24hr refresh only (not real-time)
5. **Execution risk:** Owner may not want to sell, buyer may back out

### Example Deal Flow

**Day 1 Morning:**
- SearchLand export shows planning consent granted yesterday
- Property: 4-unit scheme, Camden, owner-occupied

**Day 1 Afternoon:**
- Call owner: "Congratulations! I have a buyer at £580k, quick completion"
- Owner (unaware of £650k market value): "Yes, that sounds great!"

**Day 2:**
- Option agreement signed (£10k, 30-day exercise)
- Call buyer network: "Fresh consent, Camden, 4 units, £650k"
- Buyer: "Pre-vetted, no competition? Yes."

**Day 3-30:**
- Due diligence, legal, exercise option
- Completion: You buy £580k, sell £650k
- **Net profit: £60k** (after legals/costs)

**Annualized: 10 deals = £600k profit from speed arbitrage alone**

---

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### ❌ Over-Constraining
```
Problem: Combining too many restrictive filters
Example: Applications = 0 AND Price <£200k AND Derelict AND On-market AND PTAL 6a
Result: 0 results (filters compound restrictiveness)
Solution: Test incrementally, use separate filter groups for different approaches
```

### ❌ Geographic Mismatches
```
Problem: Using London-specific filters (PTAL) for UK-wide searches
Example: PTAL filter outside TfL area
Result: 0 results
Solution: Create separate approaches for London vs rest of UK
```

### ❌ Assuming Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem: Designing strategy around filters that don't exist
Example: "Planning Status: Expired" or "Price Reduced"
Result: Cannot implement strategy
Solution: Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md first
```

## 22. HMO Conversion Strategies ⭐ NEW (Stage 2 - Gemini + Grok)

**Added based on Stage 2 peer review - both Gemini and Grok independently suggested this pattern**

### Pattern 22A: University/Hospital Proximity HMO
```
Strategy: Target properties suitable for HMO conversion near education/healthcare demand
Source: Derived from regulation-driven patterns + market analysis
Proposed by: Gemini + Grok (Stage 2 consensus)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Existing Use Class: C3 (residential dwelling)
2. Title area (sqm): is greater than 100 AND less than 300
3. Distance to nearest university: less than 1000m
   OR Distance to nearest hospital: less than 1000m
4. Sales listing price: is less than £400,000
5. NOT: Article 4 direction HMO areas (manual check required)
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- Existing C3 residential (avoids commercial complications)
- Size: 100-300 sqm (adequate for 4-6 bedrooms)
- Proximity: <1km to university/hospital (tenant demand)
- Capital: <£400k (allows £50k-£100k conversion costs)
- Freehold: Easier to convert than leasehold

Strategic Rationale:
- Strong rental yields: 5-8% vs. 3-4% standard BTL
- Planning permission often not required (if <7 occupants, no Article 4)
- Professional tenant base (students/NHS staff)
- Lower voids due to institutional demand

Strengths:
- Higher yields than standard residential
- Established demand (universities/hospitals don't relocate)
- Can often convert without planning (check local policy)
- Exit strategy: Hold for yield OR sell to HMO operator

Weaknesses:
- Management intensive (multiple tenants, higher turnover)
- Licensing required in some areas (check LPA HMO licensing)
- Article 4 directions restrict conversions in some zones
- Fire safety/building regs more stringent

Capital requirement:
- Acquisition: £150k-£400k
- Conversion: £50k-£100k (bedrooms, ensuites, fire doors, certification)
- Licensing/legals: £5k-£15k
- Total: £205k-£515k

Planning Check:
- Confirm no Article 4 direction for HMOs in area
- Check if area is "cumulative impact zone" (HMO saturation)
- Verify local HMO licensing requirements
- <7 occupants usually permitted development (sui generis not required)

Exit Strategy:
1. Hold for rental income (5-8% yield)
2. Sell to HMO portfolio investor (premium vs. C3)
3. Convert back to C3 if market changes
```

### Pattern 22B: Transport Hub HMO
```
Strategy: HMO conversion targeting young professionals near transport
Source: User strategy (Stage 2 addition)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Existing Use Class: C3 (residential)
2. Title area (sqm): is greater than 120 AND less than 250
3. Distance to nearest Train Station: less than 500m
4. PTAL: 4, 5, 6a, or 6b (London only - OR use train station proxy)
5. Sales listing price: is less than £500,000
6. Freehold tenure

Indicators:
- C3 residential baseline
- 120-250 sqm (5-6 bedroom potential)
- <500m train station (commuter appeal)
- High PTAL or transport links
- Freehold preferred

Strategic Rationale:
- Young professional market (stable, higher income)
- Transport proximity = premium rents
- Lower management burden than student HMOs
- Strong capital appreciation in transport zones

Capital requirement:
- Acquisition: £250k-£500k
- Conversion: £60k-£120k
- Total: £310k-£620k
```

## 23. Unbroken Freehold Titles ⭐ NEW (Stage 2 - Gemini + Codex)

**Added based on Stage 2 peer review - both Gemini and Codex highlighted title assembly risk**

### Pattern 23A: Single-Title Large Parcels
```
Strategy: Target large development sites held as single freehold title (no assembly risk)
Source: SearchLand Preset #69 + reviewer insight
Proposed by: Gemini + Codex (Stage 2 consensus)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Freehold tenure: Yes
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 2 AND less than 20
3. Less than 10% area developed (development potential)
4. Ownership type: Private owner OR Company (single negotiation)
5. NOT: Multiple ownerships on site (manual title check)
6. NOT: Ransom strips (manual diligence)

Indicators:
- Freehold: Full control, no lease complications
- Single title: Ideally one title number (check Land Registry)
- Large parcel: 2-20 acres (meaningful development)
- Low development: <10% built (greenfield/brownfield opportunity)
- Single owner: One negotiation vs. multiple landowners

Strategic Rationale:
- **Assembly Risk Elimination:** No ransom strips, access disputes, or holdouts
- **Planning Simplification:** Single title = simpler red line boundary
- **Negotiation Efficiency:** One owner, one deal, one legal process
- **Exit Certainty:** Clean title = easier to sell to housebuilder

Strengths:
- No title assembly complexity (major risk reduction)
- Single negotiation (faster, lower legal costs)
- Planning applications simpler (no multi-owner complications)
- Housebuilders pay premium for clean title

Weaknesses:
- Single large parcels rarer than fragmented sites
- Owner knows site value (less negotiation leverage)
- Higher capital requirement (buying entire parcel)

Capital requirement:
- Varies by site: £500k-£10M+ (often institutional)
- Option agreements possible: £50k-£200k (secure site, lower upfront)
- Consider JV with housebuilder (reduces capital requirement)

Due Diligence Critical:
1. **Title check:** Verify single title number (Land Registry search)
2. **Access:** Confirm no ransom strips or third-party access requirements
3. **Easements:** Check for restrictive covenants or utility easements
4. **Boundaries:** Verify no boundary disputes with neighbors
5. **Planning history:** Check for previous applications/refusals

Strategy:
1. Filter for large freehold parcels
2. Verify single title via Land Registry
3. Check access (no ransom strips)
4. Assess planning potential
5. Negotiate direct OR secure option
6. Exit to housebuilder with planning or at land stage
```

### Pattern 23B: No Lease Complications
```
Strategy: Freehold sites avoiding leasehold complexities
Source: User strategy (Stage 2 addition)

Example SearchLand Query:
1. Freehold tenure: Yes
2. NOT: Leasehold interests on site
3. NOT: Ground rent obligations
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5
5. Ownership type: Private owner (direct negotiation)

Indicators:
- Pure freehold (no leasehold layers)
- No ground rent complications
- No lease expiry issues
- Direct ownership path

Strategic Rationale:
- Leasehold can complicate planning/development
- Freeholder consent often required
- Ground rent obligations reduce value
- Simpler exit to developers

Strengths: Clean ownership, lower legal costs, easier financing
Weaknesses: May miss some opportunities (some leaseholds are viable)
Capital requirement: Varies by site size
```
