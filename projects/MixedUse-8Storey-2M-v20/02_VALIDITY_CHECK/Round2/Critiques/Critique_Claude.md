---

## **DETAILED APPROACH VALIDATIONS**

---

### **Claude - Approach A: High-Density Mixed-Use Precedent**
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (Filter corrections required)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ❌ **Filter doesn't exist:** `Development Type: contains "Mixed Use"`
   - **Evidence:** Not in `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`
   - **3/4 LLM consensus:** Claude, Gemini, Grok agree it doesn't exist
2. ✅ All other filters valid
3. ✅ Unit usage correct (acres, metres)

**Suggested Fixes:**
```
REMOVE:
❌ Development Type: contains "Mixed Use"

ADD:
✅ Proposal: contains "mixed use" OR "mixed-use"
✅ Proposal: contains "retail"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £180k total - ✅ WITHIN BUDGET
- **ROI Target:** £2M-£4M from precedent replication - ✅ VALID (user requested precedent-based, auto-valid per instructions)
- **Structure:** Option agreements - ✅ SOUND
- **Implementation:** Viable with filter corrections

**Strategic Notes:**
- Strong precedent alignment (Slough 8-storey)
- Once filter corrected, highly executable

---

### **Claude - Approach B: Article 4 Direction Expiry**
**Status:** ❌ **INVALID** (Multiple critical failures)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ❌ **Filter doesn't exist:** `Article 4 expiry date`
   - **Evidence:** `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` only shows `Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions`
   - **No expiry date filter available**
2. ❌ **Fatal flaw:** Even if filter existed, Article 4 restrictions are LOCAL AUTHORITY decisions - expiry dates are not systematically tracked in SearchLand

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital feasibility:** ❌ **INVALID**
  - Strategy requires acquiring 3 office buildings at £200/sqft
  - Example: 5,000 sqft building = £1M purchase price
  - 3 buildings = £3M+ acquisition cost
  - **Even with options:** £50k-£100k per building × 3 = £150k-£300k (exceeds budget)
  - **Conversion costs:** £50-£100/sqft × 15,000 sqft = £750k-£1.5M
  - **Total capital required:** £900k-£1.8M - **FAR EXCEEDS £200k**

- **Codex's critique validated:** This approach cannot be executed within £200k capital

**Verdict:** ❌ **INVALID** - Both technical (no filter) and business case (capital requirement) fail

---

### **Claude - Approach C: Stalled Planning + Fresh Option**
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (Filter naming corrections needed)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ⚠️ **Minor naming precision:** Uses abbreviated filter names vs full names
   - Example: References "Max building height" vs exact "Max building height on title (m)"
   - **Impact:** Low - SearchLand AI likely parses both
2. ✅ All filters exist
3. ✅ Syntax correct
4. ✅ Units correct

**Suggested Fixes:**
```
PRECISION IMPROVEMENTS:
- Use full filter names from AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- "Max building height on title (m)" (not abbreviated)
- "Number of addresses" (not "addresses on title")
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £190k - ✅ WITHIN BUDGET
- **ROI:** £2.17M from stalled planning arbitrage - ✅ FEASIBLE
  - Strategy: Buy planning-approved sites with motivated sellers
  - Value uplift already derisked (planning approved)
  - Realistic profit path
- **Structure:** Options + acquisition - ✅ SOUND

**Strategic Notes:**
- Solid time arbitrage strategy
- Minor filter naming corrections don't affect viability

---

### **Claude - Approach D: PDR - Light Industrial to Resi**
**Status:** ❌ **INVALID** (Legal premise failure)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ❌ **FATAL LEGAL ERROR:** Class MA PDR does NOT apply to B2 (General Industrial)
   - **Evidence:** Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015
   - **Class MA covers:** Former B1(a-c) offices/light industrial → NOW Class E(g)
   - **B2 (General Industrial):** Requires FULL PLANNING PERMISSION for residential conversion
   - **No PDR route exists**

2. ✅ Filters themselves are valid (but strategy is not)

**Gemini's critique validated:** Planning law research confirms B2 has no PDR to C3

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Premise failure:** Strategy relies on non-existent PDR rights
- **Even if corrected to E(g)(iii):** Would need complete strategy restructuring

**Suggested Fix (Major Restructure Required):**
```
MUST CHANGE:
❌ Remove: Target B2 (General Industrial)
✅ Add: Target E(g)(iii) (Light Industrial within Class E)
✅ Add: Verify 2-year continuous use requirement
✅ Rewrite entire strategy around correct PDR eligibility
```

**Verdict:** ❌ **INVALID** - Cannot work as written. Requires fundamental restructuring.

---

### **Claude - Approach E: Green Belt Exception Sites**
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (Filter substitution + partnership dependency)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ⚠️ **No direct "agricultural value" filter**
   - **Workaround:** Use `Agricultural land classification` as proxy
   - **Feasible:** Grade 3b/4/5 land correlates with lower agricultural value
2. ✅ All other filters exist
3. ✅ Strategy technically sound

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £60k-£80k per site - ✅ WITHIN BUDGET (2-3 sites possible)
- **ROI:** £2.27M - ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL on Housing Association partnership**
  - **Critical dependency:** Requires HA to deliver affordable units
  - **Not self-executable:** Cannot develop alone with £200k capital
  - **Exit route:** Profit from cross-subsidy market units OR sell consented site to HA/developer

**Partnership Risk:**
- ✅ Strategy is valid IF partnerships secured
- ⚠️ Execution depends on third-party cooperation (not fully in your control)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Innovative niche strategy
- Higher execution complexity than other approaches

---

### **Codex - Approach A: Slough 8-Storey Precedent Match**
**Status:** ❌ **INVALID** (Critical filters don't exist)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ❌ **Filter doesn't exist:** `Decision: is one of Approved`
   - **Evidence:** NOT in `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`
   - **3/4 LLM consensus:** Claude, Gemini, Grok confirm it doesn't exist
   - **Codex's claim:** "Filter exists" - ❌ **FACTUALLY INCORRECT**

2. ❌ **Filter doesn't exist:** `Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough`
   - **Evidence:** NOT in `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`
   - **Available alternative:** `Neighbouring Local Planning Authorities of` (requires manual selection)

3. ✅ Other filters valid

**Suggested Fixes:**
```
REMOVE:
❌ Decision: is one of Approved
❌ Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough

ADD:
✅ Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01
✅ Proposal: contains "approved" OR "permission granted"
✅ Neighbouring Local Planning Authorities of: [manual selection including Slough]
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Once corrected:** Capital feasible (£180k), ROI valid (precedent-based)
- **As written:** ❌ **UNEXECUTABLE** - filters will fail

**Verdict:** ❌ **INVALID** as written - Must use proxy filters before deployment

---

### **Codex - Approach B: Sub-£200k Mixed-Use Footfall Edge**
**Status:** ❌ **INVALID** (Syntax error)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ❌ **INVALID SYNTAX:** `Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"`
   - **Evidence:** `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` states: "SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line"
   - **Enum fields require:** `is one of` operator, not `contains`
   - **Gemini + Grok consensus:** This syntax will fail

**Suggested Fixes:**
```
REMOVE:
❌ Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"

ADD:
✅ Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Mixed Use", "Sui Generis"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £200k - ✅ EXACTLY AT BUDGET
- **ROI:** Viable (low-cost entry + PD/intensification upside)
- **Structure:** Sound

**Verdict:** ❌ **INVALID** syntax as written - Easy fix, strategy remains sound

---

### **Codex - Approach C: Distressed Company Mixed-Use Sites**
**Status:** ❌ **INVALID** (Syntax error - same issue as Approach B)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ❌ **INVALID SYNTAX:** `Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"`
   - **Same error as Approach B**
   - **SearchLand doesn't support OR within single line**

2. ✅ **Excellent use of motivation signal:** `Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration`
   - **Confirmed valid:** `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` documents this filter
   - **Strong strategy:** Liquidation = forced sale = high motivation

**Suggested Fixes:**
```
REMOVE:
❌ Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"

ADD:
✅ Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Mixed Use"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £190k - ✅ WITHIN BUDGET
- **ROI:** ⚠️ See separate analysis below
- **Structure:** Option/deposit approach - ✅ SOUND

**ROI Analysis:**
- **Gemini's concern validated:** £150k distressed purchase → £2M profit requires significant development
- **Realistic profit paths:**
  - **Planning gain only:** £150k → £450k consented = **£300k profit** ✅ ACHIEVABLE
  - **Planning + light refurb (£50k):** £150k → £600k = **£450k profit** ✅ ACHIEVABLE
  - **Full build-out to £2M GDV:** Requires £800k-£1.5M construction = ❌ **EXCEEDS BUDGET**

**Revised Business Case:**
- **Reduce ROI target to £300k-£500k** (planning gain strategy)
- **Approach is VALID for £300k-£500k profit, NOT £2M**

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Fix syntax + adjust ROI expectations to £300k-£500k

---

### **Gemini - Approach A: High-Density Intensification via Option**
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
1. ✅ All filters exist
2. ✅ Syntax correct
3. ✅ Units correct (acres, metres)
4. ✅ Logical filter combinations

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £65k - ✅ WELL WITHIN BUDGET
- **ROI:** £2M+ from intensification - ✅ FEASIBLE (precedent-based approach)
- **Structure:** Option agreement - ✅ SOUND
- **Conservative deployment:** Low capital risk, high upside

**Strategic Notes:**
- Well-structured, conservative approach
- Excellent use of option strategy
- No technical or business case issues

**Verdict:** ✅ **FULLY VALID** - Production ready

---

### **Gemini - Approach B: Opportunistic Liquidation Acquisition**
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (ROI expectations + SDLT error)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ⚠️ **SDLT calculation error:**
   - **Listed:** £2,400 SDLT on £145k commercial property
   - **Correct:** £2,900 (£145k × 2% first £250k band for non-residential)
   - **Minor error:** Doesn't affect viability

2. ✅ All filters exist and valid
3. ✅ Excellent use of `Company status: Liquidation` motivation signal

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £185k - ✅ WITHIN BUDGET
- **ROI Target:** £2M - ⚠️ **UNREALISTIC** within £200k capital

**ROI Reality Check:**
```
Scenario: £145k acquisition + £55k costs = £200k total

PATH 1 - Planning Gain Only:
- Current: £145k (distressed)
- Post-consent: £450k (residential planning)
- Profit: £305k ✅ ACHIEVABLE

PATH 2 - Planning + Light Works:
- Add: £50k refurb (light touch)
- Post-work: £600k
- Profit: £455k ✅ ACHIEVABLE

PATH 3 - Full Development to £2M GDV:
- Build costs: £800k-£1.5M
- Requires external finance ❌ EXCEEDS BUDGET
```

**Codex's critique validated:** £2M ROI requires build-out capital far exceeding £200k

**Gemini's clarification noted:** Strategy is planning-gain focused (sell consented site), not build-out

**Revised Assessment:**
- **Realistic ROI:** £300k-£500k (planning gain + light works)
- **£2M only achievable with external development finance**

**Suggested Fix:**
- **Revise ROI target to £300k-£500k**
- **Clarify exit strategy:** Sell consented site to developer (not build-out)

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Valid strategy, but ROI expectations must be £300k-£500k, not £2M

---

### **Grok - Approach A: High-Density Intensification Precedent**
**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (Filter logic contradiction)

**Technical Issues:**
1. ⚠️ **Logical contradiction:**
   - **Filter 1:** `Max building height on title (m): is less than 15` (4-5 storeys max)
   - **Filter 2:** `Proposal: contains "storey"` (any storey count)
   - **Strategy goal:** Target 8-storey intensification potential
   - **Problem:** Height filter excludes sites with existing tall buildings, but doesn't guarantee low-rise → may return mix of heights

2. ✅ All filters exist
3. ✅ Syntax correct

**Suggested Fix:**
```
CLARIFY INTENT:
If targeting LOW-RISE for intensification:
✅ Max building height on title (m): is less than 12 (ensures 3-4 storey max)
✅ Remove: Proposal: contains "storey" (adds noise)
✅ Add: Max number of building floors on title: is less than 5

If targeting EXISTING tall proposals:
✅ Remove: Max building height < 15
✅ Add: Proposal: contains "8-storey" OR "multi-storey"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £100k-£200k - ✅ WITHIN BUDGET
- **ROI:** Viable (precedent-based)
- **Structure:** Sound

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Resolve filter logic contradiction before deployment

---

### **Grok - Approach B: Permitted Development Rights Conversion**
**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**
1. ✅ All filters exist
2. ✅ Excellent use of negative filters (NOT Flood Zone, NOT AONB, etc.)
3. ✅ Correct PDR eligibility criteria (Class E, size limits, exclusions)
4. ✅ Syntax correct
5. ✅ Units correct (acres, sqft)

**Business Case Assessment:**
- **Capital:** £100k-£200k - ✅ WITHIN BUDGET
- **ROI:** £3M-£4M from PDR conversions - ✅ FEASIBLE
  - **PDR removes planning risk**
  - **Value uplift:** Commercial £100-£150/sqft → Residential £300-£500/sqft
  - **SearchLand calculates profit automatically for Class MA**
- **Structure:** Direct purchase or option - ✅ SOUND

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent technical execution
- Properly excludes all PDR restrictions
- Conservative capital deployment
- No issues identified

**Verdict:** ✅ **FULLY VALID** - Production ready

---

## **STRATEGIC DIVERSITY ASSESSMENT**

### ✅ **Diversity Achieved Across Patterns:**

1. **Precedent-based:** Claude A, Codex A (both need fixes)
2. **Capital-efficient:** Gemini A (option), all approaches attempt this
3. **Motivation-driven:** Codex C (liquidation), Gemini B (liquidation)
4. **Regulation-driven:** Claude B (Article 4 - INVALID), Claude D (PDR - INVALID on B2)
5. **Time arbitrage:** Claude C (stalled planning)
6. **Niche opportunities:** Claude E (Green Belt exception), Grok B (PDR - VALID)

### ⚠️ **Pattern Gaps:**
- **Article 4 strategies:** Claude B attempted but INVALID (no filter + capital infeasible)
- **Industrial PDR:** Claude D attempted but INVALID (B2 has no PDR)
- **Regulation-driven:** Only 1 valid approach (Grok B - PDR on Class E)

   - **Verdict:** Must rewrite with proxy filters (Last application date + Proposal keywords)

4. **Codex B** - Sub-£200k Mixed-Use
   - **Issue:** OR syntax invalid
   - **Verdict:** Easy fix, but reclassified as CONDITIONAL (fix required before deployment)
   - **Update:** Move to CONDITIONAL after syntax fix

---

## **KEY VALIDATION INSIGHTS**

### **Critical Discoveries:**

1. **Filter Existence is EVERYTHING:**
   - 3 approaches (Codex A, Claude B, Claude A) relied on non-existent filters
   - **Always verify against `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`**

2. **Planning Law Must Be Verified:**
   - Claude D's B2 → PDR error shows assumption risk
   - **Always verify legal premise independently**

3. **OR Syntax NOT Supported:**
   - 2 Codex approaches (B, C) used invalid OR syntax
   - **Use `is one of` for enums, separate filters for OR logic**

4. **Capital Feasibility ≠ ROI Aspiration:**
   - £2M ROI target is fine as goal
   - £210k when budget is £200k = hard constraint violation
   - **Always model full capital requirement, not just option fees**

5. **3:1 Consensus = Definitive:**
   - When 3/4 LLMs agree filter doesn't exist → it doesn't exist
   - **Majority consensus overrides minority claims**

---

## **EXECUTION PRIORITY**

### **Tier 1: Deploy First (Highest Confidence):**
1. Gemini A - Intensification Option (✅ VALID, £65k, low risk)
2. Grok B - PDR Conversion (✅ VALID, £100k-£200k, proven model)

### **Tier 2: Quick Fixes, Deploy Next:**
3. Claude A - Precedent (5-min filter fix)
4. Codex B - Sub-£200k (5-min syntax fix - UPDATE: Move to CONDITIONAL)
5. Claude C - Stalled Planning (2-min naming fix)

### **Tier 3: Deploy with Adjusted Expectations:**
6. Codex C - Distressed (fix syntax + reduce ROI to £300k-£500k)
7. Gemini B - Liquidation (reduce ROI to £300k-£500k)

### **Tier 4: Requires More Work:**
8. Grok A - Intensification (resolve filter logic)
9. Claude E - Green Belt (HA partnerships required)

### **Do Not Deploy:**
10. Claude B - Article 4 (❌ INVALID - capital infeasible)
11. Claude D - PDR B2 (❌ INVALID - legal error)
12. Codex A - Slough (❌ INVALID - filters don't exist)

---

**Validation Complete: 2025-01-19**  
**Validated By:** Claude (Round 2 - Post-Disagreement Analysis)  
**Status:** 2 VALID, 6 CONDITIONAL (fixable), 4 INVALID  
**Recommendation:** Deploy Tier 1 immediately, fix Tier 2 within 1 hour, adjust expectations for Tier 3
