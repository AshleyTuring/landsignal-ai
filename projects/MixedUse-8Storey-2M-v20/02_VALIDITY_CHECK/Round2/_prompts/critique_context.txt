## ALL APPROACHES TO REVIEW (Original Generation)

### Claude_Approaches

# Property Search Strategy Generation - Complete

I've generated **5 comprehensive, strategically diverse approaches** that meet all your requirements. Here's what I delivered:

---

## ✅ Requirements Met

### 1. **Precedent-Based Strategy (Mandatory)**
**Approach A: High-Density Mixed-Use Precedent Replication**
- Directly targets properties similar to the Slough 8-storey mixed-use approval
- Filters for: 6+ storeys, mixed retail/residential, strong transport links (PTAL 3+, <800m stations)
- Expected: 15-30 properties
- **Profit path:** £2M-£4M from 2-3 optioned sites

### 2. **Strategic Diversity Achieved (4 Non-Precedent Approaches)**

**Approach B: Article 4 Direction Expiry - Office to Resi**
- **Pattern:** Regulation-driven opportunities
- **Strategy:** Target offices in Article 4 areas (PDR currently blocked) where restrictions are expiring
- **Capital arbitrage:** Buy at office value (£200/sqft) → Convert to residential (£450/sqft) when Article 4 lifts
- **Profit path:** £2.8M from 3 buildings

**Approach C: Stalled Planning + Fresh Option Arbitrage**
- **Pattern:** Time arbitrage (information asymmetry)
- **Strategy:** Target 2022-2023 planning approvals that remain unimplemented (finance/timing issues)
- **Advantage:** Planning derisked, motivated sellers, immediate implementation possible
- **Profit path:** £2.17M from 3 sites

**Approach D: Permitted Development - Light Industrial to Resi**
- **Pattern:** Niche opportunities (Class MA PDR)
- **Strategy:** Convert B1c/B2 industrial buildings to residential using PDR (no planning needed)
- **Value uplift:** Industrial £100-£150/sqft → Residential £300-£500/sqft
- **Profit path:** £3M-£4M from 4 buildings

**Approach E: Green Belt Exception Sites - Community-Led Housing**
- **Pattern:** Community partnerships (exception site policy)
- **Strategy:** Deliver affordable housing on Green Belt land via Housing Association partnerships
- **Low capital:** Acquire at agricultural value (£10k-£20k/acre), profit from cross-subsidy market units
- **Profit path:** £2.27M from 1-2 schemes

---

## 📊 Strategic Diversity Matrix

| Category | Approaches | Strategic Angle |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Precedent-based** | A | Similar planning approvals (user requirement) |
| **Capital-efficient** | All approaches | Option agreements maximize £200k leverage |
| **Regulation-driven** | B, D | Article 4 expiry, PDR rights |
| **Time/information arbitrage** | C | Stalled planning, motivated sellers |
| **Niche opportunities** | D, E | PDR conversion, community-led |

---

## 🎯 How Each Approach Achieves £2M Profit on £200k Capital

### Common Capital-Efficient Structure:
All approaches use **option agreements** rather than outright purchase:
- **Option fee:** £5k-£20k per site (controls property without buying)
- **Exercise price:** Current use value (paid only when planning/PDR secured)
- **Your capital outlay:** £50k-£200k total across 3-6 sites
- **Profit mechanism:** Value uplift from planning/conversion - option exercise price

### Profit Examples:

**Approach A (Precedent):**
- Option 3 sites @ £15k each = £45k
- Site 1: £800k current value → £2.5M with 8-storey consent = **£1.5M profit**
- Site 2: Similar = **£1.5M profit**
- **Total: £3M**

**Approach D (Industrial PDR):**
- Option 6 buildings @ £15k each = £90k
- Building 1: £1.8M industrial → £3.5M with residential PDR = **£1.67M profit**
- 4 successful conversions × £1M average = **£4M total**

---

## 🔍 Filter Format - Ready for SearchLand

Each approach includes **copy-paste ready SearchLand AI prompts** in the required structured format:

### Codex_Approaches

## Approach A: Slough 8-Storey Precedent Match

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (precedent-led)  
**Capital Required:** £25k option + £35k planning pack + £60k surveys/fees + £60k JV/legal/holding = **£180k**  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough
2. Decision: is one of Approved
3. Proposal: contains "mixed use"
4. Proposal: contains "retail"
5. Proposal: contains "residential"
6. Max building height (m): is greater than 18 AND less than 30
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.6
9. Conservation area: is not within
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 3
```

**Rationale:** Targets already-approved mixed-use schemes with comparable height/mass in Slough, near rail to support 8-storey density; small-mid plots (0.15-0.6 acres) mirror urban parcels; low recent activity = potential to re-engage stalled owners. Pattern 5 leverages proven local precedent to de-risk planning.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent alignment to the 8-storey brief
- Approved status lowers planning risk
- Rail proximity supports height/mix arguments
- Tight plot band yields narrow, reviewable set
- Excludes conservation constraints

**Limitations:**
- Small supply; may cluster around few streets
- Height filter may exclude flexible massing options
- Approved schemes may have higher pricing expectations
- Limited to Slough LPA; no wider comps

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Pull shortlist from results; inspect decision notices for conditions/Section 106
- Contact owners/agents; propose option/JV citing comparable approval
- Refresh design for viability (NIA uplift, unit mix, retail sizing)
- Pre-app to validate any amendments; aim for minor material change
- Secure build cost updates; rebase GDV on latest sales

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option fee: £20k-£30k
- Planning/design/supporting studies: £30k-£40k
- Surveys (GIA, topo, UXO, transport): £20k-£30k
- Legals, SPV, CIL review, holding: £50k-£70k
- **Total:** ~£180k (within £200k)


## Approach B: Sub-£200k Mixed-Use Footfall Edge (Non-Precedent, Low-Cap Entry)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 4A: Sub-£200k Direct Purchase + Motivated Seller signal  
**Capital Required:** £150k purchase + £20k legals/surveys + £20k planning prep + £10k contingency = **£200k**  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Sales listing price: is less than £200,000
2. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
3. Tenure: Freehold
4. Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"
5. Building on title is inactive: Yes
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
8. Developed area percentage: is less than 40
9. Flood zone 2: is not within AND Flood zone 3: is not within
10. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Combines low-ticket on-market assets with inactivity (motivation) near rail for resale/PD/intensification upside; small plot, low coverage supports adding resi above/beside. Fits cash+light works within £200k.

**Strengths:**
- Hard price cap aligns to capital
- Inactivity boosts negotiation leverage
- Rail proximity drives exit values
- Low site coverage = buildable slack
- On-market data enables quick offers

**Limitations:**
- Competition for cheap listings
- Condition risk if derelict/inactive
- PD applicability varies by use/sub-type
- Smaller plots limit scale of uplift

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Rapid desktop DCF on each listing; verify title/leases
- Offer with short exclusivity; include planning feasibility pack
- Target PD where viable (Class MA/G/AA) or small extension
- Phase works: secure consent → refinance/flip
- Keep capex light; prioritize planning gain over heavy build

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition: up to £150k
- Legals/surveys/valuation: £10k-£15k
- Planning/architect/transport daylight: £10k-£15k
- Contingency/holding: £15k-£25k
- **Total:** ~£200k


## Approach C: Distressed Company Mixed-Use Sites Near Stations (Non-Precedent, Motivation-Led)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D: Liquidation/Administration Sales  
**Capital Required:** £80k option/contract deposit + £40k legals/surveys + £50k planning prep + £20k contingency = **£190k**  
**Expected Results:** 5-20 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"
4. Building on title is derelict: Yes
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.7
7. Sales listing currently on the market: Yes
8. Sales listing price: is less than £400,000
9. Applications in last 5 years: is less than 2
10. Conservation area: is not within
```

**Rationale:** Liquidation/administration forces sale; mixed-use/derelict assets near transport provide repositioning upside; price ceiling plus deposit/option structure keeps cash under £200k while pursuing planning-led uplift.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation → discounted pricing
- Mixed-use derelict = clear redevelopment story
- Rail proximity supports density/value
- Small-mid plots manageable within capital/JV
- Limited competition due to distress/legal complexity

**Limitations:**
- Small pool; may be dispersed geographically
- Insolvency sales can have title/charge complications
- Timelines driven by administrators
- Dereliction may hide structural issues

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Pull insolvency list; triage by location/plot fit
- Engage administrators with proof of funds + quick conveyance
- Secure exclusivity; commission surveys fast (structural, env)
- Draft concept layout to evidence uplift; negotiate price on CapEx
- Use bridge/partner equity post-exclusivity to complete

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/deposit: £60k-£90k
- Insolvency legal/technical due diligence: £15k-£25k
- Surveys (structural/env/topo): £10k-£15k
- Planning/architect/consultants: £35k-£45k
- Contingency/holding: £15k-£25k
- **Total:** ~£190k

## Approach A: High-Density Intensification via Option Agreement

**Strategic Pattern:** Combination of Pattern 5A (High-Density/Intensification) and Pattern 4B (Low Capital Entry)
**Capital Required:** £65,000 (Option Fee + Professional Fees)
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
2. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
4. Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"
5. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2
7. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
8. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt: is equal to 0
```

**Rationale:**
This approach directly targets properties similar to the Slough precedent (8-storey mixed-use) but uses a low-capital entry strategy to fit the £200k budget. It identifies under-developed, low-rise commercial properties in transport-accessible locations, which have a strong policy basis for high-density uplift.

By combining Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) with indicators from Pattern 4B (Option Agreement Candidates) like long ownership (`Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01`) and no recent activity (`Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 2`), we target owners who may be motivated to agree to an option, avoiding a large upfront capital purchase. The search is for off-market sites to reduce competition.

**Strengths:**
- Access to high-value development opportunities with low initial capital.
- Directly mimics the precedent's core concept: replacing a low-rise building with a high-density one.
- Strong planning argument based on transport accessibility and housing need.
- Off-market approach avoids competitive bidding.
- Leverages planning gain for profit, rather than requiring large construction capital upfront.

**Limitations:**
- Success is heavily dependent on successful negotiation of an option agreement.
- Owners may not be motivated to sell or may demand a high option fee.
- Planning risk still exists; securing consent for 8 storeys is not guaranteed.
- Requires a longer timeline to realize profit (planning process + eventual sale).
- Identifying the ultimate beneficial owner for off-market sites can be time-consuming.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the SearchLand query to generate a target list.
2.  **Research:** For the top 5-10 sites, conduct desktop due diligence. Research the owner via Land Registry and Companies House.
3.  **Approach:** Contact the owner directly with a well-researched proposal for an option agreement, contingent on achieving planning permission for an 8-storey mixed-use scheme.
4.  **Secure Option:** Negotiate and sign an option agreement for a 24-36 month period, paying an option fee.
5.  **Planning:** Appoint a planning consultant and architect to prepare and submit a pre-application, followed by a full planning application.
6.  **Exit:** Once planning is granted, either sell the site with the benefit of planning to a developer or execute the option and develop the scheme (likely requiring a JV partner or development finance).

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option Fee (1-3% of estimated land value): £30,000
- Legal Fees (for option agreement): £10,000
- Initial Planning & Architectural Reports: £25,000
- **Total:** £65,000

---
## Approach B: Opportunistic Liquidation Acquisition

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)
**Capital Required:** £185,000 (Acquisition + Fees)
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation, In Administration
3. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
4. Sales listing price: is less than 150000
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
6. Use class: is not one of "C3 - Dwellinghouses"
```

**Rationale:**
This is a diverse, non-precedent-based strategy focused on extreme seller motivation. It leverages the "Company status" filter, a powerful tool identified in the LEARNINGS_DATABASE, to find assets being sold by liquidators or administrators. These are forced sales, creating an opportunity to acquire property at a significant discount to market value.

The target profit of £2M from a £200k outlay requires a high-leverage strategy; acquiring a discounted asset is a prime example. By filtering for a low price (`< £150,000`) and a decent size (`> 0.2 acres`), we target sites where the £200k capital can cover the full acquisition cost, leaving room for planning fees to add significant value. We exclude standard residential (C3) to focus on commercial or land sites with greater redevelopment potential.

**Strengths:**
- Targets sellers with the highest possible motivation (legal obligation to sell).
- High potential for below-market-value acquisition.
- Faster transaction times, as liquidators are motivated to close deals quickly.
- Reduced competition as these are specialist situations.
- Strong negotiating position for a cash-ready buyer.

**Limitations:**
- Very limited pool of available properties at any given time.
- Properties may have significant legal, structural, or contamination issues.
- The "story" behind the liquidation may be complex and require thorough due diligence.
- Competition from other distressed asset funds/investors.
- Properties are often sold "as-is," with limited warranties or guarantees.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Identify:** Run the SearchLand query. Due to the rarity of these opportunities, this search should be run frequently (daily/weekly).
2.  **Triage:** Immediately assess any matching properties. Review the agent's details and the nature of the administration/liquidation.
3.  **Due Diligence:** Act quickly. Instruct a solicitor to review the legal pack. Conduct a site visit to assess the physical condition and redevelopment potential.
4.  **Offer:** Make a clean, decisive offer, emphasizing speed and certainty of funds. Cash offers are heavily preferred.
5.  **Acquire:** Purchase the property.
6.  **Value-Add & Exit:** With the asset secured at a low base cost, there are multiple routes to profit:
    *   **Planning Gain:** Apply for planning for a higher-value use (e.g., residential, mixed-use) and sell the site on.
    *   **Refurbish & Re-let:** If a building exists, refurbish it and let it to generate income.
    *   **Flip:** If the discount was deep enough, simply re-market the property to a mainstream buyer.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition Price: £145,000
- Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) on commercial property: £2,400
- Legal & Professional Fees: £8,000
- Initial Survey/Report Costs: £5,000
- Planning Application Fee: £25,000
- **Total:** £185,400

### Grok_Approaches

### Approach A: High-Density Intensification Precedent
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
2. Proposal: contains "storey"
3. Proposal: contains "mixed-use"
4. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 5
6. Percentage of title covered by Green Belt land: is equal to 0
7. Developed area percentage: is greater than 40
```

**Rationale:**  
This approach targets low-rise buildings in accessible locations with existing planning proposals for multi-storey mixed-use developments, directly replicating the precedent of the approved 8-storey mixed-use scheme in Slough. By focusing on sites with "storey" and "mixed-use" keywords in proposals, it identifies properties with demonstrated development intent similar to the Slough approval. The pattern leverages Pattern 5A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md for intensification potential, combined with transport accessibility (via train station proximity) to ensure viability, as seen in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md insights on transport filters. Capital stays within £200k through option agreements or direct purchases of undervalued sites.

**Strengths:**
- Directly precedents the approved Slough 8-storey mixed-use development by targeting similar proposal types
- Combines motivation (existing planning interest) with development upside (low-rise to high-density conversion)
- Transport proximity adds marketability and policy support for intensification
- Narrow filter set reduces noise while targeting viable sites

**Limitations:**
- PTAL filter limited to London (not applicable to Slough), so relies on train station proxy which may include less optimal locations
- Planning approval not guaranteed despite precedent similarity
- Competition from developers targeting similar intensification opportunities
- Requires local policy research for tall building zones outside London

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify candidate sites; prioritize those with recent proposals containing "8-storey" or "mixed-use" keywords.
2. Research local planning policies in target areas (e.g., Slough or similar) for tall building support.
3. Approach owners with option agreements (£50k-£100k deposits) contingent on planning approval.
4. Secure planning permission for 8-storey mixed-use intensification.
5. Develop or sell to housebuilder at planning stage for profit realization.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option deposits: £50,000-£100,000
- Planning application fees: £20,000-£50,000
- Legal/due diligence: £10,000-£30,000
- **Total:** £80,000-£180,000 (within £200k limit, with profit from resale/development)

---

### Approach B: Permitted Development Rights Conversion
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 7A: Class MA (Commercial to Residential)  
**Capital Required:** £100,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Use class: is one of E, E(a), E(b), E(c)(i), E(c)(ii), E(c)(iii), E(d), E(e), E(f), E(g)(i), E(g)(ii), E(g)(iii)
2. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 398
3. Title area (acres): is less than 0.988
4. NOT: Use class: is equal to C3 dwellinghouses
5. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2: is greater than 0
6. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is greater than 0
7. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: is greater than 0
8. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is greater than 0
9. NOT: Percentage of title covered by Sites of Special Scientific Interest: is greater than 0
```

**Rationale:**  
This completely different strategy (not precedent-based) exploits Permitted Development Rights for Class MA conversions, allowing commercial buildings to residential without full planning. It uses Pattern 7A from FILTER_PATTERNS.md, targeting E-class commercial properties eligible for conversion, as detailed in PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md (Preset #4). Unlike the intensification approach, this focuses on regulatory arbitrage rather than replicating specific planning precedents, with capital feasibility through direct purchases or options. Profit potential comes from converting commercial space to residential units, leveraging SearchLand's built-in profit calculations for Class MA.

**Strengths:**
- PDR eliminates full planning risk and timeline (faster than traditional development)
- SearchLand calculates profit automatically for eligible sites
- Lower capital entry compared to ground-up construction
- Clear regulatory framework with proven conversion rates

**Limitations:**
- Limited to E-class commercial buildings with 2+ years of use
- Size restrictions (title <4,000 sqmt) and exclusions (flood zones, AONB, etc.) narrow pool
- Requires 2-year commercial use period (cannot convert immediately)
- Profit depends on local residential values, which vary geographically

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify Class MA-eligible commercial properties.
2. Verify 2-year commercial use and structural suitability for residential conversion.
3. Purchase or option sites (£100k-£150k) and initiate conversion works.
4. Convert to residential units and sell for profit.
5. Monitor for Article 4 directions that could restrict PDR in target areas.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Property acquisition: £80,000-£150,000
- Conversion costs (internal fit-out): £20,000-£50,000
- Legal/fees: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £110,000-£220,000 (adjust to stay within £200k, with profit from unit sales)

## **Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**

### **1. Codex - Approach A (Slough 8-Storey Precedent Match)**
**Was:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Now:** ❌ **INVALID**

**Evidence:**
- **Filter "Decision: is one of Approved" does NOT exist** (confirmed by 3/4 LLMs: Claude, Gemini, Grok)
- **Filter "Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough" does NOT exist** (confirmed by Gemini, Grok)
- **AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md** does NOT list either filter
- Available workaround: Use "Last application submitted" + "Proposal: contains 'approved'" as proxy
- **Codex's claim both filters exist is factually incorrect**

**Revised fix required:**
```
Replace non-existent filters:
❌ Remove: Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough
❌ Remove: Decision: is one of Approved

✅ Add: Neighbouring Local Planning Authorities of [manual selection including Slough]
✅ Add: Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01
✅ Add: Proposal: contains "approved" OR "permission"
```

**Business case impact:** Still viable once filters corrected, but geography must be handled differently.

---

### **2. Codex - Approaches B & C (Use class filter syntax)**
**Was:** ✅ VALID (Approach B), ✅ VALID (Approach C)  
**Now:** ❌ **INVALID** (syntax error)

**Evidence:**
- **Gemini & Grok both flag:** `Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'` is invalid syntax
- **SearchLand does NOT support OR within a single filter line** (confirmed by Grok)
- **Correct syntax:** Must use `is one of` for enum fields like Use class
- **My original validation missed this syntax error**

**Revised fix required:**
```
❌ WRONG: Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'

✅ CORRECT: Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Mixed Use", "Sui Generis"
```

**Business case impact:** Still sound, but filters must be rewritten with correct syntax before deployment.

---

### **3. Claude - Approach D (Permitted Development - Light Industrial to Resi)**
**Was:** ✅ VALID  
**Now:** ❌ **INVALID** (planning law error)

**Evidence:**
- **Gemini states:** "Permitted Development Rights (Class MA) for conversion to residential do not apply to Use Class B2"
- **Class MA PDR applies to:** Former B1(c) (now E(g)(iii) - light industrial), NOT B2 (General Industrial)
- **B2 to residential requires full planning permission** - no PDR available
- **My original validation failed to verify the legal premise**

**Planning law verification:**
- **Class MA (Commercial to Residential PDR):** Applies to offices (E(g)), light industrial (E(g)(iii)), research & development (E(g)(ii))
- **B2 (General Industrial):** NOT covered by Class MA - requires full planning permission for residential conversion
- **Result:** Entire approach premise is flawed

**Revised assessment:** This approach cannot work as structured. Would need to:
1. Change target use class from B2 to E(g)(iii) (light industrial within Class E)
2. Verify 2-year continuous use in qualifying use class
3. Ensure site meets all Class MA conditions

**Business case impact:** Invalidated unless fundamentally restructured to target E(g)(iii) instead of B2.

---

### **4. Claude - Approach B (Article 4 Direction Expiry)**
**Was:** ✅ VALID  
**Now:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (capital feasibility dispute)

**Evidence:**
- **Codex claims:** "Acquisition + conversion far beyond £200k" making approach INVALID
- **My original assessment:** "£2.8M profit from 3 buildings achievable"
- **Reality check needed:** Can this be structured within £200k total capital?

**Financial modeling:**
```
Per building (3 total):
- Option fee: £25k-£40k (2.5-5% of £800k value)
- Due diligence: £10k
- Prior approval costs: £5k
- Legal fees: £15k
TOTAL per building: £55k-£70k

3 buildings: £165k-£210k

Potential issue: £210k exceeds £200k budget by 5%
```

**Revised position:**
- **If structured with lower option fees** (2.5% = £20k): £150k total - ✅ VALID
- **If market demands 5% options** (£40k): £210k total - ❌ EXCEEDS BUDGET

**Business case impact:** CONDITIONAL on negotiating option fees at lower end of market range (2.5-3% vs 5%).

---

### **5. Gemini - Approach B (Liquidation Acquisition)**
**Was:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (SDLT calculation error only)  
**Now:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (+ ROI feasibility question)

**Evidence:**
- **Codex claims:** "£2M uplift impossible from £150k purchase without build finance far exceeding £200k"
- **My original assessment:** Flagged SDLT error but accepted ROI as feasible
- **Reality check:** Can £150k acquisition → £2M profit work within £200k capital?

**Financial feasibility analysis:**
```
Scenario: £145k acquisition + £55k costs = £200k total

Value creation paths:
Path A - Planning gain only:
- Existing value: £145k (commercial/distressed)
- Post-consent value: £450k (residential consent)
- Gain: £305k (not £2M)

Path B - Planning + light refurb:
- Existing: £145k
- Refurb: £100k (EXCEEDS budget)
- Post-refurb + consent: £600k
- Gain: £455k (still not £2M)

Path C - Build-out required:
- Build costs: £800k-£1.5M
- Requires external funding (violates £200k constraint)
```

**Revised position:**
- **£2M ROI target unrealistic** from £150k acquisition within £200k capital constraint
- **Realistic ROI:** £300k-£500k through planning gain + minor works
- **Codex is correct:** Achieving £2M requires build finance beyond budget

**Business case impact:** Approach still valid (strong motivation signal) but **profit expectations must be reduced to £300k-£500k**, not £2M.

---

## **Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**

### **1. Claude - Approach A (High-Density Mixed-Use Precedent)**
**Still:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Evidence:** All LLMs agree "Development Type" filter doesn't exist (consensus reached). My fix suggestion stands:
```
Replace: Development Type: contains 'Mixed Use'
With: Proposal: contains "mixed use" OR "mixed-use"
```
**No change needed** - fix is straightforward and agreed upon.

---

### **2. Claude - Approach C (Stalled Planning + Fresh Option)**
**Still:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filter naming issues acknowledged, fix provided. No disagreement on viability once corrected.

---

### **3. Claude - Approach E (Green Belt Exception Sites)**
**Still:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Agricultural value filter substitution acknowledged. Business case dependency on HA partnerships noted. No factual dispute.

---

### **4. Codex - Approach B (Sub-£200k Mixed-Use Footfall Edge)**
**Still:** ✅ VALID  
**Reasoning:** No technical or business case challenges raised. Filters correct, capital realistic.

---

### **5. Codex - Approach C (Distressed Company Mixed-Use Sites)**
**Still:** ✅ VALID  
**Reasoning:** Uses confirmed valid "Company status: Liquidation" filter (see LEARNINGS_DATABASE). No disputes.

---

### **6. Gemini - Approach A (High-Density Intensification)**
**Still:** ✅ VALID  
**Reasoning:** No technical or business case challenges raised. Conservative capital deployment, sound logic.

---

### **7. Grok - Approach A (High-Density Intensification Precedent)**
**Still:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filter logic contradiction acknowledged (height + proposal mismatch). Fix provided. No new evidence changes assessment.

---

### **8. Grok - Approach B (PDR Conversion)**
**Still:** ✅ VALID  
**Reasoning:** Excellent use of PDR filters with proper exclusions. Minor capital range adjustment noted but doesn't affect validity.

---

## **Clarifications:**

### **On "Max building height on title (m)" filter name:**
**Disagreement #6** (Gemini claims should be "Max building height on title (m)" vs abbreviated form)

**My position:** This is **minor naming precision** - both forms likely work in SearchLand AI's natural language parser. Gemini may be overly strict. I used the full name "Max building height on title (m)" in my fixes, which aligns with AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md.

**Impact:** None - no change to validity assessments.

---

### **On precedent-based approaches (business case auto-valid per user instructions):**
**Note:** User states "For precedent-based approaches, business case is auto-valid (user requested); focus on filter accuracy."

**Applied to:**
- Claude A: Focus on filter corrections, not questioning £2M-£4M viability
- Codex A: Focus on filter existence issues, not business model
- Grok A: Focus on filter logic, not ROI targets

**However:** I still flagged **capital feasibility** issues (Claude B, Gemini B) because those affect **implementation possibility**, not strategy validity. £2M ROI is fine as a target; £210k exceeding £200k budget is a **hard constraint violation**.

---

## **Revised Summary Matrix**

| LLM | Approach | OLD Status | NEW Status | Reason for Change |
|-----|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Claude** | A: Precedent | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | No change (fix agreed) |
| **Claude** | B: Article 4 | ✅ VALID | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Capital feasibility depends on option fee negotiation |
| **Claude** | C: Stalled Planning | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | No change |
| **Claude** | D: PDR Industrial | ✅ VALID | ❌ **INVALID** | **B2 has no PDR to residential** (Gemini correct) |
| **Claude** | E: Green Belt | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | No change |
| **Codex** | A: Slough | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | ❌ **INVALID** | **"Decision" and "LPA" filters don't exist** (3:1 consensus) |
| **Codex** | B: Sub-£200k | ✅ VALID | ❌ **INVALID** | **OR syntax invalid** (Gemini/Grok correct) |
| **Codex** | C: Distressed | ✅ VALID | ❌ **INVALID** | **OR syntax invalid** (Gemini/Grok correct) |
| **Gemini** | A: Intensification | ✅ VALID | ✅ VALID | No change |
| **Gemini** | B: Liquidation | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | **£2M ROI unrealistic** (Codex correct) - reduce to £300k-£500k |
| **Grok** | A: Intensification | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | No change |
| **Grok** | B: PDR | ✅ VALID | ✅ VALID | No change |

---

## **Revised Overall Assessment**

### ✅ **Fully Valid Approaches (3 total - down from 7):**
1. **Gemini A** - Intensification Option
2. **Grok B** - PDR Conversion
3. *(All others have technical or feasibility issues)*

### ⚠️ **Conditional Approaches (6 total - fixable with revisions):**
1. **Claude A** - Precedent (filter name corrections needed)
2. **Claude B** - Article 4 (capital feasibility depends on option fee negotiations)
3. **Claude C** - Stalled Planning (filter name corrections needed)
4. **Claude E** - Green Belt (filter substitutions + HA partnership dependency)
5. **Gemini B** - Liquidation (reduce ROI target to £300k-£500k, fix SDLT)
6. **Grok A** - Intensification (resolve filter logic contradiction)

### ❌ **Invalid Approaches (3 total - require fundamental restructuring):**
1. **Claude D** - PDR Industrial (**B2 has no PDR to residential** - must retarget E(g)(iii))
2. **Codex A** - Slough Precedent (**filters don't exist** - must use proxies)
3. **Codex B & C** - (**OR syntax invalid** - must rewrite with `is one of`)

---

## **Key Learnings from This Iteration:**

1. **Filter existence verification is CRITICAL** - Codex's claim that "Decision" and "LPA" filters exist was factually wrong (3:1 consensus against)

2. **Planning law must be verified independently** - My failure to catch B2/Class MA mismatch shows validation must go beyond filter syntax to legal premise

3. **OR syntax is NOT supported in SearchLand** - Gemini/Grok caught what I missed; enum fields require `is one of`, not `contains... OR...`

4. **Capital feasibility ≠ ROI targets** - £2M profit is fine as aspiration; £210k when budget is £200k is a hard constraint violation

5. **3:1 consensus on factual disputes should override minority position** - When 3 LLMs agree filter doesn't exist and it's absent from documentation, that's definitive

---

**Updated Assessment Complete:** 2025-01-19  
**Revision Reason:** Disagreement analysis revealed factual errors in original validation  
**Status:** 3 VALID, 6 CONDITIONAL, 3 INVALID (down from 7/5/0)

### Iteration_Codex (Round 1)

Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:
- Claude – Approach D (PDR B2→C3): Was CONDITIONAL, now INVALID because Class MA only covers Class E to C3; B2 (General Industrial) has no PDR route to residential. Even with sui generis claims, B2→C3 needs full planning, so the legal premise fails.

Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:
- Codex – Approach A (Slough 8-storey precedent): Still INVALID on filters because `Decision`/planning status and `Local Planning Authority` filters don’t exist in the available SearchLand list; must switch to proposal keywords + date proxies and geography via coordinates/areas or “Neighbouring Local Planning Authorities of.”
- Codex – Approaches B & C (Use class OR syntax): Still INVALID syntax as written; SearchLand supports single-condition filters and limited AND chaining, not inline OR within one line. Needs separate `Use class: is one of E, Mixed` entries or multiple lines without OR operators.
- Claude – Approach B (Article 4 expiry): Still INVALID business case; acquiring and converting three offices requires well over £200k equity (even one £200/sqft, 5k sqft building implies £1M purchase plus capex). No Article 4 expiry filter exists—only Article 4 coverage—so both technical and capital sides fail.
- Gemini – Approach B (Liquidation acquisition to £2M): Still INVALID business case; a £150k distressed purchase plus £35k fees can’t yield £2M without heavy development capex far beyond the £200k capital cap. Without an option/promotion or external finance plan, ROI target is infeasible.

Clarifications:
- Height filter naming: use `Max building height on title (m)` (as per available filters); minor naming precision only.

### Iteration_Gemini (Round 1)

Loaded cached credentials.
### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

Based on the disagreement analysis and a review of the provided reference materials, I have reconsidered my positions.

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- **Claude - Approach B (Article 4 Direction Expiry):** Was **CONDITIONAL**, now **INVALID**.
    - **Reasoning:** I previously focused on the technical issue of the missing `Article 4 expiry date` filter. However, the business case critique raised by another LLM is more critical. The strategy requires acquiring and converting three office buildings. The capital required for acquisition, even if structured via options, plus professional fees and construction costs, would vastly exceed the user's stated £200k capital limit. The business case is therefore non-viable as presented.

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- **Claude - Approach D (Permitted Development - Light Industrial to Resi):** Still **INVALID**.
    - **Evidence:** The legal premise is incorrect. The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development etc.) (England) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2021 introduced Class MA, which permits change of use from Commercial, Business and Service (Class E) to residential (C3). It does **not** apply to General Industrial (Class B2). Therefore, the core of the strategy is legally non-viable.

- **Codex - Approach A (Slough 8-Storey Precedent Match):** Still **INVALID**.
    - **Evidence:** The approach relies on filters that do not exist. The reference document `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` confirms there is no `Decision` filter for planning status, nor is there a direct `Local Planning Authority` filter. The approach is unexecutable as written.

- **Codex - Approach B & C (Use class filter syntax):** Still **CONDITIONAL** (i.e., requires fixing to be valid).
    - **Evidence:** The syntax `Use class: contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"` is invalid on two counts. The `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` file explicitly states: 1) "SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line," and 2) "Enum fields require exact matches," making the `contains` operator incorrect for the `Use class` filter. The query would fail.

**Clarifications:**
- **Gemini - Approach B (Liquidation Acquisition):** My **VALID** assessment is maintained, but the business case requires clarification. The critique that a <£150k purchase cannot generate a £2M profit with only £50k remaining capital for CAPEX is correct *if* the strategy is to build out the development. However, this approach is viable only as a **planning-gain strategy**. The business model is to:
    1. Use the capital to acquire a distressed asset at a discount.
    2. Secure a high-value planning permission (e.g., for an 8-storey, mixed-use scheme).
    3. Sell the site *with the valuable planning permission in place* to a larger developer.
    The £2M ROI is generated from the arbitrage between the distressed purchase price and the post-permission land value, not from the Gross Development Value of a completed building. The user's capital is sufficient for the acquisition and planning process, but not for construction.

### Updated Assessment (Technical & Business Case)

**Approaches I'm changing my assessment on:**
- Approach Claude - Approach A (High-Density Mixed-Use Precedent Replication): Was CONDITIONAL, now INVALID because "Development Type: contains Mixed Use" filter does not exist in SearchLand (confirmed by AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md); precedent-based business case remains valid per user request, but technical execution impossible without proxy filters.
- Approach Claude - Approach D (Permitted Development - Light Industrial to Resi): Still INVALID because Class MA PDR does not apply to B2 (General Industrial) use class (verified via planning law research; only applies to A1-A5, B1(a), D1-D2, Sui Generis); even if filters were provided, legal premise is flawed.
- Approach Codex - Approach A (Slough 8-Storey Precedent Match): Was CONDITIONAL, now INVALID because "Decision: is one of Approved" and "Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough" filters do not exist (confirmed by AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md); precedent-based business case remains valid per user request.
- Approach Codex - Approach B & C (Use class filter syntax): Was CONDITIONAL, now INVALID because "Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'" uses OR within single filter line, which SearchLand does not support (confirmed by LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md); must use separate filter groups.
- Approach Claude - Approach B (Article 4 Direction Expiry): Was INVALID, now CONDITIONAL because filters exist but capital feasibility requires modeling; £2.8M profit from 3 conversions is aggressive but possible with low acquisition costs/options, though exceeds £200k budget if full build finance needed (Codex concern valid for full acquisition).
- Approach Gemini - Approach B (Liquidation Acquisition): Was VALID, now CONDITIONAL because £150k liquidation purchase yielding £2M profit is feasible in distressed scenarios but requires build finance exceeding £200k envelope if conversion costs are high (Codex concern partially valid).

**Approaches I'm maintaining my assessment on:**
- Approach Codex - Approach A (Height filter name): Still CONDITIONAL because "Max building height (m)" vs "Max building height on title (m)" is a minor naming precision issue; both forms likely work in SearchLand, but Gemini's version is more accurate per AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md.
- Approach Gemini - Approach A (Intensification): Still VALID because filters exist, syntax correct, units accurate; precedent-based business case valid per user request.
- Approach Grok - Approach A (Intensification): Still VALID because filters exist, syntax correct, units accurate; precedent-based business case valid per user request.
- Approach Grok - Approach B (PDR): Still VALID because filters exist, syntax correct, units accurate; business case achievable via direct purchase/option.

**Clarifications:**
- For precedent-based approaches (Claude A, Codex A, Gemini A, Grok A), business case is auto-valid per user request, so assessments focus solely on filter accuracy/syntax; non-precedent approaches (Claude B/D, Codex B/C, Gemini B) evaluate full technical and business viability.
- Planning law verification confirms Class MA PDR excludes B2 (General Industrial), aligning with Gemini's position over Claude's.
- Filter existence disputes resolved via AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md; no "Decision", "Development Type", or direct "Local Planning Authority" filters exist.
- Syntax disputes resolved via LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md; OR within single filter lines unsupported.
- Capital disputes require financial modeling but lean toward conditional viability for distressed/low-cost scenarios, acknowledging Codex's budget concerns.

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**"Contains" on Enum Fields:**
```
❌ Use class: contains "E"
```
- Enum fields require exact matches
- **Correct:** `Use class: is one of "E - Commercial, Business and Service", "Sui Generis"`

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

### Format for New Entries:

```markdown
### "Filter Name" ⚠️ OPTIONAL: Flag if critical/new
```
Discovered: YYYY-MM-DD (Source: Project/User name)

Behavior/Insight:
- [What was discovered]
- [Why it matters]
- [How to use it]

Example:
1. [Exact filter usage]

Performance/Notes:
- [Any observations]
```
Related: [Link to FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable]
```

### Recent Contributions:
