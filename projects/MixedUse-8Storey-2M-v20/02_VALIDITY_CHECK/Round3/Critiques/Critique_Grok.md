### Claude - Approach A: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Multiple critical filter errors including non-existent filters (Planning Status, Development Type, Planning Description, Number of Storeys) and incorrect syntax/operators. Units are correct but filters won't execute.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- No "Planning Status" filter exists (use proxy with Last application submitted + Proposal keywords)  
- No "Development Type" filter exists  
- No "Planning Description" filter exists  
- No "Number of Storeys" filter exists (use Max building height on title (m) instead)  
- Syntax errors: "contains "Approved" OR "Permission Granted"" invalid (no OR in single filter)  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A (too many invalid filters to fix conditionally)  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Precedent-based approach is strategically sound but requires valid filters to implement  

### Claude - Approach B: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Similar to Approach A - relies on non-existent filters (Planning Status, Development Type, Number of Storeys) and incorrect syntax. No filter list provided but description indicates same issues.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- No "Planning Status" filter exists  
- No "Development Type" filter exists  
- No "Number of Storeys" filter exists  
- PTAL filter valid but London-only (may not apply nationally)  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Regulation-driven strategy is diverse but invalid filters prevent execution  

### Claude - Approach C: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Same filter validity issues as previous approaches - non-existent Planning Status, Development Type, and Number of Storeys filters.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- No "Planning Status" filter exists  
- No "Development Type" filter exists  
- No "Number of Storeys" filter exists  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Time arbitrage concept is strategically diverse but requires valid implementation  

### Claude - Approach D: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Filter issues persist - no Planning Status or Development Type filters, and syntax errors.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- No "Planning Status" filter exists  
- No "Development Type" filter exists  
- Syntax: "contains "storey" OR "storeys"" invalid  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- PDR strategy is viable but invalid filters block it  

### Claude - Approach E: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Non-existent filters (Planning Status, Development Type) and syntax issues prevent execution.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- No "Planning Status" filter exists  
- No "Development Type" filter exists  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Community-led approach adds diversity but needs valid filters  

### Codex - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Two invalid filters (Local Planning Authority, Decision) but most others valid. Units correct, syntax mostly proper. Capital (£180k) within budget, ROI (£3M) achievable via option strategy. Implementation viable with option agreements.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- No "Local Planning Authority" filter exists  
- No "Decision" filter exists (use Last application submitted + Proposal instead)  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Replace invalid filters with: Last application submitted: is after 2020-01-01 AND Proposal: contains "approved"  
- Use Max building height on title (m) for height constraints  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Slough precedent focus provides strong validation signal  

### Codex - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** One major syntax error in Use class filter (invalid OR logic and "Mixed" not a use class value). Other filters valid, units correct. Capital (£200k) meets budget, ROI (£4M) realistic. Implementation viable via direct purchase.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Use class syntax invalid: "contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed"" (no OR, "Mixed" not a use class)  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Low-capital entry strategy diversifies from precedent-based approaches  

### Codex - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Filters mostly valid but syntax issues with Use class (invalid OR). Units correct. Capital (£190k) within budget, ROI achievable. Implementation viable with distressed sales.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Use class syntax invalid: "contains "E" OR Use class: contains "Mixed""  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Liquidation motivation adds strong deal flow potential  

### Gemini - Approach A: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and syntax correct. Units (acres, metres) proper. Capital (£65k) well within budget, ROI (£3M) achievable via options. Implementation viable with option agreements. Deal structure (options) legally sound.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Low-capital option strategy maximizes leverage on £200k budget  

### Gemini - Approach B: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters valid and syntax correct. Units proper. Capital (£185k) within budget, ROI realistic via distressed acquisitions. Implementation viable with quick due diligence. Deal structure sound for liquidations.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None  

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  

**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Liquidation focus provides extreme seller motivation diversity  

### Grok - Approach A: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and syntax correct. Units (acres, metres) proper. Capital within budget, ROI achievable. Implementation viable via options. Deal structure sound.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**

### Grok - Approach B: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters valid and syntax correct. Units (sqft, acres) proper. Capital within budget, ROI via PDR realistic. Implementation viable with conversions. Deal structure sound.  

**Technical Issues (if any):**
