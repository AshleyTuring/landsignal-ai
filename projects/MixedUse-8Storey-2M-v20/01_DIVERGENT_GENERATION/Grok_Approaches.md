### Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A: Expired/Stalled Planning + Pattern 5A: Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone

**Capital Required:** £150,000-£200,000 (acquisition + planning)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (narrow focus on Slough and similar areas)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
7. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
8. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with stalled planning applications similar to the Slough 8-storey mixed-use development, focusing on low-rise buildings in accessible areas with existing mixed-use proposals. The precedent shows demolition and reconstruction is viable, so we seek sites with old planning (applications <3 in 5 years, inactive buildings) but clear development intent (dwellings applied for >0). Proximity to transport supports tall building policy, enabling 8-storey intensification. With £200k capital, this could yield £2M profit through planning derisking and resale to housebuilders.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching the Slough approval (mixed-use, storey height, demolition)
- Information arbitrage: Owners may not realize planning value post-approval
- Lower competition in stalled sites
- Transport proximity supports policy for height

**Limitations:**
- Limited to areas with tall building policy (London/Slough-like)
- May require planning amendments for exact 8-storey scheme
- Inactive buildings could have hidden structural issues

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for sites with mixed-use/storey proposals and low activity.
2. Research planning history via local authority portals to confirm stalled status.
3. Approach owners with precedent evidence from Slough approval.
4. Secure option agreement (£10k-£20k) while applying for planning.
5. Negotiate based on time pressure (owner may want quick sale).
6. Exit via planning permission sale to developer.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option agreement and legals: £15,000
- Planning application and consultants: £50,000
- Acquisition (discounted stalled site): £135,000
- **Total:** £200,000

### Approach B: Regulation-Driven HMO License Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 8A: HMO Expired Licenses + Pattern 2D: Liquidation/Administration Sales

**Capital Required:** £100,000-£150,000 (acquisition + conversion)

**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (broader regulation-driven pool)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before [current date]
3. Ownership type: is one of [Company, Corporate]
4. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
6. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
8. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
```

**Rationale:**
This non-precedent approach exploits regulation-driven motivation: expired HMO licenses make properties illegal to operate, forcing renewal (£1k-£3k) or sale. Combined with company liquidation (forced asset sales), this creates distressed pricing. Sites can be converted to mixed-use (like the Slough precedent) or intensified. With £200k capital, acquire distressed HMOs, renew licenses, and sell at market value for £2M profit through quick flips or rental yield.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation: Legal pressure to act immediately
- Distressed pricing enables high profit margins
- Broader pool than precedent-specific searches
- Can convert to mixed-use post-acquisition

**Limitations:**
- May require license renewal costs and compliance work
- Limited to HMO-eligible areas (not all locations)
- Company liquidation can involve complex legal processes

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for expired HMO licenses in liquidation companies.
2. Verify license status via local authority HMO registers.
3. Approach liquidators with cash offers for quick closure.
4. Acquire, renew licenses (£1k-£3k), and refurbish minimally.
5. Convert to mixed-use or sell as HMO investment.
6. Exit via auction or direct sale to investors.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition (distressed): £80,000
- License renewal and legals: £5,000
- Basic refurbishment: £15,000
- **Total:** £100,000

### Approach C: Low Capital Airspace Intensification

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom + Pattern 4A: Sub-£200k Direct Purchase

**Capital Required:** £50,000-£100,000 (airspace rights + minimal build)

**Expected Results:** 30-60 properties (wide low-capital focus)

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: is equal to Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
3. Sales listing price: is less than 200000
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
5. Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
7. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
```

**Rationale:**
This capital-efficient approach targets undervalued freehold sites with flat roofs and height headroom for airspace development, enabling 4-6 storey additions (scaling toward 8-storey potential). Direct purchase under £200k capital allows multiple deals, with airspace rights purchased cheaply (£20k-£50k). Unlike precedent-focused strategies, this exploits physical characteristics for intensification, potentially yielding £2M profit through volume (5-10 sites) or single large flips to mixed-use.

**Strengths:**
- Very low capital entry (direct purchase + airspace)
- Physical arbitrage: Flat roofs enable easy additions
- Volume strategy possible with £200k budget
- No planning precedent required (PDR or airspace rights)

**Limitations:**
- Requires structural surveys and freeholder negotiation
- May face local opposition to height increases
- Dependent on freehold availability

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for on-market freeholds with flat roofs under £200k.
2. Conduct structural surveys (£5k-£10k) to confirm height capacity.
3. Negotiate airspace rights from freeholders (£20k-£50k).
4. Apply for planning permission for additional storeys.
5. Sell planning permission or develop minimally.
6. Scale by repeating on multiple sites.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Acquisition: £50,000
- Airspace rights: £30,000
- Surveys and legals: £10,000
- **Total:** £90,000
