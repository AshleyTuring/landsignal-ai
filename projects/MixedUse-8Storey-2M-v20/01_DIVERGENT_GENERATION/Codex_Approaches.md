**Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Sweep**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A – Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones (precedent-based for 8-storey mixed-use)  
**Capital Required:** ~£150k (option + fees) via 12–18m option/subject-to-planning  
**Expected Results:** 15–40 titles

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Local planning authority: contains "Slough"
2. Planning application decision: is equal to Approved
3. Proposal: contains "mixed use" AND "storey"
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
5. Max building height (m): is less than 12
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 1.5
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:** Mirrors the 8-storey Slough precedent by filtering approved mixed-use schemes with sub-12m stock near rail (policy support for intensification). Tight area band ensures urban plots viable for 6–8 storeys. On-market flag surfaces motivated vendors; option/subject-to-planning keeps equity outlay low.

**Strengths:**  
- Direct precedent match in same LPA; strong planning comparables  
- Underheight + rail proximity = uplift via tall-building policies  
- Mixed-use classes pre-aligned; reduces change-of-use risk  
- On-market improves strike rate with minimal canvassing  
- Defined plot size keeps buildable depth without over-assembly

**Limitations:**  
- Reliant on accurate proposal text; may miss coded descriptions  
- PTAL not available outside London; using station distance proxy  
- On-market filter narrows pool; may exclude quieter opportunities  
- Build height data can be incomplete on some titles

**Implementation Strategy:**  
1) Pull shortlisted approvals; map height vs. plot depth to target 6–8 storeys.  
2) Offer 5–10% option premium (£40–60k) with 9–12m window; anchor on existing consent value.  
3) Run massing test-fit to show precedent uplift vs. current height.  
4) Negotiate step-in rights on existing consent; secure GIA re-optimization (core efficiency, single stair).  
5) Exit: flip consent or build-to-core-shell with funding partner.

**Capital Breakdown:**  
- Option premium (5–10% of guide): £40k–£60k  
- Legal + DD (planning review, topo, rights-of-light screen): £20k–£30k  
- Architect/massing + transport note: £15k–£25k  
- Planning consultant (s72/s73 revision allowance): £20k–£25k  
- Contingency: £15k–£20k  
- **Total:** ~£150k (within £200k)

**Approach B: Unbroken Freehold HMO Conversion (Capital-Light)**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 23A – Unbroken Freehold Titles + Pattern 22A – HMO Conversion  
**Capital Required:** ~£120k (direct purchase deposit + works tranche)  
**Expected Results:** 20–50 titles

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
2. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
3. Use class: is equal to C3 - Dwellinghouses
4. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
6. Latest sold date: is less than 2004-01-01
7. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1200
```

**Rationale:** Targets large, single-ownership houses (>2,000 sqft) with no leasehold complications—ideal for 6–8 bed HMO conversion. Long-hold private owners often undercapitalised; rail proximity supports occupancy and higher ERV. Capital need stays low via refurb-led uplift; £200k profit achievable by adding beds and EPC uplift.

**Strengths:**  
- No leasehold negotiations; faster execution  
- Proven HMO yield delta (5–8% vs 3–4% BTL)  
- Aging ownership increases negotiation flexibility  
- On-market narrows to active sellers; reduces canvassing time  
- Rail proximity boosts room rates and fill speed

**Limitations:**  
- Article 4 areas will screen out post-download (filter proxy absent)  
- EPC upgrades may be needed; capex risk  
- Vendor expectations can be anchored to retail values  
- Licensing timelines vary by council

**Implementation Strategy:**  
1) Download list; manually exclude Article 4 post-filter.  
2) Offer at 80–85% of guide; request early access for layouts.  
3) Capex plan: reconfigure to 6–8 en-suites, upgrade EPC to C.  
4) Bridge + refurb; refinance to term HMO product in 9–12m.  
5) Retain or sell stabilized HMO; target £2m profit across 5–8 deals (portfolio roll).

**Capital Breakdown:**  
- 10% deposit on £350k–£450k asset: £35k–£45k  
- Stamp + legals + survey: £15k–£18k  
- Refurb/fit-out (per unit): £45k–£55k  
- Licensing/compliance (fire, EPC C): £7k–£10k  
- Contingency: £5k–£8k  
- **Total:** ~£120k (within £200k)

**Approach C: Brand Covenant Expiry Reposition (QSR/Retail to Mixed Use)**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 20A – Brand Covenant Expiry (repurpose expiring E-class sites)  
**Capital Required:** ~£180k (option + prep for change-of-use/intensification)  
**Expected Results:** 10–25 titles

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Use class: contains any [E(a) - Display or retail sale of goods, E(b) - Food and drink]
2. Lease end date: is less than 2027-01-01
3. Average daily footfall: is greater than 6000
4. Max building height (m): is less than 12
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.0
6. Ownership type: is one of [Company]
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:** Expiring QSR/retail covenants create income cliffs; landlords are motivated. Low-rise <12m assets in high-footfall, rail-served locations are ripe for vertical mixed-use or resi-led redevelopment. Footfall assures ground-floor value retention; uplift from additional floors captures profit. Option/JV structure keeps equity outlay below £200k.

**Strengths:**  
- Lease expiry = hard motivation trigger  
- High footfall protects ground-floor ERV post-redevelopment  
- Underheight stock offers clear planning uplift story  
- Company ownership simplifies negotiation vs fragmented titles  
- Rail adjacency bolsters mixed-use planning case

**Limitations:**  
- Some leases have renewal rights; needs legal review  
- Fit-out reinstatement obligations can add cost  
- Brand approvals/exit clauses may slow timelines  
- Footfall data may overstate evening demand; cross-check use timing

**Implementation Strategy:**  
1) Target assets 12–24m pre-expiry; propose option with stepped premium.  
2) Run feasibility for 4–6 storey add-on while retaining E-class at ground.  
3) Negotiate dilapidations set-off to lower option strike.  
4) Submit pre-app for vertical extension/mixed-use intensification.  
5) Flip consented scheme or partner with local builder for shell-and-core.

**Capital Breakdown:**  
- Option premium (5–8% of £600k–£900k): £40k–£70k  
- Legal (lease/dilaps review): £15k–£20k  
- Planning + pre-app + transport note: £25k–£35k  
- Architect/massing + viability: £20k–£30k  
- Technical surveys (structure, MEP, rights of light desktop): £15k–£20k  
- Contingency: £15k–£25k  
- **Total:** ~£180k (within £200k)
