**Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones  
**Capital Required:** ~£180k (control via option/JV, planning, fees)  
**Expected Results:** 15-35 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Decision: is equal to Approved
3. Title address: contains "Slough"
4. Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
5. Max building height (m): is less than 12
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.8
```

**Rationale:** Mirrors the 8-storey approval by surfacing already-approved mixed-use schemes in Slough that remain low-rise (<12m) and close to rail (Crossrail/Elizabeth Line uplift). Tight title size avoids towers but supports mid-rise infill; dual use classes match the precedent.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent match in same authority
- Rail adjacency supports higher density case
- Low existing height → clear uplift story
- Approved schemes reduce planning risk

**Limitations:**
- Slough-only scope limits volume
- Some sites may already be under build
- Rail proximity may increase land cost
- Height data gaps on some titles

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Shortlist approved but unbuilt titles; run site visits for activity check.
- Approach owners with option/JV to conserve capital; anchor on precedent height/massing.
- Pre-app for height uplift referencing identical approval language.
- Secure rights to light/daylight/party wall early for 8-storey envelope.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option fee/lock-out: £60k  
- Planning/consultants (DA/DS/TA/DAS): £70k  
- Surveys/legal (topo, rights of light, legals): £30k  
- Contingency: £20k  
- **Total:** £180k (≤ £200k)

**Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (Cashflow Upside)**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 22A HMO Conversion  
**Capital Required:** ~£150k (direct purchase/bridge + works)  
**Expected Results:** 20-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
2. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Targets oversized single C3 units with poor EPC (regulation-driven motivation) and unbroken titles (no leaseholder friction). Stale planning history reduces objection risk; >2000 sqft supports 6–8 bed HMOs delivering 5–8% yield vs BTL 3–4%.

**Strengths:**
- Low acquisition friction (freehold, no leaseholds)
- EPC pressure motivates discount
- Clear HMO scale and room count viability
- Minimal planning history simplifies conversion

**Limitations:**
- Licensing/Article 4 pockets must be checked manually
- EPC F/G may imply heavier capex
- Floor area data may be missing on some records
- Local amenity space standards vary

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Map Article 4 areas; exclude manually post-export.
- Offer fast completion to EPC-stressed owners; use bridge + refurb.
- Pre-app or cert-of-lawfulness where layout stays C3→C4/Sui Generis thresholds.
- Phase works: fabric/EPC upgrade first, then HMO-specific fit-out.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Deposit/bridge costs within £200k cap: £80k  
- Refurb/HMO compliance (FD30 doors, LD2 alarms, EPC uplift): £50k  
- Professional fees/licence/planning: £10k  
- Contingency: £10k  
- **Total:** £150k (≤ £200k)

**Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit (Add Floors)**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles + Pattern 5A Low-Rise in Tall Zones  
**Capital Required:** ~£170k (option/JV + planning)  
**Expected Results:** 12-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]
2. Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Max building height (m): is less than 12
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.4
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Finds “shops with tops” style freeholds with no leasehold stack to block roof/airspace schemes. Low current height in rail-served zones creates a tall-building policy mismatch; clean planning history reduces precedent objections.

**Strengths:**
- Single negotiation (no leaseholders)
- Strong transit PTAL proxy → supports extra storeys
- Mixed-use income can support holding costs
- Quiet planning history = fewer constraints

**Limitations:**
- Some commercial tenants may have lease protections; review terms
- Height data can be incomplete; field validation needed
- Smaller titles limit deep footprints; stacking relies on vertical build
- Rail adjacency can trigger noise mitigation costs

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Title review for tenant break/expiry to align with build start.
- Negotiate airspace/roof rights via option; share uplift with owner to lower upfront.
- Commission massing/DS with acoustic/glazing strategy for rail noise.
- Use lightweight construction to minimize strengthening of existing frame.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/airspace premium: £70k  
- Planning/massing/consultants: £60k  
- Surveys/legal (structure, title, noise): £20k  
- Contingency: £20k  
- **Total:** £170k (≤ £200k)
