### Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A: Expired/Stalled Planning (adapted for precedent analysis)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000 (acquisition) + £50,000 (planning/legals) = £200,000 total  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 50
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with similar planning precedents to the approved 8-storey mixed-use development in Slough, focusing on stalled or expired planning applications for tall mixed-use buildings. By replicating the successful Slough approval, we identify opportunities where planning work has been done but development stalled, allowing us to revive or adapt existing consents. The capital fits within £200k by focusing on undervalued sites with partial planning derisking, potentially yielding £2M profit through quick planning approval and sale to housebuilders.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching reduces planning risk
- Targets sites with existing development intent (max dwellings >50)
- Low capital entry via stalled projects
- Transport proximity enhances viability

**Limitations:**
- Limited to sites with similar proposal keywords
- May require planning amendments for exact replication
- Geographic concentration around Slough-like areas
- Inactive buildings may need demolition

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 10-30 sites with mixed-use planning precedents
2. Verify planning history via local authority searches for similar approvals
3. Approach owners with precedent evidence from Slough approval
4. Secure option agreements (£10k-£20k) to control sites
5. Apply for planning extensions or minor amendments using Slough as case law
6. Develop or sell to housebuilder at planning stage for £2M+ profit

### Approach B: Fresh Planning Consent Arbitrage
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 13A: Fresh Planning Consents  
**Capital Required:** £50,000 (options on multiple sites) + £150,000 (acquisition of winner) = £200,000 total  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Last application submitted: is after 2025-11-15
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
```

**Rationale:**
This time-sensitive approach exploits information arbitrage by targeting properties with very recent planning approvals (within 24-48 hours of SearchLand refresh), where owners may not yet realize the increased value. Unlike precedent-based strategies, this focuses on fresh consents across various development types, capitalizing on first-mover advantage before market awareness. With £200k capital, we can option multiple sites (£5k-£10k each) and acquire the best one, aiming for £2M profit by flipping at informed market value.

**Strengths:**
- Information asymmetry advantage (owners unaware of value jump)
- Broad applicability beyond specific precedents
- Low per-site capital commitment via options
- Fast execution (24-48 hour window)

**Limitations:**
- Requires daily monitoring of SearchLand refreshes
- Competition from other first-movers
- Fresh consents may still face appeals or conditions
- Geographic spread may increase due diligence costs

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Monitor SearchLand daily for new approvals (last application submitted filter)
2. Identify 20-50 sites with recent consents and contact owners immediately
3. Secure option agreements (£5k-£10k) on promising sites to lock in pre-market pricing
4. Select and acquire the strongest opportunity within £150k
5. Hold or sell quickly at market value, capturing £2M profit from arbitrage
6. Repeat process with remaining option capital for volume

### Approach C: HMO License Deadline Exploitation
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 8A: HMO Expired Licenses  
**Capital Required:** £180,000 (acquisition) + £20,000 (license renewal/conversion) = £200,000 total  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-24
3. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
5. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:**
This regulation-driven approach targets HMOs with expired licenses, creating forced seller motivation as properties cannot legally operate. Unlike planning precedents, this exploits regulatory deadlines for quick acquisitions at discounted prices. With £200k capital, we can buy distressed HMOs, renew licenses cheaply (£1k-£3k), and convert/hold for rental income or sell at market value, achieving £2M profit through volume and yield.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation (cannot operate without renewal)
- On-market listings ensure immediate availability
- Low capital for distressed assets
- Transport proximity supports HMO demand

**Limitations:**
- Limited to HMO-specific properties
- May require compliance work before operation
- Geographic restrictions in Article 4 areas
- Competition from other HMO operators

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for expired HMO licenses and review 15-40 active listings
2. Approach owners with renewal offers or direct purchase proposals
3. Acquire distressed HMOs within £180k budget
4. Renew licenses and perform basic improvements with £20k
5. Convert to optimized HMO or hold for 5-8% yield, exiting for £2M profit
6. Scale by targeting multiple licenses in parallel
