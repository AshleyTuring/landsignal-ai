# Disagreement Detection Task

Analyze the 4 critique files and identify TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS CASE DISAGREEMENTS.

## What Counts as Disagreement
- LLM A says filter exists, LLM B says it doesn't (factual dispute)
- LLM A says "acres", LLM B says "sqft" for same filter (unit dispute)
- LLM A says VALID syntax, LLM B says INVALID syntax (technical dispute)
- LLM A says £n is sufficient, LLM B says it's not (capital feasibility dispute)
- LLM A says ROI achievable, LLM B says unrealistic (business case dispute)
- LLM A says deal structure works, LLM B says legally/financially flawed (implementation dispute)

## What Does NOT Count
- Priority rankings (A ranks #1, B ranks #3 - both valid)
- Strategic preferences (speed vs certainty - philosophical)
- Implementation styles (different but both correct)

## Special Note on Precedent-Based Approaches
For approaches replicating user-provided planning applications:
- Business case is AUTO-VALID (user requested it)
- Focus validation on: Do filters actually replicate the precedent correctly?
- Multiple valid filter implementations are expected and acceptable

## Output Format
If disagreements exist:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** [Filter existence | Units | Syntax | Capital feasibility | ROI | Deal structure]
**Approaches:** [Which approaches affected]
**Positions:**
- LLM A: [Position]
- LLM B: [Position]
- LLM C: [Position]
- LLM D: [Position]

**Impact:** [Critical | Minor]
**Requires iteration:** [YES | NO]

---

If no disagreements:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: NO

All LLMs agree on technical and business case facts. Strategic differences are preserved.

- ✅ Deal Structure: Liquidator sales are legally sound and well-understood
- ✅ Implementation: 6-12 month timeline is realistic

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent exploitation of regulatory motivation ("Company status: Liquidation")
- Volume strategy required (4-5 deals) but per-deal profit range is wide enough
- Derelict buildings may have hidden costs - contingency needed

---

### Claude - Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition
**Status:** ✅ VALID (with implementation notes)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate

```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £130k-£200k (at budget limit)
- ✅ ROI Path: £450k-£850k profit × 2-3 deals = £900k-£2.55M ✅ Meets target
- ⚠️ Risk: Medium-High (structural capacity unknown until survey)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Airspace purchase is legally sound, increasingly common in UK
- ⚠️ Implementation: Requires specialist structural engineer - £10k-£15k survey cost factored in

**Implementation Notes:**
- PTAL 4+ limits this to London - correctly noted
- Structural survey is critical gatekeeping step (cost included in capital breakdown)
- Fire safety regulations post-Grenfell are significant - good that this is flagged

**Strategic Notes:**
- Highly capital-efficient strategy
- "Pattern 6A" airspace development is proven approach
- Right to light issues correctly identified as risk

---

### Claude - Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement Promotion
**Status:** ✅ VALID (patient capital strategy)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

10. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £80k-£160k (well within budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: £1.1M-£2.6M total portfolio ✅ Exceeds £2M target
- ⚠️ Timeline: 2-5 years (very long) - correctly flagged as "patient capital"
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option agreements on strategic land are standard practice
- ✅ Implementation: Requires planning promotion consultancy (£40k-£80k correctly allocated)

**Strategic Notes:**
- "No latest sold date" is a rare but powerful filter - correctly used
- Edge of settlement promotion is established strategy in UK land market
- Timeline is realistic for local plan cycles (2-5 years)
- Multiple site portfolio approach spreads risk appropriately

---

### Claude - Approach E: HMO License Expiry + Low EPC Arbitrage
**Status:** ✅ VALID (volume strategy)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: Yes ✅ Valid
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-01-01 ✅ Valid (regulation deadline)
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ✅ Valid

9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500 ✅ Valid
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3 ✅ Valid (HMO scale)
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £160k-£200k per deal (at budget limit)
- ⚠️ ROI Path: £68k-£113k profit per deal × 18-30 deals = £1.22M-£3.39M
  - **Issue:** Need 18-30 deals to reach £2M target - this is a **volume strategy requiring multiple years**
  - Claude correctly identifies this as "volume strategy over 3-4 years"
- ✅ Deal Structure: HMO license renewal + EPC improvement is standard
- ✅ Implementation: Realistic timeline and costs (£2k license + £15k-£25k EPC)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent exploitation of dual regulatory deadlines (HMO + EPC)
- Volume requirement (18-30 deals) is clearly stated and realistic
- Article 4 exclusion is critical - correctly included
- Lower profit per deal but faster turnover (6-12 months each)

## CODEX APPROACHES

### Codex - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification
**Status:** ✅ VALID

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey" ✅ Valid
2. Decision: is equal to Approved ✅ Valid (filter exists)
3. Title address: contains "Slough" ✅ Valid (text search)
4. Use class: contains all [E, C3] ✅ Valid (requires BOTH - mixed-use)
5. Max building height (m): is less than 12 ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600 ✅ Valid
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.8 ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £180k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: Not explicitly stated, but precedent-based strategy suggests similar to Claude Approach A (£700k-£1.1M per deal)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option/JV structure is sound
- ✅ Implementation: Pre-app strategy and rights of light/party wall flagged correctly

**Strategic Notes:**
- Very similar to Claude Approach A (precedent replication)
- "Decision: is equal to Approved" filter adds precision (only approved schemes)
- "contains all" for use class ensures true mixed-use (not single use)
- Capital breakdown is detailed and realistic

---

### Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion
**Status:** ✅ VALID (with manual screening required)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ⚠️ Manual screening required (Article 4 not in filters)

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000 ✅ Valid (sqft confirmed)
2. Use class: contains any [C3] ✅ Valid
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold ✅ Valid
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1 ✅ Valid (no complications)
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company] ✅ Valid
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G] ✅ Valid (motivation signal)
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1 ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £150k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: 5-8% yield (£12k-£18k annual income) + capital appreciation
  - **Note:** This is a **hold strategy** (rental yield), not a quick £2M profit strategy
  - To reach £2M profit from yield alone: Would need 12-16 years OR capital appreciation
  - **Alternative:** Flip to HMO investors at £68k-£113k profit (similar to Claude Approach E)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Bridge + refurb is standard for HMO conversion
- ⚠️ Implementation: Correctly flags Article 4 must be checked manually post-export

**Strategic Notes:**
- "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1" is excellent precision (Pattern 23B)
- EPC E/F/G as motivation signal is well-applied
- Requires clarification on exit strategy (hold vs flip) to validate £2M target

---

### Codex - Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit
**Status:** ✅ VALID

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Property type: is one of [Mixed Use] ✅ Valid
2. Use class: contains all [E, C3] ✅ Valid (requires both)
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1 ✅ Valid (Pattern 23B)
4. Max building height (m): is less than 12 ✅ Valid
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500 ✅ Valid
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.4 ✅ Valid
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1 ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £170k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: Airspace/roof rights development similar to Claude Approach C (£450k-£850k profit per deal)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option on airspace + uplift share is innovative and sound
- ✅ Implementation: Structural survey, massing study, acoustic strategy correctly flagged

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent use of "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1" (Pattern 23B)
- "Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]" + "Use class: contains all [E, C3]" is precise filtering
- Lightweight construction to minimize strengthening costs is astute insight

## GEMINI APPROACHES

### Gemini - Approach A: Precedent-Based Option Agreement
**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Geographic constraint + filter note)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ Most filters exist and correct
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ⚠️ Geographic constraint method unclear

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid exclusions
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5 ✅ Valid
3. Use class: contains any [E, E(g)(iii), B2, Sui Generis] ✅ Valid
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12 ✅ Valid
5. Developed area percentage: is less than 50 ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000 ✅ Valid
7. Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01 ✅ Valid (10+ years)
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No ✅ Valid (off-market)
9. Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ✅ Valid
```

**Technical Issue:**
- ⚠️ **Geographic Constraint:** "Note: This search should be geographically constrained to Slough"
  - **Problem:** SearchLand does NOT have a "Local Authority" or "Borough" dropdown filter visible in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
  - **Workaround:** Use `Title address: contains "Slough"` (as Codex did) OR manually filter results post-export
  - **Impact:** Without this, search returns UK-wide results (loses precedent value)

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add filter:
10. Title address: contains "Slough"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £125k (well within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: Option agreement + planning consent → £700k-£1.1M profit per deal (similar to Claude/Codex Approach A)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option agreement structure is sound
- ✅ Implementation: 18-24 month timeline realistic

**Strategic Notes:**
- "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No" is clever (off-market focus)
- Use class mix includes E(g)(iii), B2, Sui Generis (broader than just E + C3) - valid for commercial/industrial sites

---

### Gemini - Approach B: Strategic Airspace Development
**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Geographic note + similar to Claude C)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ⚠️ Geographic constraint method unclear (same issue as Approach A)

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes ✅ Valid
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ✅ Valid
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0 ✅ Valid (Pattern 23B)
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15 ✅ Valid
5. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other, Residential] ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800 ✅ Valid
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.75 ✅ Valid
```

**Technical Issue:**
- ⚠️ **Geographic Constraint:** "Note: This search is intended for major UK urban centres outside London"
  - **Problem:** No direct filter to specify "Birmingham", "Manchester", etc.
  - **Workaround:** Use `Title address: contains "Birmingham"` OR `Title address: contains "Manchester"` OR manually filter post-export
  - **Impact:** Without this, returns London results (where PTAL would be better) + rural areas (unsuitable)

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add filter (example for Manchester):
9. Title address: contains "Manchester"

OR run multiple searches:
- Manchester search: Title address: contains "Manchester"
- Birmingham search: Title address: contains "Birmingham"
- Leeds search: Title address: contains "Leeds"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £195k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: £450k-£850k profit per deal × 2-3 deals = £900k-£2.55M ✅ Meets target
- ✅ Deal Structure: Airspace purchase is sound
- ✅ Implementation: Structural survey, architectural designs correctly costed

**Strategic Notes:**
- Very similar to Claude Approach C (airspace development)
- "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0" is excellent precision (Pattern 23B)
- "Building use group" filter is good alternative to "Use class" for broad filtering

---

## GROK APPROACHES

### Grok - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Filter interpretation issue)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ Most filters exist
- ⚠️ Filter logic issue (see below)
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Syntax mostly correct

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey" ✅ Valid
2. Use class: contains any [E, C3] ✅ Valid
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 50 ✅ Valid
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20 ⚠️ ISSUE (see below)
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2 ✅ Valid
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3 ✅ Valid
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000 ✅ Valid
```

**Technical Issue:**
- ⚠️ **Filter #4: "Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20"**
  - **Problem:** This searches for buildings **CURRENTLY >20m tall** (~7 storeys)
  - **Strategy Intent:** Find sites for 8-storey development (should be looking for **SHORT buildings with POTENTIAL** to go tall)
  - **Contradiction:** Strategy says "stalled or expired planning" but filter looks for already-tall buildings
  - **Expected:** Should be `is less than 15` (currently low-rise, potential for 8-storey)

**Suggested Fix:**
```
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
```

**Rationale:**
- 8-storey building = ~24-32m tall
- Looking for **intensification opportunity** = currently short (<15m = ~4 storeys) → potential for 8 storeys
- Filter as written (>20m) finds already-tall buildings (no intensification opportunity)

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £150k acquisition + £50k planning = £200k (at budget limit)
- ⚠️ ROI Path: Not explicitly calculated, but strategy aims for £2M profit
  - **Issue:** If acquiring at £150k, property must be worth £2.15M+ with planning (14x+ uplift)
  - **Realistic?** Depends on location, but seems optimistic for single deal
  - **Likely:** Needs 2-3 deals to reach £2M (similar to other precedent approaches)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Strategy description is sound (stalled planning precedent replication)
- Filter #4 contradicts the strategy intent (should seek short buildings, not tall)
- Once corrected, approach is very similar to Claude/Codex/Gemini Approach A

---

### Grok - Approach B: Fresh Planning Consent Arbitrage
**Status:** ✅ VALID (time-sensitive strategy)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Last application submitted: is after 2025-11-15 ✅ Valid (note: date will age)
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20 ✅ Valid
3. Use class: contains any [E, C3] ✅ Valid
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5 ✅ Valid
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company] ✅ Valid
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500 ✅ Valid
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £50k options + £150k acquisition = £200k (creative structure)
- ✅ ROI Path: Information arbitrage (buy at uninformed price, sell at informed price)
  - **Logic:** Owner doesn't know planning approved → sells at land value → buyer flips at development value
  - **Realistic?** Yes, but window is very short (24-48 hours per SearchLand refresh)
  - **Profit:** £2M profit requires significant discount (e.g., buy at £500k, sell at £2.5M) OR multiple deals
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option agreements on multiple sites then acquire best = smart capital allocation
- ✅ Implementation: Requires daily monitoring of SearchLand (operationally intensive)

**Strategic Notes:**
- ⚠️ **Date Filter:** "is after 2025-11-15" will need updating as time passes (not evergreen)
- Excellent exploitation of information asymmetry (Pattern 13A: Fresh Planning Consents)
- Operationally intensive (daily monitoring) but strategy is sound
- Multiple small options (£5k-£10k) spreading risk is clever

---

### Grok - Approach C: HMO License Deadline Exploitation
**Status:** ✅ VALID

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-24 ✅ Valid (note: date will age)
3. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company] ✅ Valid
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5 ✅ Valid
5. Use class: contains any [C3, C4] ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800 ✅ Valid
7. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G] ✅ Valid
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £180k acquisition + £20k renewal/conversion = £200k (at budget limit)
- ✅ ROI Path: Similar to Claude Approach E (£68k-£113k profit per deal OR hold for yield)
  - **Volume Required:** 18-30 deals to reach £2M profit (3-4 years)
  - **OR:** Hold for rental yield (5-8%) and capital appreciation
- ✅ Deal Structure: Acquisition + license renewal + conversion is standard
- ✅ Implementation: Realistic costs and timeline

**Strategic Notes:**
- Very similar to Claude Approach E (HMO license expiry + low EPC)
- ⚠️ **Date Filter:** "is before 2025-11-24" will need updating (not evergreen)
- "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes" focuses on active sellers (faster deals)
- Article 4 mentioned in limitations but NOT in filters (same as Claude - manual screening required)

- "Decision: is equal to Approved" in Approach A adds precision
- "contains all" for Use class ensures true mixed-use (not single use)
- Capital breakdowns are detailed and realistic

**Minor Notes:**
- Approach B exit strategy unclear (hold for yield vs flip for profit) - needs clarification to validate £2M target
- Otherwise all technically sound

---

### 🟡 GEMINI - CONDITIONAL (EASY FIXES)
**Overall:** Strong strategies, minor geographic filtering issues

**Issues:**
1. **Approach A:** Add `Title address: contains "Slough"` to constrain to Slough (precedent value)
2. **Approach B:** Add `Title address: contains "[City]"` to target specific urban centres (Manchester/Birmingham/Leeds)

**Once Fixed:** Both approaches become ✅ VALID

**Standout Features:**
- "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No" (off-market focus) is clever
- "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0" (Pattern 23B) used correctly
- Capital breakdowns detailed

---

### 🟡 GROK - 1 CONDITIONAL, 2 VALID

**Issues:**
1. **Approach A:** Height filter contradicts strategy intent
   - **Current:** `Max building height (m): is greater than 20` (finds tall buildings)
   - **Should be:** `Max building height (m): is less than 15` (finds short buildings with intensification potential)
   - **Impact:** Without fix, returns wrong property type (already tall, not short-to-tall opportunity)

2. **Approaches B & C:** Date filters will age
   - `Last application submitted: is after 2025-11-15` (Approach B)
   - `HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-24` (Approach C)
   - **Not technically invalid**, but not evergreen (will need periodic updating)

**Once Fixed:** Approach A becomes ✅ VALID

**Standout Features:**
- Approach B (Fresh Consent Arbitrage) is innovative time-sensitive strategy
- Option structure (£5k-£10k options on multiple sites) is clever capital allocation
- All three approaches have strong motivation signal exploitation

---

### Critique_Codex

### Claude - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital fits £60k-£120k. ROI plausible if planning uplift achieved. Filters mostly aligned with strategy, but some likely unsupported and syntax may not parse reliably.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter `Building on title is inactive` not in documented set (use `Building on title is derelict` or similar).
- `Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"` may not parse OR; use `contains any [retail, commercial]` or two lines.
- Range lines with `is greater than X AND less than Y` can be partially ignored in complex prompts; split into two lines.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace inactive filter with available motivation/condition filter.
- Split title area and proposal text filters into separate lines; avoid inline OR.
- After parsing, verify all 10 filters were created; add missing ones manually.
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Height <15m targeting intensification is coherent with 8-storey uplift precedent.

---

### Claude - Approach B: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters map to documented options (Company status Liquidation/In Administration, derelict, % un-constrained). Budget £130k-£200k fits ceiling. ROI depends on distress discount but commercially feasible. Syntax needs minor range splitting but otherwise sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Combined range `Title area... greater than 0.2 AND less than 2` may need splitting for reliability.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Very small pool; expect low volume and heavy DD on liabilities.

---

### Claude - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital fits. Airspace ROI feasible if structure supports. Key filters uncertain or geography-limited (PTAL London-only). Flat-roof detection may not exist in AvailableFilters list.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `A building in the title has flat roof: Yes` likely not an available filter; need alternative (e.g., roof type via classification not present).
- PTAL valid but London-only; outside London returns zero.
- Range lines should be split (`Title area`, `Max building height`).  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace flat-roof filter with available proxies (e.g., `Building height (floors)`, `Property classification: Flat/Commercial`, manual desk check).
- Scope to London or swap PTAL for `Distance to nearest Train Station (m)` only.
- Split numeric ranges for parsing reliability.
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Single-building + freehold logic fits airspace strategy; structural due diligence critical.

---

### Claude - Approach D: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Budget okay, but several filters likely unavailable or mis-specified; long 2-5y promotion timeline acceptable but requires patience. ROI assumes allocations materialize—high uncertainty.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes` should be numeric (`Applications in last 5 years: is less than 1`).
- Settlement boundary distance filters may not exist in AvailableFilters; need confirmation/substitutes.
- `Developed area percentage` availability unclear.
- Combined ranges (Title area) need splitting.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Use available proximity proxies (e.g., `Distance to nearest adopted settlement boundary` → if missing, use polygon/ward filters or manual GIS).
- Correct applications filter to numeric comparator.
- Verify availability of developed-area metric; if absent, use `% of plot unconstrained` plus `Building on title is derelict`/`No latest sold date`.
- Split range conditions into separate lines and confirm parsing.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Option-fee stack across 10 sites must stay within £60k; monitor consultancy fees to keep under £160k.

---

### Claude - Approach E: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital fits. Volume target (18-30 deals) stresses data scarcity; HMO licensing datasets and Article 4 coverage may not be available as filters. ROI per deal reasonable if data exists.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Currently has HMO` and `HMO License Expiry Date` are unlikely in AvailableFilters; may not parse.
- `Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]` may be unsupported; Article 4 often not a listed constraint.
- Range lines (Title area) should be split.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace HMO-specific filters with available proxies (e.g., `Use class: contains any [C4]`, `EPC rating`, `Latest sold date`), then verify licensing manually.
- If Article 4 filter missing, remove and screen Article 4 maps separately.
- Split numeric ranges for parsing reliability; verify all filters created before searching.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Scarcity of expired licenses likely caps volume; adjust deal-count expectations or broaden geography.

### Critique_Gemini

Loaded cached credentials.
### Claude_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is technically sound, financially viable within the stated constraints, and logically coherent. It correctly uses an option agreement structure to control a site for planning gain, which is appropriate for the given capital. The SearchLand prompt is well-formed and uses correct syntax and units.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---
### Claude_Approaches - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a strong, viable strategy that correctly identifies a powerful motivation signal (`Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]`). The filters are syntactically correct, the capital allocation for direct acquisition is within budget, and the profit mechanism (buying distressed assets below market value) is a sound business case.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---
### Claude_Approaches - Approach C: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a sophisticated and capital-efficient strategy targeting airspace development. The SearchLand prompt is technically correct, using appropriate filters like `A building in the title has flat roof`, `PTAL`, and `Tenure: is one of [Freehold]`. The capital and ROI calculations are optimistic but plausible for this type of value-add project. The implementation plan correctly identifies key risks like structural capacity.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---
### Claude_Approaches - Approach D: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The core strategy, combining "never sold" legacy holdings with "edge of settlement" for land promotion, is strategically brilliant but technically flawed in its implementation. Two key filters in the prompt have invalid syntax.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Invalid Syntax:** The filter `No latest sold date: Yes` is not a valid construct. The intended outcome is achievable, but the syntax is wrong. It implies a missing operator like `is not present`.
- **Invalid Syntax:** The filter `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes` is incorrect. The filter is `Applications in the last 5 years` and the operator should be `is less than 1`.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes` to `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`.
- The `No latest sold date` filter needs to be re-written based on how the system handles null/non-existent dates, likely with an `is not present` operator if available, or by excluding all properties with a date after the beginning of Land Registry records. A pragmatic fix would be `Latest sold date: is before 1990-01-01` to capture properties that haven't sold in the modern era, though this is less precise.

---
### Claude_Approaches - Approach E: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The strategy of targeting landlords under regulatory pressure from expired HMO licenses and low EPC ratings is excellent. However, the prompt contains a technical error in how it tries to filter out Article 4 areas.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Incorrect Filter Usage:** `Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]` is invalid. `Article 4` is a dedicated, separate filter in SearchLand, not a value within the `Planning constraints` list.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Remove `Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]`.
- Add a new filter line: `Article 4: No`.

---
### Codex_Approaches - Approach A: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is fundamentally flawed because it relies on a non-existent filter and the core logic is contradictory.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Non-Existent Filter:** The filter `Decision: is equal to Approved` does not exist in the provided list of available SearchLand filters. This makes the entire prompt unexecutable as written.
- **Logical Incoherence:** The strategy aims to find sites that are simultaneously "Approved" for mixed-use and still "low-rise" (<12m). This is a logical contradiction. If a site had approval for a tall building, it wouldn't be filtered as low-rise, and if it was approved as low-rise, there's no inherent uplift potential to exploit.

---
### Codex_Approaches - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** A classic and well-executed strategy. The filters for identifying large, freehold C3 properties with low EPC ratings and minimal planning history are technically correct and logically sound for an HMO conversion play. The capital plan and implementation notes (e.g., manually checking Article 4) are realistic.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---
### Codex_Approaches - Approach C: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The strategy is strong, but it fails on a critical technical detail. The very first filter, which is essential to the search, uses an incorrect value for the specified filter name, making the prompt non-functional.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Incorrect Filter Value:** `Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]` is invalid. The `Property type` filter's available values are `Detached`, `Semi-Detached`, `Terraced`, `Flat`, `Commercial`. The correct filter to use would be `Building use group`, which contains `Mixed Use` as a value.

---
### Gemini_Approaches - Approach A: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a highly professional and well-structured approach. It correctly identifies the need for an option agreement to fit the capital constraint. The SearchLand prompt is technically flawless, using a sophisticated combination of filters (e.g., `Latest sold date`, `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No`) to identify off-market opportunities. The capital breakdown and implementation plan are both realistic and coherent.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---
### Gemini_Approaches - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** An excellent and technically sound approach that demonstrates a deep understanding of the reference documents. The strategy of targeting freehold airspace opportunities with zero leaseholders (`Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0`) is a key insight that directly addresses a major real-world implementation risk. The prompt is syntactically correct, and the capital plan is viable.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---
### Grok_Approaches - Approach A: [INVALID]
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is internally inconsistent. It presents a capital plan for direct acquisition (£150k) but an implementation strategy based on option agreements (£10k-£20k). A £150k acquisition budget is not feasible for the type of site described (previous plans for 50+ dwellings), rendering the business case invalid as presented.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Contradictory Financials:** The capital required for acquisition does not align with the implementation strategy or the likely market value of the target assets.

---
### Grok_Approaches - Approach B: [VALID]
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** This is a sophisticated and valid strategy focused on information arbitrage. The use of a dynamic date in the `Last application submitted` filter to catch approvals within a 24-48 hour window is a clever, expert-level technique. The capital plan (using a small amount for options before committing to a larger acquisition) is sound and appropriate for this high-velocity strategy.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---
### Grok_Approaches - Approach C: [CONDITIONAL]
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The core strategy of targeting expired HMO licenses is valid. However, the prompt has a minor syntactical issue, and the choice to exclusively target on-market properties is a potential strategic weakness that reduces leverage, though it doesn't invalidate the approach entirely.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- **Potentially Invalid Syntax:** `EPC rating: is one of E, F, G` is questionable. The documented operator for list-based filters is `contains any`. This may or may not parse correctly.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change `EPC rating: is one of E, F, G` to `EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]` for guaranteed compatibility.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Filtering for `Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes` ensures availability but also guarantees competition and indicates a less-distressed seller compared to an off-market approach. An alternative would be to set this filter to `No` to find owners who are stuck but haven't yet listed the property.

### Critique_Grok

### Claude - Approach A: Precedent Replication - 8-Storey Mixed-Use (Slough Focus)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Approach has strong strategic logic for precedent-based development but contains syntax errors in SearchLand filters that would prevent proper execution. Capital and ROI are feasible within constraints, implementation is viable, and deal structure (option agreements) is sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Invalid syntax in filter 2: "Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"" - SearchLand does not support OR operators within single filter lines; this will fail to parse correctly.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: "Proposal: contains any ["retail", "commercial"]" or split into separate filters if needed.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Slough precedent focus creates geographic concentration risk but leverages proven planning success.

### Claude - Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales at Discount
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Strong motivation signal from distressed corporate sales, capital within budget, ROI achievable through volume, implementation feasible via liquidator contact, deal structure (direct purchase) legally sound. However, syntax error in ownership filter.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Invalid syntax in filter 1: "Ownership type: is equal to Company" - Should use "is one of [Company]" for list-based filters.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: "Ownership type: is one of [Company]".  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Liquidation pool is limited but provides exceptional motivation; combines well with other distressed asset strategies.

### Claude - Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition - Low-Rise to 8-Storey
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and use correct syntax, units are accurate (acres, metres), capital feasible, ROI targets achievable, implementation steps are practical, deal structure (airspace rights purchase) is financially sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Airspace strategy minimizes capital exposure while enabling high-density development.

### Claude - Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement Promotion
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters are valid and correctly formatted, units accurate, capital within limits, ROI projections realistic for patient capital, implementation timeline is long but executable, deal structure (options with promotion) is viable.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Never-sold properties represent hidden opportunity but require extensive due diligence.

### Claude - Approach E: HMO License Expiry + Low EPC Arbitrage
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist with proper syntax, units correct, capital fits budget, ROI achievable through volume strategy, implementation is straightforward, deal structure (direct purchase with compliance fixes) is sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Regulatory deadline creates strong motivation; volume approach suits smaller deal sizes.

### Codex - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Approach relies on non-existent filter for planning decision status, making the core search strategy unexecutable. Other elements (capital, ROI, implementation) appear feasible if filters were corrected.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Filter 2: "Decision: is equal to Approved" - No "Decision" filter exists in SearchLand; cannot filter by planning approval status directly.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Replace with proxy filters like "Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0" and "Last application submitted: is before [recent date]" to target approved schemes.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Precedent focus is strong but requires alternative filtering methods.

### Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (Cashflow Upside)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Solid conversion strategy with feasible capital/ROI, viable implementation, sound deal structure. However, syntax error in tenure filter prevents proper execution.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Invalid syntax in filter 3: "Tenure: is equal to Freehold" - Should use "is one of [Freehold]".  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: "Tenure: is one of [Freehold]".  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- EPC-driven motivation is well-supported by available filters.

### Codex - Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit (Add Floors)
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters valid with correct syntax, units accurate, capital feasible, ROI achievable, implementation practical, deal structure (option/JV) sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Freehold focus avoids lease complications in vertical extensions.
