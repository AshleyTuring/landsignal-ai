# Property Search Strategy Generation
## MixedUse-8Storey-2M Project

Based on your requirements, I'll generate **3+ unique approaches** covering:
1. **Precedent-based** (8-storey mixed-use replication)
2. **Capital-efficient** (£200k constraint)
3. **Motivation-driven** (behavioral arbitrage)

Let me create diverse, empirically testable strategies.

---

## Approach A: Precedent Replication - 8-Storey Mixed-Use (Slough Focus)

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** 
- Option agreement: £20,000-£50,000
- Planning consultancy: £30,000-£50,000
- Legals: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £60,000-£120,000 (exit at planning stage)

**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties (Slough + similar towns)

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
10. Building on title is inactive: Yes
```

**Rationale:**
The approved 8-storey mixed-use in Slough provides **proven planning precedent**. This approach replicates that success by targeting:
- Similar use class combinations (E retail + C3 residential)
- Sites currently low-rise (<15m = ~4 storeys) with intensification potential
- Transport accessibility (<1km station) supporting density policy
- Long-hold properties (sold before 2015) indicating unmotivated/passive ownership
- Inactive buildings suggesting stalled development or tired landlord

**Profit Path:** 
- Secure option £30k → Apply for 8-storey mixed-use consent (£50k) → Sell to developer with planning at £800k-£1.2M → **Net profit £700k-£1.1M per deal**
- Target 2-3 deals to reach £2M profit target

**Strengths:**
- Precedent reduces planning risk (local authority already approved similar scheme)
- Low capital via option agreements (£30k-£50k vs £500k+ outright purchase)
- Transport proximity supports planning policy for intensification
- Inactive buildings = motivation signal (no income, potential sell pressure)
- Slough regeneration focus aligns with mixed-use policy support

**Limitations:**
- Precedent may not transfer perfectly to different sites (microclimate planning)
- Low planning activity (<3 apps) may indicate planning challenges not visible in data
- Requires negotiation skills for option agreements
- Planning process 12-18 months (longer timeline)
- Local opposition risk (NIMBYism for height)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Weeks 1-4:** Run SearchLand filter, export results, conduct desktop due diligence (Land Registry, planning portal)
2. **Weeks 5-8:** Shortlist 10 sites with best precedent match, approach owners with option proposal
3. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate option agreements (12-24 month term, £30k-£50k fee, planning-contingent)
4. **Months 4-6:** Engage planning consultancy, prepare pre-app consultation with LPA
5. **Months 7-18:** Submit planning application citing Slough precedent, manage process
6. **Months 19-20:** Upon approval, market to housebuilders/developers, complete sale
7. **Exit:** Assign option or complete purchase + immediate sale at planning premium

---

## Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales at Discount

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)  
**Capital Required:**
- Acquisition (distressed pricing): £120,000-£180,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £130,000-£200,000 (full budget utilization)

**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (UK-wide, highly targeted)

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Building on title is derelict: Yes
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

**Rationale:**
This approach exploits **maximum behavioral motivation** - companies in liquidation/administration are **legally obligated to sell assets** to repay creditors. Key advantages:
- Liquidators prioritize speed over price (time = cost)
- No emotional attachment (corporate sellers vs family homes)
- Clear decision-maker (liquidator has authority, no committee delays)
- Often 20-40% below market value due to distressed circumstances
- Derelict buildings = double motivation (no income + liabilities)

**Profit Path:**
- Acquire at £150k (30% discount to £215k market value) → Secure planning consent or sell to developer as-is → Exit at £400k-£600k with planning or £250k-£300k as-is → **Profit £100k-£450k per deal**
- Complete 4-5 deals to reach £2M target

**Strengths:**
- **Strongest motivation signal** (forced sale = maximum leverage)
- Fast decision-making (liquidators can't wait)
- Below-market pricing typical (20-40% discount)
- Clear legal process (no gazumping, no chain)
- Cash buyers highly preferred (speed advantage)
- Derelict buildings = value-add opportunity (planning upside)

**Limitations:**
- **Very limited pool** (liquidations rare, <10 results per LPA typical)
- Properties often have issues (structural, contamination, legal complications)
- Other creditors may have claims (secured vs unsecured debt hierarchy)
- Due diligence time-pressured (liquidators want quick completion)
- May require significant refurb/remediation (reduce profit margin)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter, identify 5-15 liquidation/administration cases
2. **Weeks 2-3:** Research company status (Companies House), contact liquidator/administrator directly
3. **Weeks 4-5:** Desktop due diligence (title search, planning history, contamination risk assessment)
4. **Week 6:** Submit offers (20-30% below market, emphasize cash + speed)
5. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate with liquidator, conduct surveys (structural, environmental)
6. **Weeks 11-14:** Legal completion (fast-track conveyancing)
7. **Months 4-12:** Apply for planning consent OR sell immediately to developer as-is
8. **Exit Strategy A:** Sell with planning at £400k-£600k (£250k-£450k profit)
9. **Exit Strategy B:** Flip as-is to developer at £250k-£300k (£100k-£150k profit, faster)

---

## Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition - Low-Rise to 8-Storey

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace Development)  
**Capital Required:**
- Airspace rights purchase: £80,000-£120,000
- Planning costs: £40,000-£60,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £130,000-£200,000

**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties (urban areas, London commuter belt)

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.8
6. Number of buildings on title: is equal to 1
7. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
10. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets **structural arbitrage** - purchasing airspace rights above existing low-rise buildings rather than full property ownership. Key insight:
- Flat roofs = easier structural addition (no hip/gable complications)
- <12m height = ~3-4 storeys, significant headroom for 8-storey target
- High PTAL (4-6) = policy support for density intensification
- Freehold = single negotiation (no head lease complications)
- Single building = simpler structural assessment

**Profit Path:**
- Airspace rights £100k → Planning consent £50k → Sell airspace with consent to developer/investor → Exit at £600k-£1M → **Profit £450k-£850k per deal**
- Target 2-3 deals to reach £2M target

**Strengths:**
- **Very low capital** (airspace rights 20-40% of freehold value)
- Landowner keeps ground floor income (easier negotiation)
- High PTAL = strong planning policy support for density
- Flat roof = lower structural costs (no roof reconstruction)
- Growing strategy (housing crisis = policy push for airspace)
- Fast planning (if policy-compliant, 6-12 months)

**Limitations:**
- **Structural capacity unknown** until survey (£10k-£15k cost, risk if unsuitable)
- Party wall agreements required (neighbor complications)
- Freeholder negotiation essential (no leasehold airspace without consent)
- Fire safety regulations stringent (post-Grenfell, expensive compliance)
- Construction noise/disruption (existing occupiers may object)
- Requires specialist structural engineer and architect (£30k-£50k fees)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Weeks 1-3:** Run filter (focus on London, Reading, Slough, Brighton - high PTAL areas)
2. **Weeks 4-6:** Desktop screening (OS maps for roof type, Google Streetview for condition)
3. **Weeks 7-10:** Approach freeholders with airspace proposal (profit-share or fixed fee)
4. **Weeks 11-14:** Negotiate airspace option/purchase (£80k-£120k)
5. **Months 4-6:** Structural survey (load-bearing capacity), engage architect for scheme design
6. **Months 7-12:** Submit planning application (4-5 additional storeys citing PTAL/density policy)
7. **Months 13-15:** Upon planning approval, market airspace with consent to developers
8. **Exit:** Sell airspace rights + planning consent for £600k-£1M (no construction required)

**Alternative Exit:** JV with developer - they fund construction, you receive profit share at completion (higher profit, longer timeline)

---

## Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement Promotion

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings) + Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement Promotion)  
**Capital Required:**
- Option agreements (multiple sites): £30,000-£60,000
- Planning promotion consultancy: £40,000-£80,000
- Legals: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £80,000-£160,000

**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (edge of settlement, never sold)

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. No latest sold date: Yes
2. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes
5. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
7. Distance to nearest adopted settlement boundary (m): is less than 200
8. Distance to nearest emerging settlement boundary (m): is less than 200
9. Developed area percentage: is less than 10
10. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, National Parks]
```

**Rationale:**
This approach combines **two powerful motivation signals**:
1. **Never sold** = inherited/legacy holding (owner may not know value, estate planning motivation)
2. **Edge of settlement** = strategic land promotion opportunity (local plan inclusion potential)

Properties with "no latest sold date" pre-date Land Registry computerization (pre-1990s) or are inherited holdings. Owners often:
- Elderly, non-professional landlords
- Unaware of development value (think agricultural land prices)
- Motivated by estate planning, tax liability, or offloading burden
- No recent activity (<1 app 5 years) = passive holding

**Profit Path:**
- Secure options £40k (10 sites @ £4k each) → Promote to local authority for allocation → Sites allocated in local plan → Sell options with allocation at £150k-£300k each → **Profit £1.1M-£2.6M total**
- Or: Apply for planning post-allocation, sell with consent at £400k-£800k each (higher profit, longer timeline)

**Strengths:**
- **Hidden gems** (owners don't market, not on developer radar)
- Low EPC = additional motivation (cannot rent, needs improvement)
- Edge of settlement = natural expansion direction (planning logic)
- Patient capital strategy (2-5 year timeline, but massive returns)
- Multiple sites = portfolio diversification (not reliant on single deal)
- Option structure = minimal capital per site (£4k-£6k)

**Limitations:**
- **Very long timeline** (2-5 years for local plan allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation (local authority decision, not certain)
- Owners may be difficult to locate (unregistered, no marketing history)
- Requires planning promotion expertise (consultancy essential)
- Some sites may have issues preventing allocation (infrastructure, flood risk)
- Low volume of results (never-sold properties rare)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Months 1-3:** Run filter, identify 30-50 never-sold edge sites
2. **Months 4-6:** Land Registry searches to identify owners, approach with patient capital pitch
3. **Months 7-9:** Negotiate option agreements (£4k-£6k per site, 3-5 year term, promotion-contingent)
4. **Months 10-12:** Engage planning consultancy, prepare promotion documents (SHLAA, site assessments)
5. **Year 2:** Submit sites to local authority for SHLAA/local plan call for sites
6. **Years 2-4:** Participate in local plan process (consultations, examinations)
7. **Year 4-5:** Sites allocated in adopted local plan (value jump from £50k/acre to £300k-£500k/acre)
8. **Exit Strategy A:** Sell options with allocation to housebuilders (£150k-£300k per site)
9. **Exit Strategy B:** Apply for planning consent, sell with consent (£400k-£800k per site, adds 12-18 months)

**Target Geography:** Focus on growth areas with emerging local plans (check Planning Inspectorate for authorities in plan review)

---

## Approach E: HMO License Expiry + Low EPC Arbitrage

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 8A (HMO License Expiry) + Pattern 2A (Long Hold + Motivation)  
**Capital Required:**
- Acquisition (discounted): £150,000-£180,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £160,000-£200,000

**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties (areas with mandatory HMO licensing)

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-01-01
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
4. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
5. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
6. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
7. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
```

**Rationale:**
This approach exploits **regulatory deadline pressure** combined with **tired landlord signals**:
- **Expired HMO license** = illegal to operate (cannot rent until renewed, £1k-£3k renewal + compliance costs)
- **Low EPC (E-G)** = double regulatory pressure (cannot rent below E since 2020, improvement £5k-£50k)
- **Long hold (sold before 2010)** = 15+ years ownership, tired landlord likely
- **NOT Article 4** = can renew license if owner wants (avoids dead-end situations)

Owner's dilemma: Spend £10k-£50k (renewal + EPC improvement + compliance) OR sell and exit

**Profit Path:**
- Acquire at £170k (20-30% discount to £215k-£245k market) → Renew HMO license £2k + EPC improvement £15k-£25k → Rent as HMO (5-8% yield) OR sell as compliant HMO to investor at £280k-£320k → **Profit £68k-£113k per deal**
- Complete 18-30 deals over 3-4 years to reach £2M (volume strategy)

**Strengths:**
- **Forced action** (expired license = cannot operate legally)
- **Time pressure** (local authority enforcement risk)
- Tired landlord (15+ years ownership = may want exit)
- Low EPC = double motivation (two regulatory problems)
- Cash buyer advantage (speed = premium in distressed scenarios)
- Can operate as HMO post-purchase (income during hold period)
- Multiple exit strategies (hold for yield, flip to investor, convert to C3)

**Limitations:**
- **Limited pool** (expired licenses rare, LAs enforce renewals)
- Renewal costs reduce margin (£2k license + £15k-£25k EPC)
- Article 4 areas excluded (can't renew even if we want)
- Some HMOs may have structural/fire safety issues (survey critical)
- Local authority may not renew license (enforcement history, saturation)
- Volume strategy required (£68k-£113k profit per deal = need many deals)

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, prioritize areas with mandatory HMO licensing (London boroughs, university towns)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Contact owners directly (expired license = not marketed, off-market opportunity)
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Emphasize owner's pain: "Renewal costs £10k-£50k, enforcement risk, let us solve your problem"
4. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate purchase at 20-30% discount (owner avoids renewal costs + time)
5. **Weeks 11-14:** Legal completion (fast-track, cash buyer advantage)
6. **Months 4-6:** Renew HMO license (£2k), complete EPC improvements (£15k-£25k)
7. **Exit Strategy A:** Hold for rental yield (5-8% gross yield, £12k-£18k annual income)
8. **Exit Strategy B:** Sell to HMO investor at £280k-£320k (£68k-£113k profit, 6-month turnaround)
9. **Exit Strategy C:** Convert to C3 single dwelling if market supports (removes HMO stigma)

**Volume Approach:** Need 18-30 deals @ £68k-£113k each to reach £2M target (portfolio strategy over 3-4 years)

### Strategic Recommendations

**For Fastest Results (6-12 months):**
→ **Approach B (Liquidation)** or **E (HMO Expiry)** - strongest motivation, quickest turnaround

**For Highest Profit per Deal:**
→ **Approach A (Precedent)** or **C (Airspace)** - £450k-£1.1M per deal

**For Lowest Risk:**
→ **Approach A (Precedent)** - planning precedent reduces uncertainty

**For Capital Efficiency:**
→ **Approach D (Legacy Holdings)** - £40k-£80k deployed, £1.1M-£2.6M returns

**Diversification Strategy:**
Run **Approaches A + B in parallel** - precedent replication (long-term, high profit) + liquidation arbitrage (short-term, cash flow) to balance risk and timeline.

All approaches are empirically testable in SearchLand. Recommend running filters, analyzing result counts, and adapting thresholds based on actual market data.

### Codex_Approaches

**Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 5A Low-Rise in Tall Building Zones  
**Capital Required:** ~£180k (control via option/JV, planning, fees)  
**Expected Results:** 15-35 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Decision: is equal to Approved
3. Title address: contains "Slough"
4. Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
5. Max building height (m): is less than 12
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.8
```

**Rationale:** Mirrors the 8-storey approval by surfacing already-approved mixed-use schemes in Slough that remain low-rise (<12m) and close to rail (Crossrail/Elizabeth Line uplift). Tight title size avoids towers but supports mid-rise infill; dual use classes match the precedent.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent match in same authority
- Rail adjacency supports higher density case
- Low existing height → clear uplift story
- Approved schemes reduce planning risk

**Limitations:**
- Slough-only scope limits volume
- Some sites may already be under build
- Rail proximity may increase land cost
- Height data gaps on some titles

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Shortlist approved but unbuilt titles; run site visits for activity check.
- Approach owners with option/JV to conserve capital; anchor on precedent height/massing.
- Pre-app for height uplift referencing identical approval language.
- Secure rights to light/daylight/party wall early for 8-storey envelope.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option fee/lock-out: £60k  
- Planning/consultants (DA/DS/TA/DAS): £70k  
- Surveys/legal (topo, rights of light, legals): £30k  
- Contingency: £20k  
- **Total:** £180k (≤ £200k)


---

**Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (Cashflow Upside)**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 22A HMO Conversion  
**Capital Required:** ~£150k (direct purchase/bridge + works)  
**Expected Results:** 20-45 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
2. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Targets oversized single C3 units with poor EPC (regulation-driven motivation) and unbroken titles (no leaseholder friction). Stale planning history reduces objection risk; >2000 sqft supports 6–8 bed HMOs delivering 5–8% yield vs BTL 3–4%.

**Strengths:**
- Low acquisition friction (freehold, no leaseholds)
- EPC pressure motivates discount
- Clear HMO scale and room count viability
- Minimal planning history simplifies conversion

**Limitations:**
- Licensing/Article 4 pockets must be checked manually
- EPC F/G may imply heavier capex
- Floor area data may be missing on some records
- Local amenity space standards vary

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Map Article 4 areas; exclude manually post-export.
- Offer fast completion to EPC-stressed owners; use bridge + refurb.
- Pre-app or cert-of-lawfulness where layout stays C3→C4/Sui Generis thresholds.
- Phase works: fabric/EPC upgrade first, then HMO-specific fit-out.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Deposit/bridge costs within £200k cap: £80k  
- Refurb/HMO compliance (FD30 doors, LD2 alarms, EPC uplift): £50k  
- Professional fees/licence/planning: £10k  
- Contingency: £10k  
- **Total:** £150k (≤ £200k)


---

**Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit (Add Floors)**

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 23A Unbroken Freehold Titles + Pattern 5A Low-Rise in Tall Zones  
**Capital Required:** ~£170k (option/JV + planning)  
**Expected Results:** 12-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]
2. Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
4. Max building height (m): is less than 12
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.4
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Rationale:** Finds “shops with tops” style freeholds with no leasehold stack to block roof/airspace schemes. Low current height in rail-served zones creates a tall-building policy mismatch; clean planning history reduces precedent objections.

**Strengths:**
- Single negotiation (no leaseholders)
- Strong transit PTAL proxy → supports extra storeys
- Mixed-use income can support holding costs
- Quiet planning history = fewer constraints

**Limitations:**
- Some commercial tenants may have lease protections; review terms
- Height data can be incomplete; field validation needed
- Smaller titles limit deep footprints; stacking relies on vertical build
- Rail adjacency can trigger noise mitigation costs

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Title review for tenant break/expiry to align with build start.
- Negotiate airspace/roof rights via option; share uplift with owner to lower upfront.
- Commission massing/DS with acoustic/glazing strategy for rail noise.
- Use lightweight construction to minimize strengthening of existing frame.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- Option/airspace premium: £70k  
- Planning/massing/consultants: £60k  
- Surveys/legal (structure, title, noise): £20k  
- Contingency: £20k  
- **Total:** £170k (≤ £200k)

6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No
9. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
```
**Note:** This search should be geographically constrained to **Slough** to match the planning precedent.

**Rationale:**
This approach targets under-developed commercial or industrial sites in Slough that mirror the underlying characteristics of the 8-storey mixed-use precedent. Given the £200k capital constraint, a direct acquisition is impossible. This strategy therefore uses **Pattern 4B: Option Agreement Candidates** to secure control of a suitable site with low capital outlay.

The filters identify low-rise, under-utilized freehold properties (`Max building height < 12m`, `Developed area percentage < 50%`) near transport hubs, making them prime for high-density redevelopment. By targeting properties held for over 10 years (`Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01`) and not currently on the market, we increase the likelihood of finding a non-professional or passive owner who is more receptive to a structured option agreement. The capital is used to secure the option and fund a planning application that replicates the 8-storey precedent, creating value by obtaining consent.

**Strengths:**
- **Capital Efficiency:** Controls a multi-million-pound asset for a fraction of its value, staying within the £200k budget.
- **Precedent-Backed:** The planning strategy is de-risked by the directly comparable 8-storey approval in the same local authority.
- **Off-Market:** Targeting properties not for sale reduces competition and allows for more creative, direct-to-owner negotiation.
- **Value Creation:** Profit is generated through planning uplift, not market speculation.
- **Targeted Motivation:** Long-held, under-utilized assets often signal a passive owner who may be open to a profitable, hassle-free exit.

**Limitations:**
- **Negotiation Dependent:** Success hinges on the owner's willingness to agree to an option, which is not guaranteed.
- **Planning Risk:** While precedent is strong, planning approval is never certain and can be costly and time-consuming.
- **No Immediate Income:** The site generates no income during the option period.
- **Finder's Fee:** Identifying the ultimate beneficial owner of a company-owned property can require extra time and cost.
- **Market Fluctuation:** A market downturn could erode the Gross Development Value (GDV) and the profitability of the secured planning consent.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Source:** Execute the SearchLand query in the Slough area.
2.  **Qualify:** Shortlist the top 5-10 sites based on redevelopment potential, proximity to amenities, and ease of construction.
3.  **Approach:** Conduct title lookups to identify the freehold owner. Initiate direct, professional outreach with a clear proposal for an option agreement (e.g., 18-24 months).
4.  **Structure Deal:** Negotiate terms: a non-refundable option fee, a pre-agreed purchase price upon planning consent, and the option term.
5.  **Secure & Plan:** Sign the option agreement. Immediately instruct architects and planning consultants to prepare a full planning application for an 8-storey mixed-use scheme, leveraging the precedent.
6.  **Exit:** Once planning is granted, either:
    *   **Option A (Flip):** Sell the site with planning consent to a developer for a significant premium.
    *   **Option B (Develop):** Bring in a joint venture partner or development finance to construct the scheme.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Option Fee:** £75,000 (typically 1-3% of the agreed purchase price)
- **Planning Application Costs:** £40,000 (Architects, Planning Consultant, Council Fees, Surveys)
- **Legal Fees:** £10,000 (for structuring the option agreement)
- **Total:** **£125,000**

## Approach B: Strategic Airspace Development

**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 6A: Flat Roof + Height Headroom + Pattern 23B: No Lease Complications
**Capital Required:** £195,000 (Airspace Purchase & Pre-construction)
**Expected Results:** 10-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready):**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other, Residential Accommodation]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, National Landscapes (AONB)]
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.75
```
**Note:** This search is intended for major UK urban centres outside London (e.g., Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol) to find value.

**Rationale:**
This strategy directly targets my specialism in regulation and capital structure by focusing on **Pattern 6A: Airspace Development**. It sidesteps the high cost of land acquisition by purchasing the right to build on top of existing buildings. The £2,000,000 profit target is achieved by adding multiple floors of high-value residential units over a commercial or residential block.

The key is identifying clean, simple opportunities. The filters target freehold buildings (`Tenure: is one of [Freehold]`) with no existing leaseholders (`Number of leaseholds...: is equal to 0`). This is a critical lesson from **Pattern 23B** and `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`, as it eliminates the immense complexity of negotiating with multiple tenants/leaseholders. We look for 2-4 storey buildings (`Max building height...: is less than 15`) with flat roofs in high-demand urban areas near transport, but outside of highly restrictive conservation zones. The £200k capital is used to purchase the airspace rights and fund the initial structural assessments and architectural designs, creating a ready-to-build project.

**Strengths:**
- **Extremely Capital Efficient:** Creates a development site for a fraction of the cost of land, making the £200k budget viable for a multi-million pound scheme.
- **Reduced Complexity:** Targeting unbroken freeholds avoids negotiating with dozens of leaseholders, a common failure point for airspace projects.
- **Sustainable:** Re-uses existing structures and foundations, often viewed favorably by planning authorities.
- **High-Value Locations:** Focuses on urban centres with proven demand for residential units.
- **Regulatory Arbitrage:** Exploits the difference between the existing building's value and its potential value with added density.

**Limitations:**
- **Structural Risk:** The existing building may not be able to support additional floors without costly reinforcement. A structural survey is critical.
- **Right to Light:** Neighboring properties may have "right to light" claims that could limit the scale of the vertical extension.
- **Construction Complexity:** Building on top of an occupied building is logistically more complex and costly than a ground-up development.
- **Freeholder Negotiation:** The freeholder may have an inflated sense of the airspace's value or may not want the disruption.
- **Fire Regulation:** Adding height has significant implications for fire strategy (e.g., second staircases) that must be solved at the design stage.

**Implementation Strategy:**
1.  **Source:** Execute the SearchLand query across several major UK cities (e.g., Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, Birmingham).
2.  **Desktop Diligence:** Prioritize targets based on location, existing building form, and apparent simplicity of adding massing. Use Google Street View to visually inspect the properties.
3.  **Approach Freeholder:** Make a direct approach to the identified freeholder with a proposal to purchase the airspace, conditional on a satisfactory structural survey.
4.  **Technical Assessment:** Upon agreement, conduct a full structural survey to confirm load-bearing capacity. Commission architects to produce feasibility designs for adding 3-5 storeys.
5.  **Acquire & Plan:** Purchase the airspace rights. Submit a detailed planning application for the vertical extension.
6.  **Exit/Develop:** Once consent is granted, the value is crystallized. The options are:
    *   **Sell:** Sell the project (airspace + consent) to a specialist developer.
    *   **JV/Finance:** Secure development finance or a JV partner to fund construction, retaining a significant portion of the £2M+ profit.

**Capital Breakdown:**
- **Airspace Rights Purchase:** £120,000 (negotiable, depends on location and number of units)
- **Structural Engineering Survey & Report:** £15,000
- **Architectural & Planning Consultant Fees:** £50,000
- **Legal Fees:** £10,000
- **Total:** **£195,000**

### Grok_Approaches

### Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 1A: Expired/Stalled Planning (adapted for precedent analysis)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000 (acquisition) + £50,000 (planning/legals) = £200,000 total  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 50
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Rationale:**
This approach targets sites with similar planning precedents to the approved 8-storey mixed-use development in Slough, focusing on stalled or expired planning applications for tall mixed-use buildings. By replicating the successful Slough approval, we identify opportunities where planning work has been done but development stalled, allowing us to revive or adapt existing consents. The capital fits within £200k by focusing on undervalued sites with partial planning derisking, potentially yielding £2M profit through quick planning approval and sale to housebuilders.

**Strengths:**
- Direct precedent matching reduces planning risk
- Targets sites with existing development intent (max dwellings >50)
- Low capital entry via stalled projects
- Transport proximity enhances viability

**Limitations:**
- Limited to sites with similar proposal keywords
- May require planning amendments for exact replication
- Geographic concentration around Slough-like areas
- Inactive buildings may need demolition

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Run filters to identify 10-30 sites with mixed-use planning precedents
2. Verify planning history via local authority searches for similar approvals
3. Approach owners with precedent evidence from Slough approval
4. Secure option agreements (£10k-£20k) to control sites
5. Apply for planning extensions or minor amendments using Slough as case law
6. Develop or sell to housebuilder at planning stage for £2M+ profit

### Approach B: Fresh Planning Consent Arbitrage
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 13A: Fresh Planning Consents  
**Capital Required:** £50,000 (options on multiple sites) + £150,000 (acquisition of winner) = £200,000 total  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Last application submitted: is after 2025-11-15
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
```

**Rationale:**
This time-sensitive approach exploits information arbitrage by targeting properties with very recent planning approvals (within 24-48 hours of SearchLand refresh), where owners may not yet realize the increased value. Unlike precedent-based strategies, this focuses on fresh consents across various development types, capitalizing on first-mover advantage before market awareness. With £200k capital, we can option multiple sites (£5k-£10k each) and acquire the best one, aiming for £2M profit by flipping at informed market value.

**Strengths:**
- Information asymmetry advantage (owners unaware of value jump)
- Broad applicability beyond specific precedents
- Low per-site capital commitment via options
- Fast execution (24-48 hour window)

**Limitations:**
- Requires daily monitoring of SearchLand refreshes
- Competition from other first-movers
- Fresh consents may still face appeals or conditions
- Geographic spread may increase due diligence costs

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Monitor SearchLand daily for new approvals (last application submitted filter)
2. Identify 20-50 sites with recent consents and contact owners immediately
3. Secure option agreements (£5k-£10k) on promising sites to lock in pre-market pricing
4. Select and acquire the strongest opportunity within £150k
5. Hold or sell quickly at market value, capturing £2M profit from arbitrage
6. Repeat process with remaining option capital for volume

### Approach C: HMO License Deadline Exploitation
**Strategic Pattern:** Pattern 8A: HMO Expired Licenses  
**Capital Required:** £180,000 (acquisition) + £20,000 (license renewal/conversion) = £200,000 total  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**SearchLand AI Prompt:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-24
3. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
5. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
```

**Rationale:**
This regulation-driven approach targets HMOs with expired licenses, creating forced seller motivation as properties cannot legally operate. Unlike planning precedents, this exploits regulatory deadlines for quick acquisitions at discounted prices. With £200k capital, we can buy distressed HMOs, renew licenses cheaply (£1k-£3k), and convert/hold for rental income or sell at market value, achieving £2M profit through volume and yield.

**Strengths:**
- Strong motivation (cannot operate without renewal)
- On-market listings ensure immediate availability
- Low capital for distressed assets
- Transport proximity supports HMO demand

**Limitations:**
- Limited to HMO-specific properties
- May require compliance work before operation
- Geographic restrictions in Article 4 areas
- Competition from other HMO operators

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Filter for expired HMO licenses and review 15-40 active listings
2. Approach owners with renewal offers or direct purchase proposals
3. Acquire distressed HMOs within £180k budget
4. Renew licenses and perform basic improvements with £20k
5. Convert to optimized HMO or hold for 5-8% yield, exiting for £2M profit
6. Scale by targeting multiple licenses in parallel

## CRITICAL FINDINGS (2025-01-19)

### ❌ Filters That DON'T Exist:

1. **"Planning Status: Expired/Lapsed"** - Major issue for Filter 2
2. **"Listed for >12 months"** - Can't directly filter stale listings
3. **"Price reduced"** - Can't directly filter motivated sellers
4. **"Tall Building Policy Zone"** - Must know geography manually
5. **"Housing Delivery Test results"** - Must research separately

### ⚠️ Unit Mismatches:

1. **Title area** = ACRES only (not sqmt)
   - 800 sqmt = 0.198 acres
   - 2,500 sqmt = 0.618 acres

2. **Building areas** = Square FEET (not sqmt)
   - Must convert: 1 sqft = 0.0929 sqm
   - Or: 1 sqm = 10.764 sqft

3. **Distances** = Metres ✓ (correct)
4. **Height** = Metres ✓ (correct)

### ✓ Filters That DO Exist (Good News):

1. Proposal (keyword search) ✓
2. Max building height (m) ✓
3. PTAL levels ✓
4. Last application submitted (date range) ✓
5. Building status (derelict, inactive, construction) ✓
6. Latest sold date ✓
7. EPC ratings ✓
8. Sales listing status ✓
9. Use class ✓
10. Ownership type ✓

---

## Workarounds for Missing Filters:

### For "Expired Planning":
Use combination of:
- Last application submitted: >2 years ago
- Proposal: contains keywords
- Max dwellings applied for: >0
- Building on title is inactive (proxy for stalled development)

### For "Listed >12 months":
- Manual screening required
- OR use "Sales listing status: Available" + old "Latest sold date"
- Imperfect proxy

### For "Tall Building Policy":
- Must research local policies manually
- Filter by specific boroughs/authorities
- Use PTAL as proxy (high PTAL areas more likely to support tall buildings)

### For "Housing Delivery Test":
- Research HDT results separately
- Filter by specific local authorities that failed
- Not directly filterable in SearchLand

## REFERENCE: LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

# SearchLand AI Implementation Learnings Database

**Purpose:** Universal, reusable knowledge about how SearchLand AI actually implements filters
**Scope:** Technical implementation details, NOT geography-specific results
**Status:** Living document - update after each project discovers new behaviors. If the filter value is not document you can make some assumption about it's expected behaviour and create a filter based on that. We will test your assumption and document any discrepancies here. 

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: List-Based Filter Operators (MOST COMMON ERROR)

**ISSUE:** LLMs frequently write invalid syntax for filters with predefined value lists (Use class, Property type, etc.)

### The Problem

SearchLand filters with **predefined value lists** (shown as checkboxes in UI) use specific operators:
- `contains any` (OR logic - matches if ANY value is present)
- `contains all` (AND logic - requires ALL values)
- `does not contain` (exclusion)
- `is equal to` (exact match)

**You CANNOT use boolean operators (`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`) within a single filter line.**

### ❌ INVALID Examples (DO NOT USE):

```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'Mixed'
   // SearchLand does not support OR operators within a filter line

❌ Use class: contains 'E' AND Use class: contains 'C3'
   // SearchLand does not support AND operators within a filter line

❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
   // Wrong syntax - no OR operators

❌ Use class: E AND C3
   // Wrong syntax - no AND operators
```

**Why This Fails:**
- SearchLand's AI prompt parser does not recognize `OR`/`AND`/`NOT` as operators
- It treats the entire string as a literal search term
- The filter will return zero results or unexpected matches

### ✅ CORRECT Examples:

```
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Multiple values in single filter with "contains any" operator
   // This matches properties with EITHER E OR C3 (implicit OR)

✅ Use class: contains all [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
   // Correct: Requires BOTH E AND C3 to be present (implicit AND)

✅ Use class: does not contain [B2 - General industrial]
   // Correct: Excludes properties with B2 use class

✅ Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use, Residential]
   // Correct: Matches any of these property types

✅ Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
   // Correct: Exact match for single value
```

### List-Based Filters (Use operators above):
- **Use class** - Planning use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Property type** - Commercial, Residential, Mixed Use, etc.
- **Property classification** - Separate taxonomy from Use class
- **Tenure** - Freehold, Leasehold, etc.
- **Ownership type** - Corporate, Individual, etc.
- **Any filter showing checkbox options in UI**

### Syntax Pattern:

```
[Filter name]: [operator] [comma-separated list of values in square brackets]
```

**Examples:**
```
Use class: contains any [E, C3, C4]
Property type: does not contain [Agricultural]
Tenure: is equal to [Freehold]
```

### Common Corrections:

| ❌ Incorrect | ✅ Correct |
|-------------|-----------|
| `Use class: contains 'E' OR 'C3'` | `Use class: contains any [E, C3]` |
| `Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Mixed'` | `Property type: contains any [Commercial, Mixed Use]` |
| `Use class: NOT 'B2'` | `Use class: does not contain [B2]` |
| `Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'` | `Tenure: contains any [Freehold, Leasehold]` |

---

## Filter Syntax & Boolean Logic

### ✅ What Works

**Text Search - AND Logic:**
```
Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
```
- SearchLand AI supports AND within a single text field
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching (e.g., "storey" matches "8-storey", "multi-storey")

**Numeric - Compound Ranges:**
```
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
```
- Supports AND for numeric ranges in single filter line
- Creates inclusive lower bound, exclusive upper bound by default

**Enum - Multiple Selection:**
```
TFL Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL): is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b
```
- Accepts comma-separated list for enum fields
- Must use exact values from dropdown (case-sensitive)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**OR Logic in Single Filter:**
```
❌ Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes OR Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
```
- SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line
- **Workaround:** Create separate filter groups with OR relationship at group level

**Boolean Operators in List-Based Filters:**
```
❌ Use class: contains 'E' OR Use class: contains 'C3'
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
```
- List-based filters do NOT support `OR`, `AND`, `NOT` operators within a single filter line
- **Correct:** `Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]`
- Use `contains any` for OR logic, `contains all` for AND logic

**Non-existent Filters:**
```
❌ Planning Status: is equal to "Expired"
❌ Price reduced: is equal to Yes
❌ Listed for more than 12 months: is equal to Yes
```
- These filters do NOT exist in SearchLand (verified 2025-01-19)
- **Workarounds:** Use proxy combinations (see Filter Patterns section)

---

## Unit Conventions (CRITICAL)

### Area Measurements

**Title Area - ACRES ONLY:**
```
✅ Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2
❌ Title area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Building Areas - SQUARE FEET ONLY:**
```
✅ Developed area (sqft): is greater than 10000
❌ Developed area (sqm): [DOES NOT EXIST]
```

**Conversion Reference:**
```
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
0.2 acres = 8,712 sqft = 809 sqm
0.5 acres = 21,780 sqft = 2,023 sqm
1 acre = 43,560 sqft = 4,047 sqm
2 acres = 87,120 sqft = 8,094 sqm

Common building sizes:
8,000 sqft = 743 sqm = 0.18 acres
10,000 sqft = 929 sqm = 0.23 acres
50,000 sqft = 4,645 sqm = 1.15 acres
100,000 sqft = 9,290 sqm = 2.30 acres
```

### Height & Distance - METRES

```
✅ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 15
✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
```

**Height Reference:**
```
Typical storey height: 3-4m per storey
8-storey building: 24-32m (typically 25-30m to roof)
12m max height: ~3-4 storeys
15m max height: ~4-5 storeys
25m max height: ~7-9 storeys
```

**Building Height - Auto-Conversion Behavior ⚠️**
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
SearchLand AI may auto-convert between height metrics:
- "Max building height on title (m): is less than 12" 
  → May create "Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4"
- Conversion assumes ~3m per floor
- Both filters exist separately in SearchLand

Available Height Filters:
✅ Max building height on title (m) - absolute height in metres
✅ Max number of building floors on title - storey count
✅ Number of building floors in title - actual floor count

RECOMMENDATION:
- If you want floors, specify floors (more reliable parsing)
- If you want metres, specify metres (but verify which filter was created)
- Always check SearchLand UI to confirm which filter was applied

Example:
# If you want 3-4 storey buildings:
✅ Max number of building floors on title: is less than 4  (explicit, reliable)
⚠️ Max building height on title (m): is less than 12  (may auto-convert to floors)

Conversion Reference:
12m ≈ 3-4 floors
15m ≈ 4-5 floors  
18m ≈ 5-6 floors
25m ≈ 7-9 floors
(Assumes 3-4m per storey)
```

---

## Filter Interpretation & Behavior

### "Building on title is inactive"
```
Includes:
- Derelict buildings
- Abandoned structures
- Not currently in use
- May include: Buildings under construction (varies)

Does NOT include:
- Occupied buildings with no recent activity
- Vacant land with no building
```

### "Applications in the last 5 years"
```
Behavior:
- Counts ALL application types (approved, refused, withdrawn, pending)
- Includes amendments to existing permissions
- "= 0" means ZERO applications (very restrictive)

Typical results by strictness:
- "= 0": Extremely restrictive (often 0-5 results per LPA)
- "< 3": Moderately restrictive
- "< 5": Broader search
```

### "Sales listing currently on the market"
```
Shows ONLY:
- Live Rightmove listings
- Current asking prices

Does NOT show:
- Off-market properties
- Withdrawn listings
- Expired listings
- Properties marketed on other platforms only

For off-market opportunities: Use "Latest sold date" filters instead
```

### "Proposal" Text Search
```
Behavior:
- Searches planning application proposal descriptions
- Partial matching (e.g., "mixed" matches "mixed-use")
- Case-insensitive
- Matches across entire proposal text

Best practices:
- Use specific keywords: "storey", "mixed-use", "residential"
- Avoid overly generic terms: "development", "construction"
- Combine multiple keywords with AND for precision
```

### "Latest sold date" vs "Sales listing price"
```
"Latest sold date": 
- Historical transaction data
- Includes off-market sales
- Good proxy for corporate ownership length

"Sales listing price":
- Current market listings ONLY
- Requires "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes"
- Excludes off-market opportunities
```

### "Ownership type: Company"
```
Behavior:
- Identifies corporate ownership
- Excludes individual/personal ownership
- Good indicator for:
  - Institutional sellers
  - Portfolio divestment opportunities
  - Potentially motivated sellers (if held long-term)
```

### "Sui Generis" Use Class - Display Name Clarification
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

BEHAVIOR:
When you filter for "Sui Generis" use class, SearchLand displays it as:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

CLARIFICATION:
- "Outside of the defined classes" = Sui Generis
- Sui Generis = Uses that don't fit into standard use classes (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- Examples: Car showrooms, petrol stations, nightclubs, launderettes, taxi businesses, 
  scrap yards, casinos, theatres, amusement arcades, hostels, motor vehicle repair

Filter correctly parses when you use:
✅ Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, Sui Generis]

Display in SearchLand UI:
"Use class contains any: E - Commercial, Business and Se... , Outside of the defined classes"

Note: This is just a display difference - the filter works correctly.
```

### "Company status" ⚠️ STRONG MOTIVATION SIGNAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (User: ashsubband)

Available values include:
- Active (normal trading company)
- Liquidation ⚠️ VERY STRONG motivation signal
- Dissolved
- In Administration
- [Other statuses - see SearchLand dropdown]

CRITICAL INSIGHT:
"Company status: is one of Liquidation" = FORCED SALE scenario
- Company legally obligated to sell assets
- Liquidator motivated to complete quickly
- Often discounted pricing
- Strong negotiating position for buyer

Usage Example:
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of Liquidation
3. [Additional filters for property type/size]

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few results)
- Very strong motivation signal (forced sale)
- Excellent for negotiating favorable terms

Combine with:
- Derelict/inactive buildings (double motivation)
- Long hold period (non-core asset)
- Price caps (realistic expectations)

Related: See FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)

## Motivation Signals (from SearchLand Presets Analysis)

### "HMO License Expiry Date" ⚠️ REGULATION-DRIVEN MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #12, #35, #47)

REGULATION = FORCED ACTION:
- Expired HMO license = illegal to operate
- Owner must: Renew (expensive £1k-£3k + compliance) OR Sell (motivated)
- Renewal requires: Safety certs, planning compliance, local authority approval
- Some areas have Article 4 restrictions (can't renew)

Usage Examples:
Preset #12: HMO Expired Licenses
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: before [current date]
3. Freehold tenure

Preset #47: HMO Opportunities (conversion)
1. 8-12 habitable rooms
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Latest sold date: before [10+ years ago]
4. Low EPC (motivation signal)

Performance:
- Highly targeted (few properties per LPA)
- Strong motivation (cannot operate legally)
- Time-sensitive (expiry creates urgency)

Combine with:
- Low EPC (needs work anyway)
- Long hold period (tired landlord)
- NOT Article 4 (can renew if they want)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A (Regulation-Driven)
```

### "Lease end date" ⚠️ CASH FLOW ENDING = MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #17, #41, #46, #66, #68, #78)

INCOME CLIFF = SELLER MOTIVATION:
- Lease expiring = no rental income soon
- Owner must: Find new tenant OR Sell
- Shorter timeline = stronger motivation (6-12 months most motivated)

Usage Examples:
Preset #17: Commercial Expiring Leases
1. B2/B8/E use class
2. Lease end date: before 31/12/2026
3. Last application: before 01/09/2020 (stale property)

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring
1. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (1 year window)
2. 6,000+ daily footfall (prime location)
3. E(a) retail

Preset #68: Offices No C3 No Lease
1. E(g)(i) offices
2. NOT C3 (can convert)
3. Lease ended OR no leaseholds (vacant)

Performance:
- Moderate targeting (varies by market)
- Timing matters (6-12 months optimal)
- Vacant = strongest signal (already no income)

Combine with:
- Long hold period (owner wants out)
- Low EPC (needs refurb)
- Stale planning (no recent activity)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry Opportunities)
```

### "EPC rating" (Low) ⚠️ IMPROVEMENT/REGULATION MOTIVATION
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69)

LOW EPC = FORCED INVESTMENT OR SALE:
- EPC E-G = below regulations (private rented: min E from 2020)
- Cannot legally rent until improved
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property
- Owner must: Spend money OR Sell

Usage Examples:
Preset #2: Run Down Homes
1. EPC: G, E, F, D
2. C3 dwellinghouses only
3. Less than 30% developed (land value)
4. Detached (more improvement potential)

Preset #20: Unsold Poor EPC
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. Latest sold date: before 01/07/2004 (20+ year hold!)
3. Private owner

Preset #36: ECO4 Solar Install
1. EPC: E, F, G
2. 5+ addresses (multi-unit)
3. Private owner (eligible for ECO4 grants)

Preset #67: Offices Low EPC
1. EPC: D, E, F, G
2. E commercial use
3. Office type

Performance:
- Very broad (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- G/F = strongest motivation (cannot rent)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- No recent sales
- Private owner (not professional landlord)

Insight: E-G for rental = illegal, D = borderline, improvement required

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8C (EPC Compliance Opportunities)
```

### "No latest sold date" ⚠️ NEVER SOLD = VERY LONG HOLD
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #69)

NEVER SOLD = INHERITED/LEGACY HOLDING:
- Property never transacted in Land Registry records
- Likely: Inherited, family land, very old ownership
- Motivation: Non-professional owner, may not know value, estate planning

Usage Examples:
Preset #18: Edge of Settlement
1. No latest sold date
2. Private owner
3. Edge of settlement (land promotion opportunity)
4. Less than 1 application in 5 years (no activity)

Preset #69: Older Houses Outdoor Space
1. No latest sold date
2. Less than 1 application in 5 years
3. Private owner
4. Low EPC (E, F, G)
5. 1,000-4,500 sqmt (large plot)

Performance:
- Rare signal (only pre-LR computerization or inheritance)
- Very strong for land opportunities
- Often unexpected motivation (estate planning, downsizing)

Combine with:
- Low activity (no planning apps)
- Edge of settlement (promotion opportunity)
- Large plot (infill potential)
- Private owner (not professional)

Insight: These are "hidden gems" - owners may not be actively marketing

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2E (Never-Sold Legacy Holdings)
```

### "Less than 1 application in last 5 years" ⚠️ NO ACTIVITY = STALE
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #18, #29, #47, #69, #77)

NO PLANNING ACTIVITY = STALE/PASSIVE OWNER:
- No planning applications for 5+ years
- Owner not actively developing
- May indicate: Tired landlord, passive holding, wants out

Usage Examples:
Preset #29: Car Parks
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. Car park use class
3. Less than 5% developed

Preset #77: Shops with Tops
1. Less than 1 application in last 5 years
2. E/E(a)/E(b) commercial ground floor
3. 6m+ building height (airspace potential)

Performance:
- Broad filter (many properties)
- Must combine with other signals
- Indicates passive/unmotivated owner (not developer)

Combine with:
- Long hold period
- Low EPC
- Expired leases
- No recent sales

Opposite: "Applications in last 5 years > 3" = ACTIVE developer (less motivated to sell)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 2F (Stale/Passive Holdings)
```

### "Hardstanding percentage" ⚠️ PROXY FOR "PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED"
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #7, #15, #37, #43, #44, #61)

HARDSTANDING = BROWNFIELD/GREY BELT EXCEPTION:
- Hard surfaces: Concrete, asphalt, paving
- >10-30% hardstanding = "previously developed land"
- Green Belt exception: Previously developed can be redeveloped
- Planning easier on brownfield than greenfield

Usage Examples:
Preset #7: Grey Belt
1. 25%+ area developed
2. 10%+ hardstanding
3. Green Belt location
4. Within 100m built-up area
→ Exception: Previously developed in Green Belt

Preset #15: Brownfield Industrial
1. 30%+ hardstanding
2. <10% developed (building demolished but base remains)
3. Industrial use

Preset #61: EV Charger Multi-Address
1. 40%+ hardstanding (car parks/driveways)
2. 75+ addresses (flats)

Performance:
- Clever workaround for Green Belt
- Indicates previous use (less "green" objection)
- Often cheaper than pure greenfield

Thresholds:
- 10% = Minimal (edge case)
- 25-30% = Clear previously developed status
- 40%+ = Significant infrastructure (car parks)

Combine with:
- Green Belt location
- Proximity to built-up area
- Low/no building (demolished but base remains)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A (Grey Belt Workarounds)
```

### "Agricultural Land Grade" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT SUITABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #39, #51, #52, #56, #81)

AGRICULTURAL GRADE = ENERGY PROJECT VIABILITY:
- Grade 1-2: Best & Most Versatile (BMV) - avoid (planning objection)
- Grade 3a: BMV - marginal (avoid if possible)
- Grade 3b, 4, 5: Lower quality - PREFERRED for solar/wind
- Non-agricultural/Urban: Also acceptable

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (note: excludes Grade 1-2)
2. 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres)
3. Within 2km green rated substation

Preset #39: Nutrient Neutrality Farmland
1. NOT Grade 1 or 2 (avoids BMV objection)
2. 80,000+ sqmt (20 acres)
3. Cereal crops (easy to work with)
4. Nutrient neutrality area (special opportunity)

Performance:
- Grade 3b/4 = optimal for energy projects
- Grade 1-2 = planning refusal risk
- Grade 3a = borderline (case-by-case)

Insight: Solar/wind planners specifically target Grade 3b/4 to avoid BMV objections

Combine with:
- Proximity to substation (< 2km)
- Large acreage (40,000+ sqmt for solar)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Away from residential (wind)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A (Renewable Energy Land)
```

### "SHLAA Status" 💡 STRATEGIC LAND INDICATOR
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #38, #43, #85)

SHLAA = Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessment:
- Positive/Neutral = Local authority identified as developable
- Negative = Identified but rejected
- No SHLAA = Not assessed (hidden opportunity OR too constrained)

Usage Examples:
Preset #38: Emerging Sites No Planning
1. Housing allocation (emerging) - IN LOCAL PLAN
2. <1 max dwellings applied for (no planning yet)
3. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
→ Strategy: Get planning before allocation adopted (first mover)

Preset #85: Un-Allocated No SHLAA 1-10 Acres
1. NOT positive/neutral/negative SHLAA (not assessed)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m settlement boundary
→ Strategy: Promote to local authority (no one else looking)

Performance:
- SHLAA positive = easier planning (authority support)
- No SHLAA + edge of settlement = promotion opportunity
- Negative SHLAA = understand WHY before pursuing

Strategic Insight:
- Un-assessed sites near settlements = hidden gems
- Emerging allocations = get planning before competition

Combine with:
- Edge of settlement proximity
- No recent planning applications
- Private ownership (easier to deal)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A (Strategic Land Promotion)
```

### "SIC Codes" 💡 INDUSTRY TARGETING
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #71, #73, #83)

SIC = Standard Industrial Classification:
- UK company registration codes
- Target specific industries for outreach
- Solar/energy particularly effective

Usage Examples:
Preset #71: Paper Manufacturers (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 18110, 58130, 58110, etc. (paper/printing)
2. 5,000+ sqmt
3. Freehold, no leaseholds
→ Large roofs, high energy use, solar saves money

Preset #73: Poultry Farms (Solar Outreach)
1. SIC codes: 01470 (poultry), 10130, 10120 (processing)
2. Private/company ownership
→ Large barns, steady energy demand

Preset #83: Manufacturing Owner-Occupier (Solar)
1. Extensive list of manufacturing SIC codes
2. B2/E(g)(iii) use class
3. 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied)
→ High energy users, own roof space

Performance:
- Highly targeted industry outreach
- Solar: Target high-energy users with large roofs
- Owner-occupied = decision maker accessible

Strategic Insight:
- Manufacturing = high energy bills = solar ROI compelling
- Owner-occupied (no leaseholds) = easier than landlord/tenant

Target Industries for Solar:
- Paper/printing (high energy)
- Poultry (continuous heating)
- Manufacturing (machinery)
- Warehousing (large roofs)

Combine with:
- Flat roofs (easier solar install)
- Freehold, no leases (owner control)
- Large buildings (economies of scale)

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10B (Industry-Targeted Solar)
```

### "Footfall / Vehicle Count" 💡 COMMERCIAL VIABILITY
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72, #84)

TRAFFIC = COMMERCIAL REVENUE POTENTIAL:
- High footfall = retail viability
- High vehicle count = drive-thru, petrol station, EV charger viability
- Quantified thresholds from presets

Usage Examples:
Preset #27: Cafe & Restaurant Sites
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display use
3. 325+ sqmt

Preset #46: High Footfall Retail Expiring Leases
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (very high)
2. Lease expiring (motivation)
→ Prime location, landlord motivated

Preset #54: EV Charging Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m A road
3. Within 5km green rated substation

Preset #72: Petrol Station Sites
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. 15,000-60,000 sqmt
3. Aged 25-64 demographics

Performance Thresholds:
- 800+ footfall = viable for cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = viable for petrol/EV/drive-thru

Strategic Insight:
- Traffic counts validate commercial viability
- Higher = higher rents/profits possible
- Essential for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers

Combine with:
- Proximity to major roads
- Commercial use class
- Expiring leases (motivation)
- EV: Proximity to substation

Related: FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A (Traffic-Dependent Commercial)
```

### "Distance to Substation" 💡 ENERGY PROJECT CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-19 (Source: Presets #14, #51, #52, #53, #54, #55, #56, #81, #84)

SUBSTATION PROXIMITY = GRID CONNECTION VIABILITY:
- Green rated = capacity available (preferred)
- Amber/Red rated = constrained (avoid or expensive)
- Distance thresholds vary by project type

Usage Examples:
Preset #14: Solar Ground Mount
1. Within 2,000m (2km) green rated substation
2. 40,000+ sqmt land
3. Agricultural Grade 3b/4

Preset #51: BESS (Battery Storage)
1. Within 2,000m green rated substation
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt

Preset #55: Hydrogen Sites
1. Within 200m of substation (very close!)
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Away from sensitive uses (500m+ from schools/hospitals)

Preset #53: Data Centers
1. Within 2,000m substation
2. 60,000+ sqmt
3. Flat terrain

Distance Thresholds by Use:
- Solar/Wind/BESS: <2,000m (2km) acceptable
- Hydrogen: <200m (very close - high power demand)
- EV Chargers: <5,000m (5km) workable
- Data Centers: <2,000m

Insight: "Green rated" substation filter exists and is CRITICAL
- Green = capacity available now
- Connection costs increase exponentially with distance

Combine with:
- Large acreage (energy projects)
- Flat terrain (solar preferred)
- Agricultural Grade 3b/4 (avoid planning objections)
- Away from residential (wind, hydrogen)

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall #1: Over-Constraining Filters
```
Problem:
- Combining many restrictive filters compounds to zero results
- Example: "Applications = 0" AND "Price < £200k" AND "Inactive" AND "On market"

Solution:
- Test filters incrementally
- Start broad, narrow iteratively
- Consider multiple strategies vs one perfect filter
```

### Pitfall #2: Assuming Unit Availability
```
Problem:
- Assuming sqm filters exist (they don't)
- Using wrong units causes filter failure

Solution:
- ALWAYS check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
- Use conversion reference above
- Default to acres/sqft/metres
```

### Pitfall #3: Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem:
- Using "Planning Status: Expired" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Price reduced" (doesn't exist)
- Using "Listed >12 months" (doesn't exist)

Solution:
- Use proxy filter combinations
- See FILTER_PATTERNS.md for proven workarounds
```

### Pitfall #4: Misunderstanding PTAL Geography
```
Problem:
- PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level) only covers London/TfL area
- Filter returns 0 results outside London

Solution:
- Only use PTAL for London-based searches
- For UK-wide: Use "Distance to nearest Train Station" instead
```

---

## Proxy Filter Strategies

### Expired Planning Permission (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Last application submitted: is before [3+ years ago]
2. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0
4. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes

Rationale: Targets sites with old planning, no recent activity, inactive status
```

### Motivated Seller (No Direct Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
1. Latest sold date: is before [5+ years ago] (long hold period)
2. Ownership type: is equal to Company (institutional)
3. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes (asset write-down)
4. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes (active sale)

Rationale: Corporate holding derelict asset for 5+ years likely motivated
```

### Long-Listed Property (No "Listed >12 months" Filter)
```
Proxy Combination:
Not directly achievable in SearchLand
Requires: Manual screening of "Sales listing currently on the market"
Workaround: Use broad filters, export results, screen externally
```

---

## Filter Performance Observations

### Highly Restrictive Filters (Often 0-10 results)
- `Applications in the last 5 years: is equal to 0`
- `Sales listing price: is less than 200000` (UK-wide)
- `Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes` (combined with price caps)

### Moderately Selective (10-100 results)
- `PTAL: is one of 4, 5, 6a, 6b` (London only)
- `Latest sold date: is before 2020-01-19`
- `Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 2`

### Broad Filters (100+ results)
- `Proposal: contains "mixed-use"`
- `Max building height on title (m): is less than 12`
- `Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000`

**Note:** These are general observations. Actual results vary significantly by LPA/geography.

## SearchLand AI Parsing Quirks

### Complex Multi-Line Prompts May Be Partially Ignored ⚠️ CRITICAL
```
Discovered: 2025-11-24 (Project: MixedUse-8Storey-2M-v20, Approach E)

ISSUE:
- When providing 8+ filter lines in a single prompt, SearchLand AI may only parse 2-3 filters
- More complex the prompt structure, higher the failure rate
- No clear pattern for which filters get dropped
- Can result in massively inflated result counts (e.g., 25,910 instead of 10-50)

Example Failure:
Prompt with 8 filters → Only 2 created (Max floors, Tenure auto-added)
Missing: Distance to station, title area, use class, sold date, applications, on market

SOLUTION:
1. **Simplify prompt structure:**
   - Separate compound AND conditions into individual lines
   - Avoid mixing multiple filter types in rapid sequence
   
2. **Break into smaller chunks:**
   - Start with 4-5 filters, verify they parse
   - Add remaining filters manually in UI if needed
   
3. **Always verify before clicking Search:**
   - Count filters created vs filters requested
   - Check filter names match what you asked for
   - Add missing filters manually using "Add Filter" button

Success Pattern (Iteration 2):
- Split "is greater than X AND less than Y" into two separate lines
- Used simpler filter names (e.g., "floors" instead of "height in metres")
- Result: 8/8 filters successfully parsed

Related: See "Multiple AND Conditions" section below
```

### Multiple AND Conditions
```
✅ Works: "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2"
✅ Works: "Proposal: contains 'mixed' AND 'storey'"
❌ Limited: Cannot chain 3+ AND conditions reliably

RELIABILITY TIP (Discovered 2025-11-24):
While AND works in simple prompts, complex prompts (6+ filters) benefit from splitting:

❌ Less Reliable (in complex prompts):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5

✅ More Reliable (always parses):
Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25
Title area (acres): is less than 1.5

WHEN TO SPLIT:
- Complex prompts (6+ filters total)
- When other filters are failing to parse
- When you need guaranteed reliability

WHEN SINGLE LINE IS OK:
- Simple prompts (3-5 filters)
- When used alone or with minimal other filters
- Numeric ranges are the primary search criteria
```

### Whitespace & Special Characters
```
✅ Handles: Quotes in text search ("mixed-use")
⚠️ Sensitive: Extra whitespace may affect parsing
❌ Avoid: Special regex characters (*, ?, [, ])
```

### Filter Ordering
```
Observation: Filter order doesn't affect results
Best practice: Order logically (most selective first) for readability
```

## Contributing Guidelines

### ⚠️ THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT - UPDATE IT!

**Philosophy:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md is **NOT fixed** - it's **cumulative and adaptive**. Every project should add to it.

### When to add entries:

**MUST ADD:**
- ✅ Discovered new SearchLand AI parsing behavior
- ✅ Found filter syntax that works/doesn't work  
- ✅ Identified implementation quirks
- ✅ Discovered new unit conventions
- ✅ Found new motivation signals (e.g., "Company status: Liquidation")
- ✅ Discovered filter value options not previously documented

**When NOT to add entries:**
- ❌ Geography-specific result counts (e.g., "10 results in Slough")
- ❌ Project-specific strategies (goes in FILTER_PATTERNS.md instead)
- ❌ User preferences (goes in project requirements)

### How to Contribute (3 Methods):

**Method 1: During Stage 4 (Learning Capture)**
After parallel testing, review results for universal insights:
1. Did any filter behave unexpectedly?
2. Did we discover new filter values/options?
3. Did we find new motivation signals?
4. Did syntax work differently than documented?

If YES → Update this file immediately

**Method 2: Ad-Hoc Discovery (Like Today!)**
When you discover something useful while exploring SearchLand:
1. Document it in this file under appropriate section
2. Note date discovered and who found it
3. Add example filter usage
4. Link to related FILTER_PATTERNS.md if applicable

**Method 3: User Feedback**
When testing reveals reality differs from documentation:
1. Update incorrect entries
2. Add new sections for missing information
3. Mark outdated info with ⚠️ or remove it

  - Added filter comparison and recommendations
- ✅ Expanded "Multiple AND Conditions" with reliability tips
  - Complex prompts benefit from splitting AND into separate lines
- ✅ "Sui Generis" appears as "Outside of the defined classes" in UI
  - Clarified display name to prevent confusion during filter verification

**2025-11-19:**
- ✅ "Company status: Liquidation" as strong motivation signal (User: ashsubband)
  - Added to LEARNINGS_DATABASE (line 192)
  - Added Pattern 2D to FILTER_PATTERNS.md
  - Discovered via real SearchLand exploration

**2025-11-19 (System v3.0 launch):**
- ✅ Initial database population from MixedUse-8Storey-2M projects (v1, v2)

## Newly Documented Filters (v5.2.3)

### Property Type

**Context:**
- Simple residential/commercial classification (different from "Property classification")
- Only 5 values: Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial
- Used for basic property type filtering

**Operators:** `contains all`, `contains any`, `does not contain`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property type: contains any [Detached, Semi-Detached]
Property type: contains all [Commercial, Flat]  // Mixed-use commercial flats
Property type: does not contain [Terraced]
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property type: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property type: Detached AND Semi-Detached
```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Do NOT confuse with "Property classification" (which has 500+ values)

---

### Tenure

**Context:**
- Legal ownership structure
- 5 values: Leasehold, Freehold, Pending first registration, Caution against first registration, Rentcharge
- Critical for acquisition strategy (Freehold = full ownership, Leasehold = time-limited)

**Operator:** `is one of` (implicit OR)

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Leasehold, Freehold]
Tenure: is one of [Pending first registration]  // Unregistered land - potential opportunity
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Tenure: 'Freehold' OR 'Leasehold'
❌ Tenure: NOT 'Leasehold'
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Freehold only:** For long-term hold/development (no ground rent complications)
- **Leasehold:** Can indicate motivated sellers (especially short leases <80 years)
- **Pending first registration:** Unregistered land - may have title issues but also opportunities

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Combine with "Lease end date" for leasehold properties to find short leases

---

### Property Classification

**Context:**
- Comprehensive taxonomy with ~500+ values across 24 major categories
- Separate from "Use class" (planning) - this is Ordnance Survey classification
- Hierarchical: Commercial > Hotel/Motel > Youth Hostel (example)
- **CRITICAL:** Do NOT mix with "Use class" values

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**Major Categories:**
- Commercial, Education, Hotel/Motel, Industrial, Leisure, Medical, Animal Centre, Office, Broadcasting, Retail, Storage Land, Transport, Utility, Emergency/Rescue, Information, Land, Water, Military, Other, Parent Shell, Residential, Unclassified, Dual Use, Object of Interest

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Property classification: contains any [Commercial, Residential]
Property classification: contains all [Development Site, Residential Construction Site]
Property classification: does not contain [Military, Prison]
Property classification: exactly matches [Hotel/Motel]
Property classification: contains any [Vacant / Derelict Land, Development Site]  // Opportunity sites
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Property classification: 'Commercial' OR 'Residential'
❌ Property classification: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]  // WRONG - that's Use class, not classification
❌ Property classification: Development Site AND Residential  // Use 'contains all' instead
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **Development Site:** Active construction - may indicate market activity
- **Vacant / Derelict Land:** Potential redevelopment opportunities
- **Care / Nursing Home:** For care home conversion strategies
- **Hotel/Motel:** For hotel-to-residential conversions
- **Warehouse / Store / Storage Depot:** For industrial-to-residential conversions

**Performance/Notes:**
- Slower filter due to large value set - use strategically
- More granular than "Property type" but less planning-specific than "Use class"
- Can combine with "Use class" for precision (e.g., Classification: Hotel + Use class: C3 for converted hotels)

### PTAL (Public Transport Accessibility Level)

**Context:**
- London-specific metric (Transport for London)
- 9 values: 0 (Worst), 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)
- Higher = better public transport access = higher land values + planning support for density
- **CRITICAL:** Only available in London - will return zero results elsewhere

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`, `exactly matches`

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
PTAL: contains any [6a, 6b (Best)]  // Excellent transport - supports tall buildings
PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]  // Good to excellent
PTAL: does not contain [0 (Worst), 1a, 1b]  // Exclude poor transport areas
PTAL: exactly matches [6b (Best)]  // Only the very best
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ PTAL: '6a' OR '6b'
❌ PTAL: is greater than 4  // Not a numeric filter - use 'contains any' with list
❌ PTAL: High  // Must use exact values (0, 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6a, 6b)
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**
- **High-density development:** PTAL 4+ supports planning for tall buildings
- **Residential demand:** PTAL 5+ = premium pricing for car-free living
- **Planning policy:** Many London boroughs require PTAL 3+ for car-free developments
- **Opportunity:** PTAL 2-3 areas with planned transport improvements (check TfL plans)

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- **London only** - always combine with London geography filters
- Use with "Distance to nearest Train Station" for non-London areas
- PTAL ratings can change - check TfL website for planned improvements

**Related Filters:**
- Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - for non-London areas
- Distance to nearest Bus Stop (m)
- Distance to nearest Rapid Transit Stop/Station (m)

### Planning Constraints

**Context:**
- 34 constraint types covering environmental, heritage, policy, and flood risk
- Critical for assessing development viability
- Some are absolute blockers (Green Belt, SSSI), others provide policy support (Housing Zones)
- **IMPORTANT:** "Built up areas" is POSITIVE (urban context), not a constraint to avoid

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (34 constraints)
- **Absolute Blockers:** Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, World heritage sites, Scheduled Monuments, National Parks, National Landscapes (AONB)
- **Flood Risk:** Flood Zone 2 (negotiable), Flood Zone 3 (major blocker)
- **Policy Support (SEEK):** Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas, Areas Of Intensification, Site Allocations, Built up areas
- **Heritage:** Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer (less restrictive), Parks and Gardens, Battlefields
- **Environmental:** SAC, SPA, RAMSAR, National Nature Reserves, Local Nature Reserves, Country Parks, CROW
- **Urban Planning:** Central Activities Zone (London), SIL, LSIS, Town Center Boundaries, Designated Open Space
- **Other:** Tree Preservation Order (TPO), Nutrient Neutrality

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]  // Avoid major blockers
Planning constraints: contains any [Housing Zones, Opportunity Areas]  // Seek policy support
Planning constraints: does not contain [SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Exclude protected sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Housing Zones, Built up areas]  // Urban housing policy areas
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]  // Exclude Green Belt only
Planning constraints: contains any [Site Allocations]  // Sites allocated for development in local plan
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Planning constraints: NOT 'Green Belt'
❌ Planning constraints: 'Green Belt' OR 'Conservation Area'
❌ Planning constraints: does not contain [Built up areas]  // WRONG - Built up areas is GOOD!
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Urban Brownfield Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
   ```

2. **High-Density Development (London):**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [Central Activities Zone, Opportunity Areas]
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   PTAL: contains any [5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
   ```

3. **Avoid All Major Blockers:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, Listed Building(s) in plot]
   ```

4. **Industrial Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: contains any [SIL, LSIS]  // Strategic/Locally Significant Industrial - may be released
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
   ```

5. **Flood Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
   ```
   Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3]  // Exclude high risk
   Planning constraints: contains any [Flood Zone 2]  // Accept Zone 2 (mitigation possible)
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Use "Percentage of plot un-constrained" to find sites with minimal coverage (e.g., >80%)
- **Critical distinction:** "Built up areas" = urban context (GOOD), NOT a development blocker
- Green Belt = ~13% of England - major constraint but some brownfield exceptions exist
- Conservation Areas = ~2% of England - design restrictions, not necessarily a blocker
- Flood Zone 3 = high risk - insurance issues, planning refusal likely
- Flood Zone 2 = medium risk - mitigation measures required but achievable

**Related Filters:**
- Percentage of plot un-constrained (%) - Find sites with <20% constraint coverage
- Area of plot un-constrained (acres) - Absolute unconstrained area
- Percentage of title covered by Green Belt - Partial coverage may be workable
- Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2/3 - Assess flood risk extent

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Clean sites for quick planning
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area]
Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80

# Policy-supported urban sites
Planning constraints: contains all [Built up areas, Housing Zones]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area]

# Heritage-adjacent (not on-site)
Planning constraints: contains any [Listed Building(s) 50m Buffer]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Listed Building(s) in plot]  // Near but not on
```

### Building Use Group

**Context:**
- High-level functional classification - 17 categories
- Less granular than "Use class" (planning), more functional than "Property type"
- Good for broad filtering before applying detailed "Use class" filters
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly listed as a category (unlike in Property type)

**Operators:** `contains any`, `contains all`, `does not contain`

**Available Values:** (17 categories)
- **Commercial:** Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing, Commercial Activity: Other
- **Residential:** Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation
- **Public Services:** Education, Government Services, Medical or Emergency Services
- **Infrastructure:** Transport, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Construction
- **Other:** Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Attraction Sports or Activity, Religious Worship and Funeral Services, Mixed Use, Unknown

**✅ Correct Examples:**
```
Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other]
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection]
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // All residential types
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail]  // Retail focus
Building use group: does not contain [Unknown]  // Exclude unclear properties
```

**❌ Incorrect Examples:**
```
❌ Building use group: 'Mixed Use' OR 'Commercial'
❌ Building use group: NOT 'Agriculture'
❌ Building use group: contains any [C3, E]  // WRONG - those are Use class values, not Building use group
```

**Strategic Use Cases:**

1. **Broad Commercial Search:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other, Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]
   ```

2. **Exclude Non-Development Sites:**
   ```
   Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
   ```

3. **Mixed-Use Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
   // Then refine with specific Use class filters
   ```

4. **Conversion Opportunities:**
   ```
   Building use group: contains any [Temporary Or Holiday Accommodation]  // Hotels to residential
   Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Logistics Or Manufacturing]  // Industrial to residential
   ```

**Performance/Notes:**
- Fast filter - indexed field
- Good for initial broad filtering, then refine with "Use class"
- "Mixed Use" is explicitly tagged - useful for precedent-based searches
- "Unknown" category exists - may want to exclude or investigate separately
- More intuitive than "Use class" codes but less planning-specific

**Relationship to Other Filters:**
- **Broader than:** Use class (E, C3, B2, etc.)
- **Narrower than:** Property type (Detached, Commercial, etc.)
- **Different from:** Property classification (OS taxonomy)

**Common Combinations:**
```
# Broad commercial search, then refine
Building use group: contains any [Commercial Activity: Retail, Commercial Activity: Other]
Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service]

# Residential focus with mixed-use
Building use group: contains any [Residential Accommodation, Mixed Use]
Property type: contains any [Flat, Commercial]

# Exclude unsuitable for development
Building use group: does not contain [Agriculture Or Aquaculture, Utility Or Environmental Protection, Unknown]
Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt]
```
