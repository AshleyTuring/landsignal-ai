### Claude - Approach A: Precedent Replication - 8-Storey Mixed-Use (Slough Focus)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Approach has strong strategic logic for precedent-based development but contains syntax errors in SearchLand filters that would prevent proper execution. Capital and ROI are feasible within constraints, implementation is viable, and deal structure (option agreements) is sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Invalid syntax in filter 2: "Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"" - SearchLand does not support OR operators within single filter lines; this will fail to parse correctly.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: "Proposal: contains any ["retail", "commercial"]" or split into separate filters if needed.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Slough precedent focus creates geographic concentration risk but leverages proven planning success.

### Claude - Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales at Discount
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Strong motivation signal from distressed corporate sales, capital within budget, ROI achievable through volume, implementation feasible via liquidator contact, deal structure (direct purchase) legally sound. However, syntax error in ownership filter.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Invalid syntax in filter 1: "Ownership type: is equal to Company" - Should use "is one of [Company]" for list-based filters.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: "Ownership type: is one of [Company]".  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Liquidation pool is limited but provides exceptional motivation; combines well with other distressed asset strategies.

### Claude - Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition - Low-Rise to 8-Storey
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and use correct syntax, units are accurate (acres, metres), capital feasible, ROI targets achievable, implementation steps are practical, deal structure (airspace rights purchase) is financially sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Airspace strategy minimizes capital exposure while enabling high-density development.

### Claude - Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement Promotion
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters are valid and correctly formatted, units accurate, capital within limits, ROI projections realistic for patient capital, implementation timeline is long but executable, deal structure (options with promotion) is viable.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Never-sold properties represent hidden opportunity but require extensive due diligence.

### Claude - Approach E: HMO License Expiry + Low EPC Arbitrage
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist with proper syntax, units correct, capital fits budget, ROI achievable through volume strategy, implementation is straightforward, deal structure (direct purchase with compliance fixes) is sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Regulatory deadline creates strong motivation; volume approach suits smaller deal sizes.

### Codex - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** Approach relies on non-existent filter for planning decision status, making the core search strategy unexecutable. Other elements (capital, ROI, implementation) appear feasible if filters were corrected.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Filter 2: "Decision: is equal to Approved" - No "Decision" filter exists in SearchLand; cannot filter by planning approval status directly.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Replace with proxy filters like "Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0" and "Last application submitted: is before [recent date]" to target approved schemes.  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Precedent focus is strong but requires alternative filtering methods.

### Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (Cashflow Upside)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Solid conversion strategy with feasible capital/ROI, viable implementation, sound deal structure. However, syntax error in tenure filter prevents proper execution.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- Invalid syntax in filter 3: "Tenure: is equal to Freehold" - Should use "is one of [Freehold]".  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- Change to: "Tenure: is one of [Freehold]".  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- EPC-driven motivation is well-supported by available filters.

### Codex - Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit (Add Floors)
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters valid with correct syntax, units accurate, capital feasible, ROI achievable, implementation practical, deal structure (option/JV) sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Freehold focus avoids lease complications in vertical extensions.

### Gemini - Approach A: Precedent-Based Option Agreement
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist and use proper syntax, units correct, capital within budget, ROI realistic, implementation executable, deal structure (option agreement) legally sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Off-market targeting via long-hold filters is effective for motivated sellers.

### Gemini - Approach B: Strategic Airspace Development
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters valid with correct operators, units accurate, capital feasible, ROI achievable, implementation viable, deal structure (airspace purchase) sound.  
**Technical Issues (if any):**  
- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**  
- Unbroken freeholds reduce complexity in airspace acquisitions.

### Grok - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication

- None identified.  
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**  
- N/A  
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
