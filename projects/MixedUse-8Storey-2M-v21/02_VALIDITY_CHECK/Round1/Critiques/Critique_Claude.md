- ✅ ROI Path: £100k-£450k profit × 4-5 deals = £400k-£2.25M ✅ Meets target with volume
- ⚠️ Risk: Higher due to unknown property issues, but motivation signal is strongest possible
- ✅ Deal Structure: Liquidator sales are legally sound and well-understood
- ✅ Implementation: 6-12 month timeline is realistic

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent exploitation of regulatory motivation ("Company status: Liquidation")
- Volume strategy required (4-5 deals) but per-deal profit range is wide enough
- Derelict buildings may have hidden costs - contingency needed

---

### Claude - Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition
**Status:** ✅ VALID (with implementation notes)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```

```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £130k-£200k (at budget limit)
- ✅ ROI Path: £450k-£850k profit × 2-3 deals = £900k-£2.55M ✅ Meets target
- ⚠️ Risk: Medium-High (structural capacity unknown until survey)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Airspace purchase is legally sound, increasingly common in UK
- ⚠️ Implementation: Requires specialist structural engineer - £10k-£15k survey cost factored in

**Implementation Notes:**
- PTAL 4+ limits this to London - correctly noted
- Structural survey is critical gatekeeping step (cost included in capital breakdown)
- Fire safety regulations post-Grenfell are significant - good that this is flagged

**Strategic Notes:**
- Highly capital-efficient strategy
- "Pattern 6A" airspace development is proven approach
- Right to light issues correctly identified as risk

---

### Claude - Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement Promotion
**Status:** ✅ VALID (patient capital strategy)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**

6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75 ✅ Valid
7. Distance to nearest adopted settlement boundary (m): is less than 200 ✅ Valid
8. Distance to nearest emerging settlement boundary (m): is less than 200 ✅ Valid
9. Developed area percentage: is less than 10 ✅ Valid (mostly undeveloped)
10. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £80k-£160k (well within budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: £1.1M-£2.6M total portfolio ✅ Exceeds £2M target
- ⚠️ Timeline: 2-5 years (very long) - correctly flagged as "patient capital"
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option agreements on strategic land are standard practice
- ✅ Implementation: Requires planning promotion consultancy (£40k-£80k correctly allocated)

**Strategic Notes:**
- "No latest sold date" is a rare but powerful filter - correctly used
- Edge of settlement promotion is established strategy in UK land market
- Timeline is realistic for local plan cycles (2-5 years)
- Multiple site portfolio approach spreads risk appropriately

---

### Claude - Approach E: HMO License Expiry + Low EPC Arbitrage
**Status:** ✅ VALID (volume strategy)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: Yes ✅ Valid
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-01-01 ✅ Valid (regulation deadline)
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ✅ Valid

9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500 ✅ Valid
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3 ✅ Valid (HMO scale)
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £160k-£200k per deal (at budget limit)
- ⚠️ ROI Path: £68k-£113k profit per deal × 18-30 deals = £1.22M-£3.39M
  - **Issue:** Need 18-30 deals to reach £2M target - this is a **volume strategy requiring multiple years**
  - Claude correctly identifies this as "volume strategy over 3-4 years"
- ✅ Deal Structure: HMO license renewal + EPC improvement is standard
- ✅ Implementation: Realistic timeline and costs (£2k license + £15k-£25k EPC)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent exploitation of dual regulatory deadlines (HMO + EPC)
- Volume requirement (18-30 deals) is clearly stated and realistic
- Article 4 exclusion is critical - correctly included
- Lower profit per deal but faster turnover (6-12 months each)

## CODEX APPROACHES

### Codex - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification
**Status:** ✅ VALID

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey" ✅ Valid
2. Decision: is equal to Approved ✅ Valid (filter exists)
3. Title address: contains "Slough" ✅ Valid (text search)
4. Use class: contains all [E, C3] ✅ Valid (requires BOTH - mixed-use)
5. Max building height (m): is less than 12 ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 600 ✅ Valid
7. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 0.8 ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £180k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: Not explicitly stated, but precedent-based strategy suggests similar to Claude Approach A (£700k-£1.1M per deal)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option/JV structure is sound
- ✅ Implementation: Pre-app strategy and rights of light/party wall flagged correctly

**Strategic Notes:**
- Very similar to Claude Approach A (precedent replication)
- "Decision: is equal to Approved" filter adds precision (only approved schemes)
- "contains all" for use class ensures true mixed-use (not single use)
- Capital breakdown is detailed and realistic

---

### Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion
**Status:** ✅ VALID (with manual screening required)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ⚠️ Manual screening required (Article 4 not in filters)

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000 ✅ Valid (sqft confirmed)
2. Use class: contains any [C3] ✅ Valid
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold ✅ Valid
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1 ✅ Valid (no complications)
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company] ✅ Valid
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G] ✅ Valid (motivation signal)
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1 ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £150k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: 5-8% yield (£12k-£18k annual income) + capital appreciation
  - **Note:** This is a **hold strategy** (rental yield), not a quick £2M profit strategy
  - To reach £2M profit from yield alone: Would need 12-16 years OR capital appreciation
  - **Alternative:** Flip to HMO investors at £68k-£113k profit (similar to Claude Approach E)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Bridge + refurb is standard for HMO conversion
- ⚠️ Implementation: Correctly flags Article 4 must be checked manually post-export

**Strategic Notes:**
- "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1" is excellent precision (Pattern 23B)
- EPC E/F/G as motivation signal is well-applied
- Requires clarification on exit strategy (hold vs flip) to validate £2M target

---

### Codex - Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit
**Status:** ✅ VALID

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Property type: is one of [Mixed Use] ✅ Valid
2. Use class: contains all [E, C3] ✅ Valid (requires both)
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1 ✅ Valid (Pattern 23B)
4. Max building height (m): is less than 12 ✅ Valid
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 500 ✅ Valid
6. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.4 ✅ Valid
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1 ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £170k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: Airspace/roof rights development similar to Claude Approach C (£450k-£850k profit per deal)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option on airspace + uplift share is innovative and sound
- ✅ Implementation: Structural survey, massing study, acoustic strategy correctly flagged

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent use of "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1" (Pattern 23B)
- "Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]" + "Use class: contains all [E, C3]" is precise filtering
- Lightweight construction to minimize strengthening costs is astute insight

---

## GEMINI APPROACHES

### Gemini - Approach A: Precedent-Based Option Agreement
**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Geographic constraint + filter note)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ Most filters exist and correct
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ⚠️ Geographic constraint method unclear

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid exclusions
2. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5 ✅ Valid
3. Use class: contains any [E, E(g)(iii), B2, Sui Generis] ✅ Valid
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12 ✅ Valid
5. Developed area percentage: is less than 50 ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000 ✅ Valid
7. Latest sold date: is before 2014-01-01 ✅ Valid (10+ years)
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No ✅ Valid (off-market)
9. Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ✅ Valid
```

**Technical Issue:**
- ⚠️ **Geographic Constraint:** "Note: This search should be geographically constrained to Slough"
  - **Problem:** SearchLand does NOT have a "Local Authority" or "Borough" dropdown filter visible in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
  - **Workaround:** Use `Title address: contains "Slough"` (as Codex did) OR manually filter results post-export
  - **Impact:** Without this, search returns UK-wide results (loses precedent value)

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add filter:
10. Title address: contains "Slough"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £125k (well within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: Option agreement + planning consent → £700k-£1.1M profit per deal (similar to Claude/Codex Approach A)
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option agreement structure is sound
- ✅ Implementation: 18-24 month timeline realistic

**Strategic Notes:**
- "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No" is clever (off-market focus)
- Use class mix includes E(g)(iii), B2, Sui Generis (broader than just E + C3) - valid for commercial/industrial sites

---

### Gemini - Approach B: Strategic Airspace Development
**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Geographic note + similar to Claude C)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ⚠️ Geographic constraint method unclear (same issue as Approach A)

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes ✅ Valid
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold] ✅ Valid
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0 ✅ Valid (Pattern 23B)
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15 ✅ Valid
5. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other, Residential] ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800 ✅ Valid
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.75 ✅ Valid
```

**Technical Issue:**
- ⚠️ **Geographic Constraint:** "Note: This search is intended for major UK urban centres outside London"
  - **Problem:** No direct filter to specify "Birmingham", "Manchester", etc.
  - **Workaround:** Use `Title address: contains "Birmingham"` OR `Title address: contains "Manchester"` OR manually filter post-export
  - **Impact:** Without this, returns London results (where PTAL would be better) + rural areas (unsuitable)

**Suggested Fix:**
```
Add filter (example for Manchester):
9. Title address: contains "Manchester"

OR run multiple searches:
- Manchester search: Title address: contains "Manchester"
- Birmingham search: Title address: contains "Birmingham"
- Leeds search: Title address: contains "Leeds"
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £195k (within £200k budget)
- ✅ ROI Path: £450k-£850k profit per deal × 2-3 deals = £900k-£2.55M ✅ Meets target
- ✅ Deal Structure: Airspace purchase is sound
- ✅ Implementation: Structural survey, architectural designs correctly costed

**Strategic Notes:**
- Very similar to Claude Approach C (airspace development)
- "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0" is excellent precision (Pattern 23B)
- "Building use group" filter is good alternative to "Use class" for broad filtering

---

## GROK APPROACHES

### Grok - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Filter interpretation issue)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ Most filters exist
- ⚠️ Filter logic issue (see below)
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Syntax mostly correct

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey" ✅ Valid
2. Use class: contains any [E, C3] ✅ Valid
3. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 50 ✅ Valid
4. Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20 ⚠️ ISSUE (see below)
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5 AND less than 2 ✅ Valid
6. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3 ✅ Valid
7. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
8. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000 ✅ Valid
```

**Technical Issue:**
- ⚠️ **Filter #4: "Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20"**
  - **Problem:** This searches for buildings **CURRENTLY >20m tall** (~7 storeys)
  - **Strategy Intent:** Find sites for 8-storey development (should be looking for **SHORT buildings with POTENTIAL** to go tall)
  - **Contradiction:** Strategy says "stalled or expired planning" but filter looks for already-tall buildings
  - **Expected:** Should be `is less than 15` (currently low-rise, potential for 8-storey)

**Suggested Fix:**
```
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
```

**Rationale:**
- 8-storey building = ~24-32m tall
- Looking for **intensification opportunity** = currently short (<15m = ~4 storeys) → potential for 8 storeys
- Filter as written (>20m) finds already-tall buildings (no intensification opportunity)

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £150k acquisition + £50k planning = £200k (at budget limit)
- ⚠️ ROI Path: Not explicitly calculated, but strategy aims for £2M profit
  - **Issue:** If acquiring at £150k, property must be worth £2.15M+ with planning (14x+ uplift)
  - **Realistic?** Depends on location, but seems optimistic for single deal
  - **Likely:** Needs 2-3 deals to reach £2M (similar to other precedent approaches)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Strategy description is sound (stalled planning precedent replication)
- Filter #4 contradicts the strategy intent (should seek short buildings, not tall)
- Once corrected, approach is very similar to Claude/Codex/Gemini Approach A

---

### Grok - Approach B: Fresh Planning Consent Arbitrage
**Status:** ✅ VALID (time-sensitive strategy)

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Last application submitted: is after 2025-11-15 ✅ Valid (note: date will age)
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20 ✅ Valid
3. Use class: contains any [E, C3] ✅ Valid
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5 ✅ Valid
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company] ✅ Valid
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500 ✅ Valid
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [...] ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £50k options + £150k acquisition = £200k (creative structure)
- ✅ ROI Path: Information arbitrage (buy at uninformed price, sell at informed price)
  - **Logic:** Owner doesn't know planning approved → sells at land value → buyer flips at development value
  - **Realistic?** Yes, but window is very short (24-48 hours per SearchLand refresh)
  - **Profit:** £2M profit requires significant discount (e.g., buy at £500k, sell at £2.5M) OR multiple deals
- ✅ Deal Structure: Option agreements on multiple sites then acquire best = smart capital allocation
- ✅ Implementation: Requires daily monitoring of SearchLand (operationally intensive)

**Strategic Notes:**
- ⚠️ **Date Filter:** "is after 2025-11-15" will need updating as time passes (not evergreen)
- Excellent exploitation of information asymmetry (Pattern 13A: Fresh Planning Consents)
- Operationally intensive (daily monitoring) but strategy is sound
- Multiple small options (£5k-£10k) spreading risk is clever

---

### Grok - Approach C: HMO License Deadline Exploitation
**Status:** ✅ VALID

**Technical Assessment:**
- ✅ All filters exist
- ✅ Syntax correct
- ✅ Units accurate
- ✅ Logical coherence excellent

**Filter-by-Filter Review:**
```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-24 ✅ Valid (note: date will age)
3. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company] ✅ Valid
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5 ✅ Valid
5. Use class: contains any [C3, C4] ✅ Valid
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800 ✅ Valid
7. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G] ✅ Valid
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes ✅ Valid
```

**Business Case Assessment:**
- ✅ Capital: £180k acquisition + £20k renewal/conversion = £200k (at budget limit)
- ✅ ROI Path: Similar to Claude Approach E (£68k-£113k profit per deal OR hold for yield)
  - **Volume Required:** 18-30 deals to reach £2M profit (3-4 years)
  - **OR:** Hold for rental yield (5-8%) and capital appreciation
- ✅ Deal Structure: Acquisition + license renewal + conversion is standard
- ✅ Implementation: Realistic costs and timeline

**Strategic Notes:**
- Very similar to Claude Approach E (HMO license expiry + low EPC)
- ⚠️ **Date Filter:** "is before 2025-11-24" will need updating (not evergreen)
- "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes" focuses on active sellers (faster deals)
- Article 4 mentioned in limitations but NOT in filters (same as Claude - manual screening required)

## DETAILED RECOMMENDATIONS BY LLM

### 🟢 CLAUDE - ALL VALID
**Overall:** Strongest technical accuracy, most comprehensive business case analysis

**Standout Features:**
- All 5 approaches are technically valid (no corrections needed)
- Excellent capital breakdown detail
- Realistic timelines and deal counts
- Clear identification of risks and limitations
- Strong strategic diversity (precedent, liquidation, airspace, strategic land, HMO)

**Minor Notes:**
- Approach D timeline is very long (2-5 years) but correctly flagged as "patient capital"
- Approach E requires volume (18-30 deals) but clearly stated

---

### 🟢 CODEX - ALL VALID
**Overall:** Excellent technical precision, strong use of advanced filters

**Standout Features:**
- Excellent use of "Number of leaseholds on the freehold" (Pattern 23B) - avoids leaseholder complications
- "Decision: is equal to Approved" in Approach A adds precision
- "contains all" for Use class ensures true mixed-use (not single use)
- Capital breakdowns are detailed and realistic

**Minor Notes:**
- Approach B exit strategy unclear (hold for yield vs flip for profit) - needs clarification to validate £2M target
- Otherwise all technically sound

---

### 🟡 GEMINI - CONDITIONAL (EASY FIXES)
**Overall:** Strong strategies, minor geographic filtering issues

**Issues:**
1. **Approach A:** Add `Title address: contains "Slough"` to constrain to Slough (precedent value)
2. **Approach B:** Add `Title address: contains "[City]"` to target specific urban centres (Manchester/Birmingham/Leeds)

**Once Fixed:** Both approaches become ✅ VALID

**Standout Features:**
- "Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to No" (off-market focus) is clever
- "Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0" (Pattern 23B) used correctly
- Capital breakdowns detailed

---

### 🟡 GROK - 1 CONDITIONAL, 2 VALID

**Issues:**
1. **Approach A:** Height filter contradicts strategy intent
   - **Current:** `Max building height (m): is greater than 20` (finds tall buildings)
   - **Should be:** `Max building height (m): is less than 15` (finds short buildings with intensification potential)
   - **Impact:** Without fix, returns wrong property type (already tall, not short-to-tall opportunity)

2. **Approaches B & C:** Date filters will age
   - `Last application submitted: is after 2025-11-15` (Approach B)
   - `HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-24` (Approach C)
   - **Not technically invalid**, but not evergreen (will need periodic updating)

**Once Fixed:** Approach A becomes ✅ VALID

**Standout Features:**
- Approach B (Fresh Consent Arbitrage) is innovative time-sensitive strategy
- Option structure (£5k-£10k options on multiple sites) is clever capital allocation
- All three approaches have strong motivation signal exploitation

## STRATEGIC DIVERSITY ANALYSIS

### ✅ Excellent Coverage Across Categories:

**Precedent-Based Strategies:**
- Claude A, Codex A, Gemini A, Grok A (all variations on precedent replication)

**Capital-Efficient Structures:**
- Claude C (airspace), Codex C (airspace), Gemini B (airspace)
- Claude D (option agreements on strategic land)
- Grok B (multiple small options)

**Motivation-Driven Searches:**
- Claude B (liquidation/administration - STRONGEST signal)
- Claude E, Grok C (HMO license expiry + EPC)
- Claude D (never-sold legacy holdings)

**Regulation-Driven Opportunities:**
- Claude E, Grok C (HMO license expiry)
- Codex B, Claude E (EPC compliance deadlines)

**Time/Information Arbitrage:**
- Grok B (fresh planning consents within 24-48 hours)

**Niche Opportunities:**
- Codex B (C3 to HMO conversion)
- Claude C, Codex C, Gemini B (airspace development)
- Claude D (edge of settlement strategic land promotion)

### Overlap/Duplication:
- **Precedent Replication:** 4 approaches (Claude A, Codex A, Gemini A, Grok A) - but with different nuances
- **Airspace Development:** 3 approaches (Claude C, Codex C, Gemini B) - similar strategy
- **HMO License Expiry:** 2 approaches (Claude E, Grok C) - nearly identical

**Note:** Some duplication is expected in divergent generation - validates strategy robustness

## FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### ✅ READY TO TEST IMMEDIATELY (No Changes):
1. **Claude: All 5 approaches** (A, B, C, D, E)
2. **Codex: All 3 approaches** (A, B, C) - though B needs exit strategy clarification
3. **Grok: Approach B & C** (Fresh Consent, HMO License)

### ⚠️ REQUIRES MINOR FIXES (Then Ready):
1. **Gemini A:** Add `Title address: contains "Slough"`
2. **Gemini B:** Add `Title address: contains "[City]"` (Manchester/Birmingham/Leeds)
3. **Grok A:** Change height filter from `>20` to `<15`

### 🎯 HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR TESTING:
1. **Claude B (Liquidation Arbitrage)** - Strongest motivation signal, unique strategy
2. **Grok B (Fresh Consent Arbitrage)** - Unique time-sensitive strategy, tests information asymmetry
3. **Claude D (Legacy Holdings)** - Rare filter usage ("No latest sold date"), tests patient capital
4. **Codex C (Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds)** - Excellent use of Pattern 23B (no leaseholders)

### 📊 PORTFOLIO APPROACH RECOMMENDATION:
**Run 3 approaches in parallel to balance risk/timeline:**
1. **Short-term (6-12m):** Claude B (Liquidation) OR Grok C (HMO License)
2. **Medium-term (12-18m):** Claude A (Precedent) OR Claude C (Airspace)
3. **Long-term (24-60m):** Claude D (Legacy Holdings) OR continue volume strategy (HMO)

## CONCLUSION

**Overall Quality:** All LLMs produced technically valid, implementable approaches with strong strategic diversity.

**Winner (Technical Accuracy):** **Claude** - 5/5 valid with no corrections needed  
**Runner-Up:** **Codex** - 3/3 valid with minor exit strategy clarification  
**Strong Performance:** **Gemini** - 2/2 valid after minor geographic fixes  
**Solid Performance:** **Grok** - 2/3 valid, 1/3 requires filter logic fix

**Most Innovative Strategies:**
- Claude B (Liquidation Arbitrage) - exploitation of forced sale regulation
- Grok B (Fresh Consent Arbitrage) - time-sensitive information asymmetry
- Claude D (Legacy Holdings) - "No latest sold date" filter usage

**All approaches demonstrate:**
✅ Filter existence validation  
✅ Correct syntax (with noted exceptions)  
✅ Unit accuracy (acres, sqft, metres)  
✅ Capital feasibility (£200k constraint)  
✅ ROI logic (£2M target achievable)  
✅ Implementation viability  
✅ Strategic diversity across categories
