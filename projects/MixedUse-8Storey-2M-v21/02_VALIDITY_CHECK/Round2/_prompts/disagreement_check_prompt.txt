# Disagreement Detection Task

Analyze the 4 critique files and identify TECHNICAL AND BUSINESS CASE DISAGREEMENTS.

## What Counts as Disagreement
- LLM A says filter exists, LLM B says it doesn't (factual dispute)
- LLM A says "acres", LLM B says "sqft" for same filter (unit dispute)
- LLM A says VALID syntax, LLM B says INVALID syntax (technical dispute)
- LLM A says £n is sufficient, LLM B says it's not (capital feasibility dispute)
- LLM A says ROI achievable, LLM B says unrealistic (business case dispute)
- LLM A says deal structure works, LLM B says legally/financially flawed (implementation dispute)

## What Does NOT Count
- Priority rankings (A ranks #1, B ranks #3 - both valid)
- Strategic preferences (speed vs certainty - philosophical)
- Implementation styles (different but both correct)

## Special Note on Precedent-Based Approaches
For approaches replicating user-provided planning applications:
- Business case is AUTO-VALID (user requested it)
- Focus validation on: Do filters actually replicate the precedent correctly?
- Multiple valid filter implementations are expected and acceptable

## Output Format
If disagreements exist:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: YES

### Disagreement #1
**Type:** [Filter existence | Units | Syntax | Capital feasibility | ROI | Deal structure]
**Approaches:** [Which approaches affected]
**Positions:**
- LLM A: [Position]
- LLM B: [Position]
- LLM C: [Position]
- LLM D: [Position]

**Impact:** [Critical | Minor]
**Requires iteration:** [YES | NO]

---

If no disagreements:

DISAGREEMENTS_FOUND: NO

All LLMs agree on technical and business case facts. Strategic differences are preserved.


## CRITIQUES TO ANALYZE

### Critique_Claude

Based on the comprehensive reference materials provided (AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md, LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md, and all four LLM iteration assessments), I'll now conduct a detailed technical and business case validation of all approaches.

---

# **COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL & BUSINESS CASE VALIDATION**
**Date:** 2025-01-19  
**Validator:** Expert Property Development Analyst  
**Scope:** All approaches from Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Grok (Round 1 iterations included)

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

After thorough cross-validation of all approaches against authoritative filter documentation and the four LLM iteration assessments, I identify:

- **✅ VALID (Ready to Test):** 5 approaches
- **⚠️ CONDITIONAL (Minor Fixes Required):** 8 approaches  
- **❌ INVALID (Major Rework Required):** 2 approaches

**Key Findings:**
1. **Most common error:** Filter syntax violations (OR operators, wrong filter names)
2. **Critical missing filter:** "Decision: Approved" does not exist (affects Codex A)
3. **Documentation gaps:** Some filters used in presets not in AvailableFilters (e.g., "No latest sold date")
4. **Unit consistency:** All LLMs correctly used acres/metres/sqft
5. **Strategic diversity achieved:** Approaches span precedent-based, capital-efficient, motivation-driven, and regulation-driven strategies

---

## **CLAUDE APPROACHES**

### **Claude - Approach A: Precedent Replication (Slough Focus)**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Issues:**

1. **Filter 2: `Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"`**
   - **Issue:** OR operator not supported in single filter line
   - **Evidence:** LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md explicitly states: "SearchLand AI does NOT support OR within a single filter line"
   - **Impact:** Filter will fail or match literal string ' "retail" OR "commercial" '
   - **Severity:** HIGH - core filter broken

2. **All other filters (1, 3-10):** ✅ Valid syntax and values

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
# Option 1: Use list syntax (if Proposal supports it)
✅ Proposal: contains any ["retail", "commercial"]

# Option 2: Split into separate searches
Search A: Proposal: contains "retail"
Search B: Proposal: contains "commercial"
(Merge results)

# Option 3: Broaden search
✅ Proposal: contains "mixed-use"  (captures both retail + commercial)
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- Precedent-based approach = auto-valid per task instructions
- £60k-£120k capital fits within £200k budget
- Option agreement strategy sound
- ROI calculations reasonable (£700k-£1.1M profit per deal)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Strongest approach for planning risk mitigation (direct precedent)
- Good capital efficiency via options
- Slough-specific = limited volume but high quality

**Updated Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Fix Filter 2 OR syntax, then VALID

---

### **Claude - Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage**

**Status:** ✅ **VALID** (with minor note)

**Technical Review:**

All filters verified:
1. ✅ Ownership type: is equal to Company - Valid (LEARNINGS shows `is equal to` works for list filters)
2. ✅ Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration] - Valid filter exists
3. ✅ Title area (acres) - Correct units
4. ✅ Use class: contains any [...] - Correct syntax
5. ✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - Valid
6. ✅ Planning constraints: does not contain [...] - Valid
7. ✅ Building on title is derelict: Yes - Valid
8. ✅ Percentage of plot un-constrained - Valid

**Minor Note:**
- Filter 1 uses `is equal to Company` - documentation prefers `is one of [Company]` but both work
- See Iteration_Claude and Iteration_Gemini confirmations

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £130k-£200k capital reasonable for distressed acquisitions
- 20-40% discount typical in liquidation scenarios (validated)
- ROI calculations sound (£100k-£450k profit per deal)
- Motivation signal extremely strong (forced sale)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Highest motivation signal of all approaches (legally obligated to sell)
- Limited volume expected (liquidations rare)
- Fast execution timeline (6-12 months)

**Updated Status:** ✅ **VALID** - No changes required

---

### **Claude - Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition**

**Status:** ✅ **VALID**

**Technical Review:**

All filters verified:
1. ✅ A building in the title has flat roof: Yes - **Confirmed exists** (AvailableFilters line 203)
2. ✅ Max building height on title (m): is less than 12 - Valid
3. ✅ Use class: contains any [...] - Correct syntax
4. ✅ PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b] - Valid (London-specific)
5. ✅ Title area (acres) - Correct units
6. ✅ Number of buildings on title: is equal to 1 - Valid
7. ✅ Tenure: is one of [Freehold] - Valid
8. ✅ Planning constraints: does not contain [...] - Valid
9. ✅ Percentage of plot un-constrained - Valid
10. ✅ Distance to nearest Train Station (m) - Valid

**Note on Disagreement:**
- Codex initially questioned flat roof filter existence
- **Resolved:** AvailableFilters explicitly lists "A building in the title has flat roof ✓" (confirmed by multiple LLMs)

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £130k-£200k capital reasonable for airspace rights
- Structural risk acknowledged and budgeted
- ROI calculations sound (£450k-£850k profit per deal)
- Strategy well-documented in LEARNINGS (Pattern 6A)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Capital-efficient (airspace 20-40% of freehold value)
- High PTAL = strong planning support
- Requires structural expertise (acknowledged)

**Updated Status:** ✅ **VALID** - No changes required

---

### **Claude - Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Issues:**

1. **Filter 1: `No latest sold date: Yes`**
   - **Issue:** Filter not in AvailableFilters (documentation gap)
   - **Evidence:** Used in SearchLand Presets #18, #69 (LEARNINGS_DATABASE) but NOT in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md
   - **Status:** Uncertain - may exist despite missing documentation
   - **Severity:** MEDIUM - needs empirical test
   
2. **Filter 4: `Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes`**
   - **Issue:** Wrong filter name AND wrong operator type
   - **Correct filter:** `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`
   - **Evidence:** AvailableFilters lists "Applications in the last 5 years" (numeric filter)
   - **Severity:** HIGH - filter broken

3. **Filters 2, 3, 5-10:** ✅ Valid

**Suggested Fixes:**

```
# Filter 1 Options:
✅ No latest sold date: Yes  (test as-is - may work despite missing from docs)
OR
✅ Latest sold date: is before 1900-01-01  (workaround proxy)

# Filter 4 Fix:
❌ Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes
✅ Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £80k-£160k capital appropriate for option strategy
- Long timeline (2-5 years) acknowledged
- ROI calculations exceptional (£1.1M-£2.6M total)
- Strategy sound (legacy holdings + promotion)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Patient capital required (2-5 year horizon)
- Exceptional returns if successful (£1M+ profit potential)
- Risk: No guarantee of allocation

**Updated Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Fix Filter 4 syntax; empirically test Filter 1

---

### **Claude - Approach E: HMO License Expiry + Low EPC**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Issues:**

1. **Filter 9: `Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]`**
   - **Issue:** "Article 4 Directions" is NOT a value within Planning constraints
   - **Evidence:** AvailableFilters lists 34 Planning constraints values; "Article 4" is a SEPARATE standalone filter
   - **Correct filter:** `Article 4: No` (or appropriate operator for boolean filter)
   - **Severity:** HIGH - wrong filter structure

2. **Filters 1-8, 10:** ✅ Valid

**Suggested Fix:**

```
❌ Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]
✅ Article 4: No
OR
✅ Percentage of title subject to Article 4 Directions: is equal to 0
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £160k-£200k capital appropriate
- Regulation-driven motivation strong
- Volume strategy acknowledged (18-30 deals needed)
- ROI calculations sound (£68k-£113k per deal)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Strong motivation signal (expired license = illegal to operate)
- Volume approach required (lower profit per deal)
- Fast execution (6-12 months)

**Updated Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Fix Filter 9 (Article 4 structure)

---

## **CODEX APPROACHES**

### **Codex - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification**

**Status:** ❌ **INVALID**

**Critical Technical Issue:**

1. **Filter 2: `Decision: is equal to Approved`**
   - **Issue:** Filter DOES NOT EXIST in SearchLand
   - **Evidence:** 
     - Exhaustive search of AvailableFilters confirms no "Decision" or "Planning Status" filter
     - AvailableFilters explicitly notes: "⚠️ CRITICAL MISSING: No 'Planning Status' filter"
     - Confirmed by Iteration_Claude, Iteration_Gemini, Iteration_Grok
   - **Impact:** **UNEXECUTABLE** - entire approach depends on filtering by approval status
   - **Severity:** CRITICAL - approach fundamentally broken

2. **Filters 1, 3-7:** ✅ Valid (if Filter 2 could be resolved)

**Workaround Options:**

```
# Cannot filter directly by "Approved" status
# Workarounds:
✅ Proposal: contains "approved" OR "consent"  (text search - unreliable)
✅ Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 0  (indicates application exists)
✅ Last application submitted: is before [date]  (old application, likely decided)

# Then manually screen exported results for approval status via planning portal
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID** (conceptually)
- Precedent-based = auto-valid
- Capital structure sound
- Strategy logical

**Strategic Notes:**
- Approach is conceptually strong (precedent replication)
- BUT technically unexecutable without major workaround
- Requires manual screening of planning portal data

**Updated Status:** ❌ **INVALID** - Requires major rework (Filter 2 does not exist)

---

### **Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion**

**Status:** ✅ **VALID** (with minor note)

**Technical Review:**

All filters verified:
1. ✅ Property floor area (sqft) - Correct units
2. ✅ Use class: contains any [C3] - Valid
3. ✅ Tenure: is equal to Freehold - Valid (LEARNINGS shows `is equal to` works)
4. ✅ Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1 - Valid
5. ✅ Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company] - Valid
6. ✅ EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G] - Valid
7. ✅ Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1 - Valid

**Minor Note:**
- Filter 3 uses `is equal to Freehold` - documentation prefers `is one of [Freehold]` but both work
- See Iteration_Gemini confirmation

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £150k capital reasonable for acquisition + refurb
- HMO conversion strategy sound
- ROI calculations reasonable (5-8% yield)
- Motivation signals strong (EPC pressure, unbroken freehold)

**Strategic Notes:**
- Clear strategy (C3 to HMO conversion)
- Good motivation signals (low EPC, no leaseholder friction)
- Must manually check Article 4 areas

**Updated Status:** ✅ **VALID** - No changes required

---

### **Codex - Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit**

**Status:** ❌ **INVALID** (but easily fixable)

**Technical Issue:**

1. **Filter 1: `Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]`**
   - **Issue:** "Mixed Use" is NOT a value in "Property type" filter
   - **Evidence:** AvailableFilters lists only 5 Property type values: Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial
   - **"Mixed Use" exists in:** "Building use group" filter (separate filter)
   - **Severity:** HIGH - wrong filter/value pair

2. **Filters 2-7:** ✅ Valid

**Suggested Fix:**

```
❌ Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]
✅ Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £170k capital appropriate for option + planning
- Strategy sound (unbroken freeholds, transit-oriented)
- ROI calculations reasonable

**Strategic Notes:**
- Good strategy (single negotiation, no leaseholders)
- Transit proximity supports density
- Easy fix (change to Building use group)

**Updated Status:** ❌ **INVALID** - But easily fixable (change Filter 1 to Building use group)

---

## **GEMINI APPROACHES**

### **Gemini - Approach A: Precedent-Based Option Agreement**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Review:**

All filters verified as valid syntax:
1-9: ✅ All filters use correct syntax and exist

**Missing Geographic Filter:**
- **Issue:** Prompt says "should be geographically constrained to Slough" but no geographic filter included
- **Impact:** Will return results UK-wide, not just Slough
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - defeats precedent strategy

**Suggested Fix:**

```
# Add to prompt:
10. Title address: contains "Slough"
OR
10. Local Planning Authority: is equal to Slough Borough Council
(if LPA filter exists - not documented but likely)
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- Precedent-based = auto-valid
- £125k capital appropriate
- Option strategy sound

**Strategic Notes:**
- Well-structured approach
- Easy fix (add geographic filter)
- Otherwise technically sound

**Updated Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Add Slough geographic filter

---

### **Gemini - Approach B: Strategic Airspace Development**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Review:**

All filters verified as valid:
1-8: ✅ All filters use correct syntax and exist

**Missing Geographic Filter:**
- **Issue:** Prompt says "intended for major UK urban centres outside London" but no geographic filter
- **Impact:** Will return results including London (where strategy may not be optimal)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM - defeats targeting strategy

**Suggested Fix:**

```
# Add to prompt:
9. Title address: does not contain "London"
AND manually specify target cities:
OR
9. Title address: contains any ["Manchester", "Birmingham", "Bristol", "Leeds"]
(if list syntax supported for Title address)
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £195k capital appropriate
- Airspace strategy sound
- ROI calculations reasonable

**Strategic Notes:**
- Excellent attention to unbroken freeholds (Pattern 23B)
- Easy fix (add geographic filters)
- Otherwise technically sound

**Updated Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Add city geographic filters

---

## **GROK APPROACHES**

### **Grok - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL**

**Technical Issues:**

1. **Filter 4: `Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20`**
   - **Issue:** Searching for >20m (6-7+ storeys) when strategy targets 8-storey (24-30m)
   - **Logic concern:** Filter excludes properties >20m but strategy wants 8-storey (~25-30m)
   - **Likely intent:** Should be "is less than 20" (find low-rise to intensify)
   - **Severity:** MEDIUM - logical inconsistency

2. **Filters 1-3, 5-8:** ✅ Valid

**Capital Structure Concern:**
- Implementation says "option agreements (£10k-£20k)" but capital breakdown shows "£150k acquisition"
- These are contradictory strategies (option vs acquisition)
- **Resolution:** Precedent-based = auto-valid per task instructions (business case not assessed)

**Suggested Fix:**

```
❌ Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20
✅ Max building height on title (m): is less than 20
(Or: is less than 15 for clearer 3-4 storey targeting)
```

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID** (auto-valid per precedent rule)

**Updated Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** - Fix Filter 4 height logic; clarify capital structure

---

**Business Case:** ✅ **VALID**
- £200k capital appropriate for multiple options + one acquisition
- Information arbitrage strategy sound
- Time-sensitive execution acknowledged
- ROI calculations reasonable

**Strategic Notes:**

- Regulation-driven motivation very strong
- ROI calculations sound
- Volume + yield strategy acknowledged

**Strategic Notes:**
- Strong motivation signals (expired license + low EPC)
- Clear execution path
- Fast timeline (6-12 months)

**Updated Status:** ✅ **VALID** - No changes required

### Critique_Codex

**Approach A (Claude) - Status: CONDITIONAL**  
Reasoning: Filters look syntactically coherent and budget (£60k–£120k) fits the £200k cap, but I can’t verify filter availability because `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` isn’t present. ROI (£700k–£1.1M per planning uplift) is aggressive and assumes strong precedent transfer.  
Technical Issues:  
- Range filters rely on single-line AND (title area, proposal keywords); these can be flaky in long prompts.  
- “Building on title is inactive” and “Max building height on title (m)” need confirmation against actual filter list.  
Suggested Fixes:  
- Split the range lines into two filters each for reliability.  
- Cross-check the two filters above against the live filter list before running.  
Strategic Notes:  
- Planning-only exit is viable but sensitive to local precedent; add a fallback value-add path if precedent doesn’t translate.

**Approach B (Claude) - Status: CONDITIONAL**  
Reasoning: Capital stack (£130k–£200k) fits; syntax is clean. Profit (£100k–£450k) plausible if liquidation discounts hold. Supply risk (few liquidation cases) could limit hitting target volume.  
Technical Issues:  
- Need to confirm availability of “Company status: Liquidation/In Administration” and “Building on title is derelict” without the missing filter list.  
Suggested Fixes:  
- Validate those two filters in SearchLand; if absent, replace with Companies House status + manual derelict tag proxy (e.g., “Building on title is inactive/void”).  
Strategic Notes:  
- Add a fast flip fallback (sell as-is at modest margin) to protect downside if planning uplift is slow.

**Approach C (Claude) - Status: CONDITIONAL**  
Reasoning: Budget fits; airspace strategy feasible. PTAL + transport focus matches density goals. Profit (£450k–£850k) depends on strong buyer appetite for consented airspace.  
Technical Issues:  
- PTAL only works in London; ensure geography is constrained.  
- “Flat roof” and “Max building height on title (m)” need confirmation; risk of non-existent filters.  
Suggested Fixes:  
- Geo-limit to London when using PTAL; outside London, swap PTAL for “Distance to Train/Bus/Rapid Transit”.  
- Verify flat-roof/height filters; if missing, use roof-type tags or manual desktop checks.  
Strategic Notes:  
- Add structural capacity pre-check (engineer desktop review) before paying for surveys to de-risk spend.

**Approach D (Claude) - Status: CONDITIONAL**  
Reasoning: Option-led promotion fits budget (£80k–£160k) but very long timeline (2–5 years). ROI plausible if allocation achieved.  
Technical Issues:  
- Filters like “Distance to adopted/emerging settlement boundary” and “Developed area percentage” may not exist; EPC on large titles may be sparse.  
Suggested Fixes:  
- Verify boundary/density filters; if absent, use planning layer overlays (built-up area, housing zones) plus manual GIS checks.  
- If EPC coverage is thin, use “No latest sold date” + low application count + land use to proxy legacy holdings.  
Strategic Notes:  
- Expect low hit rate; run a larger initial pool and stage-gate spend post-call-for-sites submissions.

**Approach E (Claude) - Status: INVALID**  
Reasoning: Core filters (“Currently has HMO”, “HMO License Expiry Date”, “Article 4 Directions”) are unlikely to exist in the standard filter set; without them the search isn’t actionable. Volume requirement (18–30 deals) also strains supply.  
Technical Issues:  
- HMO licensing datasets and expiry dates not confirmed available; Article 4 may be a constraint layer, not a direct filter.  
Suggested Fixes:  
- If platform supports HMO data: confirm exact field names; otherwise pivot to proxies (Use class C4, Council tax banding anomalies, historic planning for HMOs) and manually check Article 4 maps.  
Strategic Notes:  
- Consider shrinking volume target or pairing with another approach to reach £2M.

**Global Note:** `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` was not found, so filter existence checks are inferred from prior patterns; please validate key filters in the UI before running. Next steps: 1) open the live filter list to confirm the flagged filters; 2) split range filters into separate lines for reliability; 3) align geography (PTAL) and data coverage (HMO/licensing) before execution.

### Critique_Gemini

Loaded cached credentials.
Here is the technical and business case validation for each approach, based on the provided reference materials.

### Claude - Approach A: Precedent Replication - 8-Storey Mixed-Use (Slough Focus)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The `Proposal` filter uses an `OR` operator within a single text search line. According to `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`, this syntax is not supported and will cause the filter to fail or produce incorrect results. The rest of the approach is logically sound and financially feasible.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 2 (`Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"`) uses invalid syntax.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Split the `Proposal` filter into two separate searches (one for "retail", one for "commercial") and merge the results.

---

### Claude - Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales at Discount
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and use correct syntax and units. The use of `Ownership type: is equal to Company` is confirmed as valid for a single-item list selection in `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`. The business case, centered on motivated sellers, is sound and the capital requirements are within budget.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---

### Claude - Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition - Low-Rise to 8-Storey
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters, including the key `A building in the title has flat roof: Yes`, are confirmed to exist in `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` and use correct syntax. The business case for airspace development is viable and capital-efficient.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---

### Claude - Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement Promotion
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The prompt contains two problematic filters. Filter 4 (`Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes`) uses an incorrect filter name and a boolean operator for what should be a numeric comparison. Filter 1 (`No latest sold date: Yes`) refers to a filter that is not officially documented in `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`, making its behavior unconfirmed.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 4: Invalid filter name and operator type.
- Filter 1: The filter is not documented in the primary filter list, creating uncertainty.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct Filter 4 to `Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1`.
- For Filter 1, either test the filter empirically as written or replace it with a reliable proxy like `Latest sold date: is before 1990-01-01` to capture properties that have not been sold in decades.

---

### Claude - Approach E: HMO License Expiry + Low EPC Arbitrage
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The approach incorrectly attempts to exclude Article 4 areas by listing "Article 4 Directions" within the `Planning constraints` filter. The documentation confirms that `Article 4` is a separate, dedicated filter, not a value within the constraints list.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- Filter 9 (`Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]`) is an invalid filter specification.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace the incorrect constraint with the correct standalone filter: `Article 4: No`.

---

### Codex - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Intensification
**Status:** INVALID
**Reasoning:** The approach is critically dependent on `Filter 2: Decision: is equal to Approved`. This filter does not exist in SearchLand, a fact explicitly noted in the "CRITICAL MISSING" section of `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md`. As a result, the prompt is unexecutable as written.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The filter `Decision: is equal to Approved` is non-existent.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- This approach requires a major rework. The non-existent `Decision` filter must be removed and replaced with a proxy workaround, such as searching for keywords like "approved" or "consent" in the `Proposal` text field, which would then require manual verification of results.

---

### Codex - Approach B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion (Cashflow Upside)
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and use correct syntax. The `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md` confirms `Tenure: is equal to Freehold` is a valid syntax for a single-item list selection. The business case is sound and meets capital requirements.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.

---

### Codex - Approach C: Unbroken Mixed-Use Freeholds Near Transit (Add Floors)
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The prompt uses an incorrect value for the `Property type` filter. The value `Mixed Use` is not available for the `Property type` filter; it belongs to the separate `Building use group` filter.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]` is an invalid filter/value combination.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace the incorrect filter with `Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]`.

---

### Gemini - Approach A: Precedent-Based Option Agreement
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The filter syntax is correct and the business logic is sound. However, the rationale states the search must be constrained to **Slough** to match the precedent, but this critical geographic filter is missing from the copy-paste-ready prompt, making it incomplete.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The prompt is incomplete as it lacks the required geographic filter mentioned in its own rationale.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add a geographic filter to constrain the search to the "Slough" local authority.

---

### Gemini - Approach B: Strategic Airspace Development
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The filter syntax is correct. However, the rationale specifies the search is for "major UK urban centres outside London", but this essential geographic targeting is not included in the prompt, making it logically incomplete for its stated purpose.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The prompt is incomplete as it lacks the required geographic filters.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add geographic filters to target the intended major UK cities (e.g., Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol).

---

### Grok - Approach A: Slough Mixed-Use Precedent Replication
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The approach presents a significant internal contradiction. The "Capital Required" section budgets for a `£150,000 (acquisition)`, while the "Implementation Strategy" describes using low-cost `option agreements (£10k-£20k)`. These are mutually exclusive capital strategies, making the business case logically incoherent as written.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- The implementation plan is not aligned with the capital breakdown, affecting the business case validity.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- The author must align the capital plan and implementation strategy by choosing either an acquisition-based or an option-based approach and making the text consistent.

---

### Grok - Approach B: Fresh Planning Consent Arbitrage
**Status:** VALID
**Reasoning:** The filters are syntactically correct and the information arbitrage strategy, while operationally demanding, is viable. The key filter `Last application submitted: is after [date]` works as intended to find recent applications.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None.
**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- To be effective, the date in the `Last application submitted` filter must be updated daily to find consents within the desired 24-48 hour window.

---

### Grok - Approach C: HMO License Deadline Exploitation
**Status:** CONDITIONAL
**Reasoning:** The `EPC rating` filter is missing the required square brackets `[]` around its list of values. The documented syntax for list-based filters using `is one of` requires brackets to enclose the list of values.
**Technical Issues (if any):**
- `EPC rating: is one of E, F, G` is invalid syntax due to missing brackets.
**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Correct the filter to `EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]`.

### Critique_Grok

### Claude - Approach A: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** All filters exist and syntax is correct per AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md. Units (acres, metres) are accurate. Capital (£60k-£120k) fits budget. ROI (£700k-£1.1M per deal) is achievable via planning premium. Implementation viable with option agreements and planning process.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Precedent-based strategy leverages local authority consistency.

### Claude - Approach B: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist and operators are correct (e.g., "is equal to Company" valid per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md). Units (acres, metres) correct. Capital (£130k-£200k) within budget. ROI (£100k-£450k per deal) realistic for distressed sales. Implementation viable via liquidator negotiation.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Liquidation targets strong seller motivation from legal obligations.

### Claude - Approach C: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** "A building in the title has flat roof" exists per AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md. Other filters valid with correct units (acres, metres). Capital (£130k-£200k) feasible. ROI (£450k-£850k per deal) achievable through airspace value. Implementation viable with structural surveys and planning.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Airspace strategy minimizes land acquisition costs.

### Claude - Approach D: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital (£80k-£160k) and ROI (£1.1M-£2.6M total) feasible. Implementation viable via promotion. However, filters have issues requiring fixes for execution.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "No latest sold date: Yes" not documented in AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md (exists in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md presets but needs empirical test).
- "Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes" uses invalid boolean syntax; correct is "Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1" (numeric filter).

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Replace "No latest sold date: Yes" with "Latest sold date: is before 1900-01-01" as proxy.
- Change to "Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 1".

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Legacy holdings strategy targets passive owners.

### Claude - Approach E: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital (£160k-£200k) and ROI (£68k-£113k per deal) feasible. Implementation viable via license renewal. However, Article 4 filter issue needs correction.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]" invalid; "Article 4 Directions" not in Planning constraints values per AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md. "Article 4" is a separate filter.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change to "Article 4: No" (standalone filter).

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- HMO expiry creates regulatory pressure for sales.

### Codex - Approach A: INVALID
**Status:** INVALID  
**Reasoning:** "Decision: is equal to Approved" does not exist per AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md (no planning status filter). Capital and ROI conceptually valid, but unexecutable without this filter.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Decision" filter non-existent; no direct way to filter by approval status.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A (major rework needed: remove filter, use "Proposal: contains 'approved'" as proxy and manual screening).

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Precedent focus is strong but requires workaround for planning status.

### Codex - Approach B: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist with correct operators ("is equal to Freehold" valid per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md). Units (sqft) accurate. Capital (£150k) within budget. ROI via HMO yield realistic. Implementation viable with refurb.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- HMO conversion leverages EPC motivation.

### Codex - Approach C: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital (£170k) and ROI feasible. Implementation viable. However, filter value issue needs correction.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Property type: is one of [Mixed Use]" invalid; "Mixed Use" not in Property type values (Detached, Semi-Detached, Terraced, Flat, Commercial) per AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change to "Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use]".

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Transit proximity supports density additions.

### Gemini - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital (£125k) and ROI feasible. Implementation viable with options. However, lacks geographic constraint for Slough precedent.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- No Slough-specific filter (e.g., "Title address: contains 'Slough'"); precedent requires local focus per strategy.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add "Title address: contains 'Slough'" to constrain to precedent area.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Option structure conserves capital effectively.

### Gemini - Approach B: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital (£195k) and ROI feasible. Implementation viable with airspace purchase. However, lacks geographic constraint for urban areas.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- No city-specific filter (e.g., "Title address: contains 'Manchester'"); strategy specifies major UK urban centres outside London.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Add geographic filter like "Title address: contains 'Manchester'" or similar.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Airspace targets structural arbitrage.

### Grok - Approach A: CONDITIONAL
**Status:** CONDITIONAL  
**Reasoning:** Capital (£150k-£200k) and ROI feasible. Implementation viable. However, height filter and capital structure issues.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- "Max building height on title (m): is greater than 20" may auto-convert to floors per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md; use "Max number of building floors on title" for reliability.
- Capital contradicts implementation (option vs. acquisition); clarify structure.

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- Change height filter to "Max number of building floors on title: is greater than 6" (assuming ~3m/floor).
- Specify either option-based (£60k-£70k) or acquisition-based (£200k) capital.

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Precedent replication is auto-valid per task instructions.

### Grok - Approach B: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist with correct syntax. Units (acres, metres) accurate. Capital (£50k-£150k) within budget. ROI via arbitrage realistic. Implementation viable with options and monitoring.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- Time-sensitive arbitrage exploits information asymmetry.

### Grok - Approach C: VALID
**Status:** VALID  
**Reasoning:** Filters exist with correct operators ("is one of [E, F, G]" valid for EPC per LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md). Units (acres, metres) correct. Capital (£180k-£200k) feasible. ROI (£68k-£113k per deal) achievable. Implementation viable with license renewal.

**Technical Issues (if any):**
- None

**Suggested Fixes (if CONDITIONAL):**
- N/A

**Strategic Notes (optional):**
- License expiry creates forced seller motivation.
