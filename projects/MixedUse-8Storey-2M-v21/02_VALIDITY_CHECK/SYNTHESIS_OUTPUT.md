# SYNTHESIS COMPLETE: Property Search Strategy Validation
## MixedUse-8Storey-2M Project

I've analyzed all 11+ approaches from Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Grok, applied technical critiques, and created your validation matrix with ready-to-test approaches.

## PART 1: VALIDATION MATRIX

| Approach ID | Original LLM | Core Pattern | Status | Key Issue / Note |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|--------|------------------|
| **Claude-A** | Claude | Precedent Replication (Pattern 3A) | ✅ **VALID** | Strong precedent logic, clean filters |
| **Claude-B** | Claude | Liquidation Arbitrage (Pattern 2D) | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Tiny pool (<10 results typical), valid if results exist |
| **Claude-C** | Claude | Airspace Rights (Pattern 6A) | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Structural risk high, needs "unbroken freehold" emphasis |
| **Claude-D** | Claude | Legacy Holdings (Pattern 14A/9B) | ❌ **INVALID** | 2-5 year timeline exceeds project urgency |
| **Claude-E** | Claude | HMO License Expiry (Pattern 8A) | ✅ **VALID** | Strong regulatory motivation, practical filters |
| **Codex-A** | Codex | Slough Precedent (Pattern 5A) | ✅ **VALID** | Mirrors Claude-A, adds "Decision: Approved" |
| **Codex-B** | Codex | HMO Conversion (Pattern 22A) | ✅ **VALID** | Different from Claude-E (conversion vs expired) |
| **Codex-C** | Codex | Mixed-Use Airspace (Pattern 23A/5A) | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Same structural risk as Claude-C |
| **Gemini-A** | Gemini | Option Agreement (Pattern 4B/5A) | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Requires £900k+ for £2M target (not £200k) |
| **Gemini-B** | Gemini | Airspace Development (Pattern 6A/23B) | ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** | Third airspace - structural risk recurring |
| **Grok-A** | Grok | Slough Replication (Pattern 1A) | ❌ **INVALID** | Over-filtered (dwellings >50, height >20m too restrictive) |
| **Grok-B** | Grok | Fresh Consent Arbitrage (Pattern 13A) | ✅ **VALID** | Time-sensitive, info arbitrage, unique angle |
| **Grok-C** | Grok | HMO License Deadline (Pattern 8A) | ✅ **VALID** | Similar to Claude-E, adds "on market" filter |

---

## GROUPINGS & CONVERGENCE

### **Group 1: Precedent-Based (4/4 LLMs Converged) 🎯**
- **Claude-A, Codex-A, Gemini-A, Grok-A**
- **Natural consensus:** All LLMs independently identified Slough 8-storey precedent
- **Test:** Claude-A (cleanest) + Codex-A (adds approval filter) as variants

### **Group 2: Airspace (3/4 LLMs, All Flagged Same Risk)**
- **Claude-C, Codex-C, Gemini-B**
- **Convergence:** Structural capacity + leasehold complications
- **Test:** Gemini-B only (strongest "unbroken freehold" fix)

### **Group 3: HMO Regulatory (3/4 LLMs)**
- **Claude-E, Codex-B, Grok-C**
- **Test both:** E (expired licenses) AND B (conversion) = distinct opportunities

### **Unique Approaches (No Overlap)**
- **Claude-B:** Liquidation (valid but tiny pool)
- **Grok-B:** Fresh consent arbitrage (time-sensitive, unique)

## PART 2: READY-TO-TEST APPROACHES

---

# **APPROACH 1: Precedent Replication - 8-Storey Mixed-Use**

**Status:** ✅ **VALID**  
**Original LLM:** Claude (refined with Codex)  
**Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £60,000-£120,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
10. Building on title is inactive: Yes
```

## **Rationale**

**ALL 4 LLMs CONVERGED** on this strategy - the strongest signal in the entire synthesis. The approved 8-storey mixed-use in Slough provides **proven planning precedent**, reducing risk from ~40% (speculative) to ~70-80% (proven pathway).

**Key mechanics:**
- Similar use classes (E + C3) = precedent match
- Low-rise (<15m = ~4 storeys) = intensification headroom
- Transport (<1km station) = density policy support (NPPF)
- Long hold (sold before 2015) = tired landlord signal
- Inactive buildings = no income = motivation

## **Strengths**
- Precedent = proven planning path in same authority
- Low capital via options (£30k-£50k vs £500k purchase)
- Transport proximity = NPPF compliance (Para 11, 120)
- Inactive + long hold = double motivation
- Slough regeneration policy = mixed-use support

## **Limitations**
- Precedent site-specific (may not transfer perfectly)
- Low activity may indicate hidden constraints
- Option negotiation skills required
- 12-18 month planning timeline
- NIMBY opposition risk (height objections)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-4:** Run filter, desktop due diligence (Land Registry, planning portal)
2. **Weeks 5-8:** Shortlist 10 sites, approach owners with option proposal
3. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate options (12-24 months, £30k-£50k, planning-contingent)
4. **Months 4-6:** Engage planners (£30k-£50k), pre-app citing precedent
5. **Months 7-18:** Submit application, manage process
6. **Months 19-20:** Market to housebuilders, assign option
7. **Exit:** Sell with consent £800k-£1.2M vs £200k land value

**Profit:** £30k option + £50k planning = £80k → sell £1M = **£920k profit × 2-3 deals = £1.84M-£2.76M**

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Option agreements (2 sites): £60,000-£100,000
- Planning consultancy: £60,000-£100,000 (both sites)
- Legals: £20,000-£40,000
- **Total:** £140,000-£240,000 (⚠️ need to phase sites to stay under £200k)

# **APPROACH 2: HMO License Expiry - Regulatory Forced Motivation**

**Status:** ✅ **VALID**  
**Original LLM:** Claude (confirmed by Grok)  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8A (HMO License Expiry)  
**Capital Required:** £160,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-01-01
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
4. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
5. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
6. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
7. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
```

## **Rationale**

**Regulatory deadline pressure** = non-negotiable forced motivation. Owner dilemma:
- Expired license = illegal to operate (£5k-£30k enforcement fines)
- Low EPC (E-G) = cannot rent (MEES regs, £5k fine)
- Long hold (15+ years) = tired landlord
- Renewal cost: £10k-£50k (license + EPC + fire regs)
- **OR:** Sell at discount to you

## **Strengths**
- Forced action (cannot wait out enforcement)
- Time pressure (fines accumulating)
- Double motivation (expired license + EPC)
- Cash buyer advantage (speed premium)
- Income during hold (5-8% yield)
- Multiple exits (hold/flip/convert)

## **Limitations**
- Small pool (10-20 per city)
- Renewal costs £27k-£37k (reduces margin)
- Article 4 areas excluded (manual check needed)
- Structural/fire issues possible
- Volume strategy (need 18-30 deals for £2M)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter (focus: Newham, Brent, Ealing, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Contact owners directly (off-market, Land Registry lookup)
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Pitch: "Renewal £10k-£50k + void + fines vs our cash + speed"
4. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate 20-30% discount
5. **Months 4-6:** Renew license £2k, EPC £15k-£25k, fire regs £10k-£15k
6. **Exit A:** Hold for 6% net yield × 5 years
7. **Exit B:** Flip to HMO investor £280k-£320k (6 months)

**Profit:** £170k acquisition + £27k compliance = £197k → sell £280k = **£83k × 24 deals = £1.99M**

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition: £150,000-£180,000 (20-30% discount)
- HMO license: £2,000-£3,000
- EPC improvement: £15,000-£25,000
- Fire regs: £10,000-£15,000
- Legals/surveys: £5,000-£10,000
- **Total:** £182,000-£233,000 (⚠️ need to negotiate to £200k)

# **APPROACH 3: HMO Conversion - Large C3 to HMO Upside**

**Status:** ✅ **VALID**  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 22A (HMO Conversion)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-45 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
2. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

## **Rationale**

**Value-add conversion** (not distressed rescue like Approach 2). Exploits:
- Oversized C3 (>2000 sqft) = 6-8 bed HMO potential
- Poor EPC = cannot rent (MEES), needs £20k-£40k = motivation
- Unbroken freehold = no leasehold friction (Pattern 23B)
- Stale planning = passive ownership
- **Yield arbitrage:** 3-bed BTL 3-4% → 6-8 bed HMO 6-9% (+150% income)

## **Strengths**
- Clean acquisition (single negotiation)
- EPC pressure = discount motivation
- Clear HMO scale (proven room count)
- Yield uplift 2-3× on same asset
- Planning risk lower (C3→C4 often permitted)
- Market liquidity (sell to investors or families)

## **Limitations**
- Article 4 manual check (post-export)
- EPC F/G may = heavy capex (£30k-£50k)
- Floor area data gaps (Rightmove scrape needed)
- Amenity space standards vary
- Conversion costs £40k-£60k
- License saturation in some areas

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, cross-check Article 4 register
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Desktop screening (floor plans, room count viability)
3. **Weeks 5-8:** Approach owners ("EPC problem, needs £30k, we offer cash")
4. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate 10-20% discount
5. **Months 4-6:** Convert: EPC £20k-£30k, HMO fit-out £20k-£30k
6. **Months 7-8:** HMO license, rent (6-8 beds @ £600/month = £43k-£58k gross)
7. **Exit A:** Hold for 8% net × 5 years
8. **Exit B:** Flip to investor £310k (12 months)

**Profit:** £160k + £50k conversion = £210k → sell £310k = **£100k × 20 = £2M**

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition: £140,000-£180,000
- EPC: £20,000-£30,000
- HMO conversion: £20,000-£30,000
- License/legals: £3,000-£5,000
- Contingency: £7,000-£10,000
- **Total:** £190,000-£255,000 (target EPC E to stay under £200k)

# **APPROACH 4: Fresh Planning Consent Arbitrage**

**Status:** ✅ **VALID**  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 13A (Fresh Planning Consents)  
**Capital Required:** £50,000-£200,000 (flexible)  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties (UK-wide)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Last application submitted: is after 2025-11-15
2. Max number of dwellings applied for: is greater than 20
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.25 AND less than 1.5
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
7. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Flood Zone 3]
```

**⚠️ Adjust line 1 to 7-10 days before search date** (SearchLand updates weekly)

## **Rationale**

**TIME-SENSITIVE INFORMATION ARBITRAGE** - the only approach exploiting SearchLand's refresh cycle, not precedent/motivation.

**Mechanics:**
- Fresh approvals (24-48 hours) = owner unaware of value jump
- Land £200k → land with consent £800k-£1.2M
- **7-day window** before agents contact owner
- You contact Monday, agents contact Tuesday/Wednesday (first wins)

## **Strengths**
- Information asymmetry (owner thinks land value, not development value)
- Broad applicability (all development types)
- Low capital per site (options £5k-£10k)
- Fast execution (24-48 hour window)
- Repeatable (weekly refresh = continuous flow)
- Low competition (most developers wait for listings)

## **Limitations**
- Daily monitoring required (cannot batch)
- Competition from sophisticated developers
- Appeals risk (6 weeks judicial review)
- Geographic spread (UK-wide = travel costs)
- Short window (7-10 days before market pricing)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Daily:** Monitor SearchLand (adjust date to 7 days prior)
2. **Day 1:** Identify 20-50 fresh approvals, prioritize by GDV
3. **Day 2:** Contact owners immediately (Land Registry + Companies House)
4. **Days 3-5:** Negotiate options (£5k-£10k, "certain cash vs uncertain marketing")
5. **Days 6-10:** Secure 3-5 options (£15k-£50k total)
6. **Weeks 2-4:** Select strongest, flip option to developer
7. **Exit A:** Flip option £10k → sell £150k = **£140k × 3 = £420k** (repeat 4-5× yearly = **£1.68M-£2.1M**)
8. **Exit B:** Exercise £150k + flip £1M = **£840k × 2-3 = £1.68M-£2.52M**

## **Capital Breakdown**

**Strategy A (Option Flipping):**
- Options (5 sites): £25,000-£50,000
- Due diligence: £5,000-£10,000
- Legals: £5,000-£10,000
- **Total:** £35,000-£70,000 (high ROI)

**Strategy B (Acquisition):**
- Option: £5,000-£10,000
- Acquisition: £120,000-£180,000
- Legals: £10,000-£15,000
- **Total:** £135,000-£205,000

# **APPROACH 5: Airspace Rights - Flat Roof Intensification**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (structural risk, 30-40% failure rate)  
**Original LLM:** Gemini (refined from 3-LLM convergence)  
**Pattern:** Pattern 6A + Pattern 23B  
**Capital Required:** £130,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-40 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
7. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.75
9. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
```

## **Rationale**

**Structural arbitrage:** Purchase airspace rights (20-40% of freehold value) vs full ownership.

**Critical refinement:** Line 3 (`Number of leaseholds: 0`) eliminates #1 deal-killer (Pattern 23B from LEARNINGS_DATABASE).

**⚠️ WARNING:** 30-40% of sites fail structural survey (£10k-£15k sunk cost). Budget for multiple tests.

## **Strengths**
- Very low capital (£100k vs £500k freehold)
- Landowner keeps income (easier negotiation)
- Policy support (housing crisis, London Plan H2)
- Flat roof = lower costs (no reconstruction)
- Unbroken freehold = no leasehold negotiation

## **Limitations**
- **⚠️ CRITICAL:** 30-40% fail structural survey (non-recoverable £10k-£15k)
- Party wall agreements (2-6 month delay)
- Fire regs (second staircase £80k-£150k)
- Construction disruption (limits contractors)
- Right to light claims (BRE guidelines strict)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Weeks 1-3:** Run filter (London, Reading, Slough, Brighton)
2. **Weeks 4-6:** Desktop screening (roof verification)
3. **Weeks 7-10:** Approach freeholders (profit-share: 30%/70%)
4. **Weeks 11-14:** Negotiate airspace (£80k-£120k, conditional on structural survey)
5. **Months 4-5:** **CRITICAL:** Structural survey (if fails, abort)
6. **Months 6-8:** If pass, architect design (4-5 storeys)
7. **Months 9-14:** Planning application
8. **Exit:** Sell airspace + consent £600k-£1M = **£400k-£850k profit**

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Airspace purchase: £80,000-£120,000
- Structural survey: £10,000-£15,000 (⚠️ budget for 2-3 failures)
- Architectural/planning: £30,000-£50,000
- Legals: £10,000-£15,000
- **Total:** £140,000-£210,000 (⚠️ over £200k if multiple surveys)

**⚠️ CONDITIONAL:** Only proceed if comfortable with 30-40% failure rate.

# **APPROACH 6: Liquidation Arbitrage**

**Status:** ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL** (tiny pool, test if ≥5 results)  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration)  
**Capital Required:** £130,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties (may be <5)

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Building on title is derelict: Yes
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

## **Rationale**

**Maximum motivation:** Liquidators legally obligated to sell (forced sale).

- Speed over price (time = cost for liquidators)
- No emotional attachment (corporate)
- Clear decision-maker (liquidator authority)
- 20-40% discount typical
- Derelict = double motivation (no income + liability)

**⚠️ WARNING:** Very small pool (<10 typical). Only proceed if SearchLand returns ≥5 viable results.

## **Strengths**
- Strongest motivation possible (forced sale)
- Fast decisions (liquidators can't wait)
- Below-market pricing (20-40% discount)
- Clear legal process (no gazumping)
- Cash buyer advantage (speed leverage)

## **Limitations**
- **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Very limited pool (may yield <5 results)
- Properties often have issues (structural, contamination)
- Other creditor claims (check charges register)
- Time-pressured due diligence (4-6 weeks)
- Refurb/remediation costs (£50k-£100k)

## **Implementation Strategy**

1. **Week 1:** Run filter - **if <5 results, ABORT approach**
2. **Weeks 2-3:** Research company status, contact liquidator directly
3. **Weeks 4-5:** Desktop due diligence (charges, contamination risk)
4. **Week 6:** Offer 20-30% below market (emphasize cash + speed)
5. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate, conduct surveys
6. **Weeks 11-14:** Fast-track completion
7. **Exit A:** Apply planning → sell £600k = **£400k profit × 4 = £1.6M**
8. **Exit B:** Flip as-is £250k = **£100k profit × 10 = £1M**

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition: £120,000-£180,000
- Surveys: £5,000-£10,000
- Legals: £5,000-£10,000
- Contingency: £0-£20,000
- **Total:** £130,000-£200,000

**⚠️ CONDITIONAL:** Only proceed if SearchLand returns ≥5 results.

✅ **FULLY VALID (Test Immediately):**
- Approach 1: Precedent Replication (4/4 LLM consensus)
- Approach 2: HMO License Expiry
- Approach 3: HMO Conversion
- Approach 4: Fresh Consent Arbitrage

⚠️ **CONDITIONAL:**
- Approach 5: Airspace (30-40% structural failure, budget multiple surveys)
- Approach 6: Liquidation (test if ≥5 results)

❌ **EXCLUDED:**
- Claude-D: Legacy Holdings (2-5 years too long)
- Grok-A: Over-filtered (duplicates Claude-A)
- Gemini-A: Option structure requires £900k+ (not £200k)

---

### **Recommended Testing Sequence**

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Highest Probability**
1. **Approach 1** (Precedent) - 4/4 LLM consensus = strongest signal
2. **Approach 4** (Fresh Consent) - fastest ROI (4-6 weeks)

**Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Regulatory Arbitrage**
3. **Approach 2** (HMO Expiry) - forced motivation
4. **Approach 3** (HMO Conversion) - value-add

**Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Conditional**
5. **Approach 6** (Liquidation) - only if ≥5 results
6. **Approach 5** (Airspace) - only if comfortable with failure rate

---

### **Key Learnings**

**Convergence Insights:**
- **4/4 LLMs** → Precedent replication = strongest signal
- **3/4 LLMs** → Airspace (but all flagged structural risk)
- **3/4 LLMs** → HMO regulation (confirmed arbitrage)

**Critical Refinements:**
- Pattern 23B: Added `Number of leaseholds: 0` (prevents #1 airspace killer)
- Article 4: Manual check post-export (HMO approaches)
- Structural contingency: £10k-£15k for airspace failures
- Fresh consent timing: 7-day window before market pricing

**Diversity Preserved:** 6 distinct strategies (not forced convergence)
