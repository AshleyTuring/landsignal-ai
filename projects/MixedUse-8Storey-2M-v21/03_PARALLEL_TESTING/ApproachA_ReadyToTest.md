# **APPROACH A: Precedent Replication - 8-Storey Mixed-Use**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £60,000-£120,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
10. Building on title is inactive: Yes
```

## **Rationale**
The approved 8-storey mixed-use development in Slough provides **proven planning precedent**. This approach replicates success by targeting:
- Similar use class combinations (E retail + C3 residential)
- Sites currently low-rise (<15m = ~4 storeys) with intensification potential
- Transport accessibility supporting density policy
- Long-hold properties indicating unmotivated/passive ownership
- Inactive buildings suggesting stalled development

## **Strengths**
- Precedent reduces planning risk (local authority pre-approved similar scheme)
- Low capital via option agreements (£30k-£50k vs £500k+ outright purchase)
- Transport proximity supports planning policy for intensification
- Inactive buildings = motivation signal (no income, potential sell pressure)
- Slough regeneration focus aligns with mixed-use policy support

## **Limitations**
- Precedent may not transfer perfectly to different sites (microclimate planning)
- Low planning activity may indicate hidden planning challenges
- Requires negotiation skills for option agreements
- Planning process 12-18 months (longer timeline)
- Local opposition risk (NIMBYism for height)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Weeks 1-4:** Run SearchLand filter, export results, conduct desktop due diligence (Land Registry, planning portal)
2. **Weeks 5-8:** Shortlist 10 sites with best precedent match, approach owners with option proposal
3. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate option agreements (12-24 month term, £30k-£50k fee, planning-contingent)
4. **Months 4-6:** Engage planning consultancy, prepare pre-app consultation with LPA
5. **Months 7-18:** Submit planning application citing Slough precedent, manage process
6. **Months 19-20:** Upon approval, market to housebuilders/developers, complete sale
7. **Exit:** Assign option or complete purchase + immediate sale at planning premium

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Option agreement: £30,000-£50,000
- Planning consultancy: £30,000-£50,000
- Legals: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £60,000-£120,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

1. Copy SearchLand AI prompt above
2. Paste screenshot of what SearchLand AI actually created
3. Run validation script to check accuracy (compare intended vs actual)
4. Update prompts based on issues + update LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md
5. Document results & property screenshots

Then continue to Stage 5 (Site Validation) and Stage 6 (Deep Research).
