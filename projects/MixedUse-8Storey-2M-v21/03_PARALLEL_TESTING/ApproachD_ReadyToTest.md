```

## **Rationale**
Combines **two powerful motivation signals**:
1. **Never sold** = inherited/legacy holding (owner may not know value, estate planning motivation)
2. **Edge of settlement** = strategic land promotion opportunity (local plan inclusion potential)

Properties with "no latest sold date" pre-date Land Registry computerization (pre-1990s) or are inherited holdings. Owners often:
- Elderly, non-professional landlords
- Unaware of development value (think agricultural land prices)
- Motivated by estate planning, tax liability, or offloading burden
- No recent activity (<1 app 5 years) = passive holding

## **Strengths**
- **Hidden gems** (owners don't market, not on developer radar)
- Low EPC = additional motivation (cannot rent, needs improvement)
- Edge of settlement = natural expansion direction (planning logic)
- Patient capital strategy (2-5 year timeline, but massive returns)
- Multiple sites = portfolio diversification (not reliant on single deal)
- Option structure = minimal capital per site (£4k-£6k)

## **Limitations**
- **Very long timeline** (2-5 years for local plan allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation (local authority decision, not certain)
- Owners may be difficult to locate (unregistered, no marketing history)
- Requires planning promotion expertise (consultancy essential)
- Some sites may have issues preventing allocation (infrastructure, flood risk)
- Low volume of results (never-sold properties rare)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Months 1-3:** Run filter, identify 30-50 never-sold edge sites
2. **Months 4-6:** Land Registry searches to identify owners, approach with patient capital pitch
3. **Months 7-9:** Negotiate option agreements (£4k-£6k per site, 3-5 year term, promotion-contingent)
4. **Months 10-12:** Engage planning consultancy, prepare promotion documents (SHLAA, site assessments)
5. **Year 2:** Submit sites to local authority for SHLAA/local plan call for sites
6. **Years 2-4:** Participate in local plan process (consultations, examinations)
7. **Year 4-5:** Sites allocated in adopted local plan (value jump from £50k/acre to £300k-£500k/acre)
8. **Exit Strategy A:** Sell options with allocation to housebuilders (£150k-£300k per site)
9. **Exit Strategy B:** Apply for planning consent, sell with consent (£400k-£800k per site, adds 12-18 months)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Option agreements (multiple sites): £30,000-£60,000
- Planning promotion consultancy: £40,000-£80,000
- Legals: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £80,000-£160,000
