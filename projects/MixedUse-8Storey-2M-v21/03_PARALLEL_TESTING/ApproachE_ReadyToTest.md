# **APPROACH E: HMO License Expiry Arbitrage**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8A (HMO License Expiry) + Pattern 2A (Long Hold + Motivation)  
**Capital Required:** £160,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-01-01
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
4. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
5. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
6. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
7. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
```

## **Rationale**
Exploits **regulatory deadline pressure** combined with **tired landlord signals**:
- **Expired HMO license** = illegal to operate (cannot rent until renewed, £1k-£3k renewal + compliance costs)
- **Low EPC (E-G)** = double regulatory pressure (cannot rent below E since 2020, improvement £5k-£50k)
- **Long hold (sold before 2010)** = 15+ years ownership, tired landlord likely
- **NOT Article 4** = can renew license if owner wants (avoids dead-end situations)

Owner's dilemma: Spend £10k-£50k (renewal + EPC improvement + compliance) OR sell and exit

## **Strengths**
- **Forced action** (expired license = cannot operate legally)
- **Time pressure** (local authority enforcement risk)
- Tired landlord (15+ years ownership = may want exit)
- Low EPC = double motivation (two regulatory problems)
- Cash buyer advantage (speed = premium in distressed scenarios)
- Can operate as HMO post-purchase (income during hold period)
- Multiple exit strategies (hold for yield, flip to investor, convert to C3)

## **Limitations**
- **Limited pool** (expired licenses rare, LAs enforce renewals)
- Renewal costs reduce margin (£2k license + £15k-£25k EPC)
- Article 4 areas excluded (can't renew even if we want)
- Some HMOs may have structural/fire safety issues (survey critical)
- Local authority may not renew license (enforcement history, saturation)
- Volume strategy required (£68k-£113k profit per deal = need many deals)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, prioritize areas with mandatory HMO licensing (London boroughs, university towns)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Contact owners directly (expired license = not marketed, off-market opportunity)
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Emphasize owner's pain: "Renewal costs £10k-£50k, enforcement risk, let us solve your problem"
4. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate purchase at 20-30% discount (owner avoids renewal costs + time)
5. **Weeks 11-14:** Legal completion (fast-track, cash buyer advantage)
6. **Months 4-6:** Renew HMO license (£2k), complete EPC improvements (£15k-£25k)
7. **Exit Strategy A:** Hold for rental yield (5-8% gross yield, £12k-£18k annual income)
8. **Exit Strategy B:** Sell to HMO investor at £280k-£320k (£68k-£113k profit, 6-month turnaround)
9. **Exit Strategy C:** Convert to C3 single dwelling if market supports (removes HMO stigma)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition (discounted): £150,000-£180,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £160,000-£200,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

# **APPROACH GEMINI-B: Strategic Airspace Development (Zero Leaseholds)**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace) + Pattern 23B (No Lease Complications)  
**Capital Required:** £195,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-40 properties

**CONDITIONAL REASON:** Structural capacity risk (same as Approach C). **KEY DISTINCTION:** This approach explicitly targets **zero leaseholds**, which is a critical learning from LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md and eliminates negotiation complexity.

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other, Residential Accommodation]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, National Landscapes (AONB)]
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.75
```

## **Rationale**
This strategy directly targets airspace development with **Pattern 23B (No Lease Complications)** - a critical lesson from LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md. The key improvement over standard airspace approaches:
- **Zero leaseholds** = single negotiation (no tenant/leaseholder complications)
- **Unbroken freehold** = clean legal structure
- Eliminates immense complexity of negotiating with multiple parties

Focus on urban centres outside London (Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol) for value.

## **Strengths**
- **Extremely capital efficient** (airspace rights 20-40% of freehold value)
- **Zero leaseholder complexity** (critical advantage per LEARNINGS_DATABASE)
- **Reduced negotiation risk** (single freeholder, not dozens of leaseholders)
- Sustainable (re-uses existing structures)
- High-value locations (urban centres with proven demand)
- Regulatory arbitrage (exploits density vs existing value gap)

## **Limitations**
- **Structural risk** (existing building may not support additional floors - £10k-£15k survey critical)
- Right to light (neighboring properties may have claims)
- Construction complexity (building on occupied structure)
- Freeholder negotiation (may have inflated sense of value)
- Fire regulation (adding height = second staircases, expensive compliance)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Source:** Execute SearchLand query across major UK cities (Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, Birmingham)
2. **Desktop Diligence:** Prioritize based on location, building form, massing potential (Google Street View inspection)
3. **Approach Freeholder:** Direct approach with airspace purchase proposal, conditional on structural survey
4. **Technical Assessment:** Full structural survey (load-bearing capacity), commission architectural feasibility designs (adding 3-5 storeys)
5. **Acquire & Plan:** Purchase airspace rights, submit detailed planning application for vertical extension
6. **Exit/Develop:**
   - **Option A (Sell):** Sell project (airspace + consent) to specialist developer
   - **Option B (JV/Finance):** Secure development finance or JV partner to fund construction, retain significant portion of £2M+ profit

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Airspace Rights Purchase: £120,000
- Structural Engineering Survey & Report: £15,000
- Architectural & Planning Consultant Fees: £50,000
- Legal Fees: £10,000
- **Total:** £195,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

**IMPORTANT:** Budget £15k for structural survey BEFORE committing full capital. Survey results are go/no-go decision point.

# **APPROACH CODEX-B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 22A (HMO Conversion)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-45 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
2. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

## **Rationale**
Targets oversized single C3 units with poor EPC (regulation-driven motivation) and unbroken titles (no leaseholder friction). Stale planning history reduces objection risk; >2000 sqft supports 6-8 bed HMOs delivering 5-8% yield vs BTL 3-4%.

**KEY DISTINCTION from Approach E:** This is an **acquisition + conversion model** (buy large C3, convert to HMO), whereas Approach E is **expired license arbitrage** (buy existing HMO with expired license at discount).

## **Strengths**
- Low acquisition friction (freehold, no leaseholds)
- EPC pressure motivates discount
- Clear HMO scale and room count viability (>2000 sqft = 6-8 beds)
- Minimal planning history simplifies conversion
- Higher yield potential (5-8% vs BTL 3-4%)

## **Limitations**
- Licensing/Article 4 pockets must be checked manually post-export
- EPC F/G may imply heavier capex
- Floor area data may be missing on some records
- Local amenity space standards vary

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. Map Article 4 areas; exclude manually post-export
2. Offer fast completion to EPC-stressed owners; use bridge + refurb
3. Pre-app or certificate-of-lawfulness where layout stays C3→C4/Sui Generis thresholds
4. Phase works: fabric/EPC upgrade first, then HMO-specific fit-out

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Deposit/bridge costs within £200k cap: £80,000
- Refurb/HMO compliance (FD30 doors, LD2 alarms, EPC uplift): £50,000
- Professional fees/licence/planning: £10,000
- Contingency: £10,000
- **Total:** £150,000

## **Next Steps**

# **APPROACH GROK-C: HMO License Deadline Exploitation (On-Market)**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Grok  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8A (HMO Expired Licenses)  
**Capital Required:** £200,000  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Currently has HMO: is equal to Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-11-24
3. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5
5. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
8. Sales listing currently on the market: is equal to Yes
```

## **Rationale**
This regulation-driven approach targets HMOs with expired licenses, creating forced seller motivation as properties cannot legally operate. 

**KEY DISTINCTION from Approach E:** This approach specifically targets **on-market listings** (seller already motivated to sell), whereas Approach E targets off-market opportunities (requires owner outreach).

With £200k capital, can buy distressed HMOs, renew licenses cheaply (£1k-£3k), and convert/hold for rental income or sell at market value, achieving £2M profit through volume and yield.

## **Strengths**
- Strong motivation (cannot operate without renewal)
- **On-market listings ensure immediate availability** (faster execution)
- Low capital for distressed assets
- Transport proximity supports HMO demand
- Clear seller intent (already listed = want to sell)

## **Limitations**
- Limited to HMO-specific properties
- May require compliance work before operation
- Geographic restrictions in Article 4 areas
- Competition from other HMO operators
- On-market = may face bidding competition

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. Filter for expired HMO licenses and review 15-40 active listings
2. Approach owners with renewal offers or direct purchase proposals
3. Acquire distressed HMOs within £180k budget
4. Renew licenses and perform basic improvements with £20k
5. Convert to optimized HMO or hold for 5-8% yield, exiting for £2M profit
6. Scale by targeting multiple licenses in parallel

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition: £180,000
- License renewal/conversion: £20,000
- **Total:** £200,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**
