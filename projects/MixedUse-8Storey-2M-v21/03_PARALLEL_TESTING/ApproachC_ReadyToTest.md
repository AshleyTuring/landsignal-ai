# **APPROACH C: Airspace Rights Acquisition**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace Development)  
**Capital Required:** £130,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**CONDITIONAL REASON:** Structural capacity unknown until survey (£10k-£15k cost, risk if unsuitable). Recommend testing filter but flag structural validation as critical go/no-go before proceeding.

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.8
6. Number of buildings on title: is equal to 1
7. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
10. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
```

## **Rationale**
Targets **structural arbitrage** - purchasing airspace rights above existing low-rise buildings rather than full property ownership. Key insight:
- Flat roofs = easier structural addition (no hip/gable complications)
- <12m height = ~3-4 storeys, significant headroom for 8-storey target
- High PTAL (4-6) = policy support for density intensification
- Freehold = single negotiation (no head lease complications)
- Single building = simpler structural assessment

## **Strengths**
- **Very low capital** (airspace rights 20-40% of freehold value)
- Landowner keeps ground floor income (easier negotiation)
- High PTAL = strong planning policy support for density
- Flat roof = lower structural costs (no roof reconstruction)
- Growing strategy (housing crisis = policy push for airspace)
- Fast planning (if policy-compliant, 6-12 months)

## **Limitations**
- **Structural capacity unknown** until survey (£10k-£15k cost, risk if unsuitable)
- Party wall agreements required (neighbor complications)
- Freeholder negotiation essential (no leasehold airspace without consent)
- Fire safety regulations stringent (post-Grenfell, expensive compliance)
- Construction noise/disruption (existing occupiers may object)
- Requires specialist structural engineer and architect (£30k-£50k fees)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Weeks 1-3:** Run filter (focus on London, Reading, Slough, Brighton - high PTAL areas)
2. **Weeks 4-6:** Desktop screening (OS maps for roof type, Google Streetview for condition)
3. **Weeks 7-10:** Approach freeholders with airspace proposal (profit-share or fixed fee)
4. **Weeks 11-14:** Negotiate airspace option/purchase (£80k-£120k)
5. **Months 4-6:** **CRITICAL GATE:** Structural survey (load-bearing capacity), engage architect for scheme design
6. **Months 7-12:** Submit planning application (4-5 additional storeys citing PTAL/density policy)
7. **Months 13-15:** Upon planning approval, market airspace with consent to developers
8. **Exit:** Sell airspace rights + planning consent for £600k-£1M (no construction required)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Airspace rights purchase: £80,000-£120,000
- Planning costs: £40,000-£60,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £130,000-£200,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

**IMPORTANT:** Budget £10k-£15k for structural survey BEFORE committing full capital. Survey results are go/no-go decision point.
