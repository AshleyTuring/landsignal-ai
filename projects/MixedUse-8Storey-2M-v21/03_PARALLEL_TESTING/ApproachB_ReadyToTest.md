## **Rationale**
Exploits **maximum behavioral motivation** - companies in liquidation/administration are **legally obligated to sell assets** to repay creditors. Key advantages:
- Liquidators prioritize speed over price (time = cost)
- No emotional attachment (corporate sellers)
- Clear decision-maker (liquidator has authority)
- Often 20-40% below market value due to distressed circumstances
- Derelict buildings = double motivation (no income + liabilities)

## **Strengths**
- **Strongest motivation signal** (forced sale = maximum leverage)
- Fast decision-making (liquidators can't wait)
- Below-market pricing typical (20-40% discount)
- Clear legal process (no gazumping, no chain)
- Cash buyers highly preferred (speed advantage)
- Derelict buildings = value-add opportunity (planning upside)

## **Limitations**
- **Very limited pool** (liquidations rare, <10 results per LPA typical)
- Properties often have issues (structural, contamination, legal complications)
- Other creditors may have claims (secured vs unsecured debt hierarchy)
- Due diligence time-pressured (liquidators want quick completion)
- May require significant refurb/remediation (reduce profit margin)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter, identify 5-15 liquidation/administration cases
2. **Weeks 2-3:** Research company status (Companies House), contact liquidator/administrator directly
3. **Weeks 4-5:** Desktop due diligence (title search, planning history, contamination risk assessment)
4. **Week 6:** Submit offers (20-30% below market, emphasize cash + speed)
5. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate with liquidator, conduct surveys (structural, environmental)
6. **Weeks 11-14:** Legal completion (fast-track conveyancing)
7. **Months 4-12:** Apply for planning consent OR sell immediately to developer as-is
8. **Exit Strategy A:** Sell with planning at £400k-£600k (£250k-£450k profit)
9. **Exit Strategy B:** Flip as-is to developer at £250k-£300k (£100k-£150k profit, faster)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition (distressed pricing): £120,000-£180,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £130,000-£200,000
