## Approach A: Precedent Replication - 8-Storey Mixed-Use


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 3A (Similar Planning Approvals)  
**Capital Required:** £60,000-£120,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-30 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Proposal: contains "mixed-use" AND "storey"
2. Proposal: contains "retail" OR "commercial"
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.15 AND less than 1.5
5. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1000
7. Latest sold date: is before 2015-01-01
8. Applications in the last 5 years: is less than 3
9. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, Flood Zone 3]
10. Building on title is inactive: Yes
```

## **Rationale**
The approved 8-storey mixed-use development in Slough provides **proven planning precedent**. This approach replicates success by targeting:
- Similar use class combinations (E retail + C3 residential)
- Sites currently low-rise (<15m = ~4 storeys) with intensification potential
- Transport accessibility supporting density policy
- Long-hold properties indicating unmotivated/passive ownership
- Inactive buildings suggesting stalled development

## **Strengths**
- Precedent reduces planning risk (local authority pre-approved similar scheme)
- Low capital via option agreements (£30k-£50k vs £500k+ outright purchase)
- Transport proximity supports planning policy for intensification
- Inactive buildings = motivation signal (no income, potential sell pressure)
- Slough regeneration focus aligns with mixed-use policy support

## **Limitations**
- Precedent may not transfer perfectly to different sites (microclimate planning)
- Low planning activity may indicate hidden planning challenges
- Requires negotiation skills for option agreements
- Planning process 12-18 months (longer timeline)
- Local opposition risk (NIMBYism for height)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Weeks 1-4:** Run SearchLand filter, export results, conduct desktop due diligence (Land Registry, planning portal)
2. **Weeks 5-8:** Shortlist 10 sites with best precedent match, approach owners with option proposal
3. **Weeks 9-12:** Negotiate option agreements (12-24 month term, £30k-£50k fee, planning-contingent)
4. **Months 4-6:** Engage planning consultancy, prepare pre-app consultation with LPA
5. **Months 7-18:** Submit planning application citing Slough precedent, manage process
6. **Months 19-20:** Upon approval, market to housebuilders/developers, complete sale
7. **Exit:** Assign option or complete purchase + immediate sale at planning premium

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Option agreement: £30,000-£50,000
- Planning consultancy: £30,000-£50,000
- Legals: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £60,000-£120,000

## **Next Steps**

## Approach B: Liquidation Arbitrage - Forced Sales


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration Sales)  
**Capital Required:** £130,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 5-15 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Ownership type: is equal to Company
2. Company status: is one of [Liquidation, In Administration]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.2 AND less than 2
4. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses, B2 - General industrial, B8 - Storage or distribution]
5. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
6. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland]
7. Building on title is derelict: Yes
8. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 70
```

## **Rationale**
Exploits **maximum behavioral motivation** - companies in liquidation/administration are **legally obligated to sell assets** to repay creditors. Key advantages:
- Liquidators prioritize speed over price (time = cost)
- No emotional attachment (corporate sellers)
- Clear decision-maker (liquidator has authority)
- Often 20-40% below market value due to distressed circumstances
- Derelict buildings = double motivation (no income + liabilities)

## **Strengths**
- **Strongest motivation signal** (forced sale = maximum leverage)
- Fast decision-making (liquidators can't wait)
- Below-market pricing typical (20-40% discount)
- Clear legal process (no gazumping, no chain)
- Cash buyers highly preferred (speed advantage)
- Derelict buildings = value-add opportunity (planning upside)

## **Limitations**
- **Very limited pool** (liquidations rare, <10 results per LPA typical)
- Properties often have issues (structural, contamination, legal complications)
- Other creditors may have claims (secured vs unsecured debt hierarchy)
- Due diligence time-pressured (liquidators want quick completion)
- May require significant refurb/remediation (reduce profit margin)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Week 1:** Run filter, identify 5-15 liquidation/administration cases
2. **Weeks 2-3:** Research company status (Companies House), contact liquidator/administrator directly
3. **Weeks 4-5:** Desktop due diligence (title search, planning history, contamination risk assessment)
4. **Week 6:** Submit offers (20-30% below market, emphasize cash + speed)
5. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate with liquidator, conduct surveys (structural, environmental)
6. **Weeks 11-14:** Legal completion (fast-track conveyancing)
7. **Months 4-12:** Apply for planning consent OR sell immediately to developer as-is
8. **Exit Strategy A:** Sell with planning at £400k-£600k (£250k-£450k profit)
9. **Exit Strategy B:** Flip as-is to developer at £250k-£300k (£100k-£150k profit, faster)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition (distressed pricing): £120,000-£180,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £130,000-£200,000

## Approach C: Airspace Rights Acquisition


**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace Development)  
**Capital Required:** £130,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 15-40 properties

**CONDITIONAL REASON:** Structural capacity unknown until survey (£10k-£15k cost, risk if unsuitable). Recommend testing filter but flag structural validation as critical go/no-go before proceeding.

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Max building height on title (m): is less than 12
3. Use class: contains any [E - Commercial Business and Service, C3 - Dwellinghouses]
4. PTAL: contains any [4, 5, 6a, 6b (Best)]
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.8
6. Number of buildings on title: is equal to 1
7. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot]
9. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 80
10. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
```

## **Rationale**
Targets **structural arbitrage** - purchasing airspace rights above existing low-rise buildings rather than full property ownership. Key insight:
- Flat roofs = easier structural addition (no hip/gable complications)
- <12m height = ~3-4 storeys, significant headroom for 8-storey target
- High PTAL (4-6) = policy support for density intensification
- Freehold = single negotiation (no head lease complications)
- Single building = simpler structural assessment

## **Strengths**
- **Very low capital** (airspace rights 20-40% of freehold value)
- Landowner keeps ground floor income (easier negotiation)
- High PTAL = strong planning policy support for density
- Flat roof = lower structural costs (no roof reconstruction)
- Growing strategy (housing crisis = policy push for airspace)
- Fast planning (if policy-compliant, 6-12 months)

## **Limitations**
- **Structural capacity unknown** until survey (£10k-£15k cost, risk if unsuitable)
- Party wall agreements required (neighbor complications)
- Freeholder negotiation essential (no leasehold airspace without consent)
- Fire safety regulations stringent (post-Grenfell, expensive compliance)
- Construction noise/disruption (existing occupiers may object)
- Requires specialist structural engineer and architect (£30k-£50k fees)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Weeks 1-3:** Run filter (focus on London, Reading, Slough, Brighton - high PTAL areas)
2. **Weeks 4-6:** Desktop screening (OS maps for roof type, Google Streetview for condition)
3. **Weeks 7-10:** Approach freeholders with airspace proposal (profit-share or fixed fee)
4. **Weeks 11-14:** Negotiate airspace option/purchase (£80k-£120k)
5. **Months 4-6:** **CRITICAL GATE:** Structural survey (load-bearing capacity), engage architect for scheme design
6. **Months 7-12:** Submit planning application (4-5 additional storeys citing PTAL/density policy)
7. **Months 13-15:** Upon planning approval, market airspace with consent to developers
8. **Exit:** Sell airspace rights + planning consent for £600k-£1M (no construction required)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Airspace rights purchase: £80,000-£120,000
- Planning costs: £40,000-£60,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £130,000-£200,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

**IMPORTANT:** Budget £10k-£15k for structural survey BEFORE committing full capital. Survey results are go/no-go decision point.

## Approach D: Legacy Holdings + Edge of Settlement


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 14A (Legacy Holdings) + Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement Promotion)  
**Capital Required:** £80,000-£160,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-50 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. No latest sold date: Yes
2. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner]
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 1 AND less than 10
4. Less than 1 application in last 5 years: Yes
5. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
6. Percentage of plot un-constrained: is greater than 75
7. Distance to nearest adopted settlement boundary (m): is less than 200
8. Distance to nearest emerging settlement boundary (m): is less than 200
9. Developed area percentage: is less than 10
10. Planning constraints: does not contain [Flood Zone 3, SSSI, Ancient Woodland, National Parks]
```

## **Rationale**
Combines **two powerful motivation signals**:
1. **Never sold** = inherited/legacy holding (owner may not know value, estate planning motivation)
2. **Edge of settlement** = strategic land promotion opportunity (local plan inclusion potential)

Properties with "no latest sold date" pre-date Land Registry computerization (pre-1990s) or are inherited holdings. Owners often:
- Elderly, non-professional landlords
- Unaware of development value (think agricultural land prices)
- Motivated by estate planning, tax liability, or offloading burden
- No recent activity (<1 app 5 years) = passive holding

## **Strengths**
- **Hidden gems** (owners don't market, not on developer radar)
- Low EPC = additional motivation (cannot rent, needs improvement)
- Edge of settlement = natural expansion direction (planning logic)
- Patient capital strategy (2-5 year timeline, but massive returns)
- Multiple sites = portfolio diversification (not reliant on single deal)
- Option structure = minimal capital per site (£4k-£6k)

## **Limitations**
- **Very long timeline** (2-5 years for local plan allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation (local authority decision, not certain)
- Owners may be difficult to locate (unregistered, no marketing history)
- Requires planning promotion expertise (consultancy essential)
- Some sites may have issues preventing allocation (infrastructure, flood risk)
- Low volume of results (never-sold properties rare)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Months 1-3:** Run filter, identify 30-50 never-sold edge sites
2. **Months 4-6:** Land Registry searches to identify owners, approach with patient capital pitch
3. **Months 7-9:** Negotiate option agreements (£4k-£6k per site, 3-5 year term, promotion-contingent)
4. **Months 10-12:** Engage planning consultancy, prepare promotion documents (SHLAA, site assessments)
5. **Year 2:** Submit sites to local authority for SHLAA/local plan call for sites
6. **Years 2-4:** Participate in local plan process (consultations, examinations)
7. **Year 4-5:** Sites allocated in adopted local plan (value jump from £50k/acre to £300k-£500k/acre)
8. **Exit Strategy A:** Sell options with allocation to housebuilders (£150k-£300k per site)
9. **Exit Strategy B:** Apply for planning consent, sell with consent (£400k-£800k per site, adds 12-18 months)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Option agreements (multiple sites): £30,000-£60,000
- Planning promotion consultancy: £40,000-£80,000
- Legals: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £80,000-£160,000

## Approach E: HMO License Expiry Arbitrage


**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Claude  
**Pattern:** Pattern 8A (HMO License Expiry) + Pattern 2A (Long Hold + Motivation)  
**Capital Required:** £160,000-£200,000  
**Expected Results:** 8-20 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Currently has HMO: Yes
2. HMO License Expiry Date: is before 2025-01-01
3. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
4. EPC rating: contains any [E, F, G]
5. Latest sold date: is before 2010-01-01
6. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses, C4 - HMO]
7. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
8. Planning constraints: does not contain [Article 4 Directions]
9. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 1500
10. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.05 AND less than 0.3
```

## **Rationale**
Exploits **regulatory deadline pressure** combined with **tired landlord signals**:
- **Expired HMO license** = illegal to operate (cannot rent until renewed, £1k-£3k renewal + compliance costs)
- **Low EPC (E-G)** = double regulatory pressure (cannot rent below E since 2020, improvement £5k-£50k)
- **Long hold (sold before 2010)** = 15+ years ownership, tired landlord likely
- **NOT Article 4** = can renew license if owner wants (avoids dead-end situations)

Owner's dilemma: Spend £10k-£50k (renewal + EPC improvement + compliance) OR sell and exit

## **Strengths**
- **Forced action** (expired license = cannot operate legally)
- **Time pressure** (local authority enforcement risk)
- Tired landlord (15+ years ownership = may want exit)
- Low EPC = double motivation (two regulatory problems)
- Cash buyer advantage (speed = premium in distressed scenarios)
- Can operate as HMO post-purchase (income during hold period)
- Multiple exit strategies (hold for yield, flip to investor, convert to C3)

## **Limitations**
- **Limited pool** (expired licenses rare, LAs enforce renewals)
- Renewal costs reduce margin (£2k license + £15k-£25k EPC)
- Article 4 areas excluded (can't renew even if we want)
- Some HMOs may have structural/fire safety issues (survey critical)
- Local authority may not renew license (enforcement history, saturation)
- Volume strategy required (£68k-£113k profit per deal = need many deals)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Weeks 1-2:** Run filter, prioritize areas with mandatory HMO licensing (London boroughs, university towns)
2. **Weeks 3-4:** Contact owners directly (expired license = not marketed, off-market opportunity)
3. **Weeks 5-6:** Emphasize owner's pain: "Renewal costs £10k-£50k, enforcement risk, let us solve your problem"
4. **Weeks 7-10:** Negotiate purchase at 20-30% discount (owner avoids renewal costs + time)
5. **Weeks 11-14:** Legal completion (fast-track, cash buyer advantage)
6. **Months 4-6:** Renew HMO license (£2k), complete EPC improvements (£15k-£25k)
7. **Exit Strategy A:** Hold for rental yield (5-8% gross yield, £12k-£18k annual income)
8. **Exit Strategy B:** Sell to HMO investor at £280k-£320k (£68k-£113k profit, 6-month turnaround)
9. **Exit Strategy C:** Convert to C3 single dwelling if market supports (removes HMO stigma)

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition (discounted): £150,000-£180,000
- Legals/surveys: £10,000-£20,000
- **Total:** £160,000-£200,000

# **APPROACH GEMINI-B: Strategic Airspace Development (Zero Leaseholds)**

**Status:** ⚠️ CONDITIONAL  
**Original LLM:** Gemini  
**Pattern:** Pattern 6A (Airspace) + Pattern 23B (No Lease Complications)  
**Capital Required:** £195,000  
**Expected Results:** 10-40 properties

**CONDITIONAL REASON:** Structural capacity risk (same as Approach C). **KEY DISTINCTION:** This approach explicitly targets **zero leaseholds**, which is a critical learning from LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md and eliminates negotiation complexity.

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. A building in the title has flat roof: Yes
2. Tenure: is one of [Freehold]
3. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is equal to 0
4. Max building height on title (m): is less than 15
5. Building use group: contains any [Mixed Use, Commercial Activity: Other, Residential Accommodation]
6. Distance to nearest Train Station (m): is less than 800
7. Planning constraints: does not contain [Green Belt, Conservation Area, Listed Building(s) in plot, National Landscapes (AONB)]
8. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.75
```

## **Rationale**
This strategy directly targets airspace development with **Pattern 23B (No Lease Complications)** - a critical lesson from LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md. The key improvement over standard airspace approaches:
- **Zero leaseholds** = single negotiation (no tenant/leaseholder complications)
- **Unbroken freehold** = clean legal structure
- Eliminates immense complexity of negotiating with multiple parties

Focus on urban centres outside London (Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol) for value.

## **Strengths**
- **Extremely capital efficient** (airspace rights 20-40% of freehold value)
- **Zero leaseholder complexity** (critical advantage per LEARNINGS_DATABASE)
- **Reduced negotiation risk** (single freeholder, not dozens of leaseholders)
- Sustainable (re-uses existing structures)
- High-value locations (urban centres with proven demand)
- Regulatory arbitrage (exploits density vs existing value gap)

## **Limitations**
- **Structural risk** (existing building may not support additional floors - £10k-£15k survey critical)
- Right to light (neighboring properties may have claims)
- Construction complexity (building on occupied structure)
- Freeholder negotiation (may have inflated sense of value)
- Fire regulation (adding height = second staircases, expensive compliance)

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. **Source:** Execute SearchLand query across major UK cities (Manchester, Bristol, Leeds, Birmingham)
2. **Desktop Diligence:** Prioritize based on location, building form, massing potential (Google Street View inspection)
3. **Approach Freeholder:** Direct approach with airspace purchase proposal, conditional on structural survey
4. **Technical Assessment:** Full structural survey (load-bearing capacity), commission architectural feasibility designs (adding 3-5 storeys)
5. **Acquire & Plan:** Purchase airspace rights, submit detailed planning application for vertical extension
6. **Exit/Develop:**
   - **Option A (Sell):** Sell project (airspace + consent) to specialist developer
   - **Option B (JV/Finance):** Secure development finance or JV partner to fund construction, retain significant portion of £2M+ profit

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Airspace Rights Purchase: £120,000
- Structural Engineering Survey & Report: £15,000
- Architectural & Planning Consultant Fees: £50,000
- Legal Fees: £10,000
- **Total:** £195,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

**IMPORTANT:** Budget £15k for structural survey BEFORE committing full capital. Survey results are go/no-go decision point.

# **APPROACH CODEX-B: Large C3 to HMO Conversion**

**Status:** ✅ VALID  
**Original LLM:** Codex  
**Pattern:** Pattern 22A (HMO Conversion)  
**Capital Required:** £150,000  
**Expected Results:** 20-45 properties

## **SearchLand AI Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready)**

```
1. Property floor area (sqft): is greater than 2000
2. Use class: contains any [C3 - Dwellinghouses]
3. Tenure: is equal to Freehold
4. Number of leaseholds on the freehold: is less than 1
5. Ownership type: is one of [Private owner, Company]
6. EPC rating: is one of [E, F, G]
7. Planning applications in last 5 years: is less than 1
```

## **Rationale**
Targets oversized single C3 units with poor EPC (regulation-driven motivation) and unbroken titles (no leaseholder friction). Stale planning history reduces objection risk; >2000 sqft supports 6-8 bed HMOs delivering 5-8% yield vs BTL 3-4%.

**KEY DISTINCTION from Approach E:** This is an **acquisition + conversion model** (buy large C3, convert to HMO), whereas Approach E is **expired license arbitrage** (buy existing HMO with expired license at discount).

## **Strengths**
- Low acquisition friction (freehold, no leaseholds)
- EPC pressure motivates discount
- Clear HMO scale and room count viability (>2000 sqft = 6-8 beds)
- Minimal planning history simplifies conversion
- Higher yield potential (5-8% vs BTL 3-4%)

## **Limitations**
- Licensing/Article 4 pockets must be checked manually post-export
- EPC F/G may imply heavier capex
- Floor area data may be missing on some records
- Local amenity space standards vary

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. Map Article 4 areas; exclude manually post-export
2. Offer fast completion to EPC-stressed owners; use bridge + refurb
3. Pre-app or certificate-of-lawfulness where layout stays C3→C4/Sui Generis thresholds
4. Phase works: fabric/EPC upgrade first, then HMO-specific fit-out

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Deposit/bridge costs within £200k cap: £80,000
- Refurb/HMO compliance (FD30 doors, LD2 alarms, EPC uplift): £50,000
- Professional fees/licence/planning: £10,000
- Contingency: £10,000
- **Total:** £150,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

This regulation-driven approach targets HMOs with expired licenses, creating forced seller motivation as properties cannot legally operate. 

**KEY DISTINCTION from Approach E:** This approach specifically targets **on-market listings** (seller already motivated to sell), whereas Approach E targets off-market opportunities (requires owner outreach).

With £200k capital, can buy distressed HMOs, renew licenses cheaply (£1k-£3k), and convert/hold for rental income or sell at market value, achieving £2M profit through volume and yield.

## **Strengths**
- Strong motivation (cannot operate without renewal)
- **On-market listings ensure immediate availability** (faster execution)
- Low capital for distressed assets
- Transport proximity supports HMO demand
- Clear seller intent (already listed = want to sell)

## **Limitations**
- Limited to HMO-specific properties
- May require compliance work before operation
- Geographic restrictions in Article 4 areas
- Competition from other HMO operators
- On-market = may face bidding competition

## **Implementation Strategy**
1. Filter for expired HMO licenses and review 15-40 active listings
2. Approach owners with renewal offers or direct purchase proposals
3. Acquire distressed HMOs within £180k budget
4. Renew licenses and perform basic improvements with £20k
5. Convert to optimized HMO or hold for 5-8% yield, exiting for £2M profit
6. Scale by targeting multiple licenses in parallel

## **Capital Breakdown**
- Acquisition: £180,000
- License renewal/conversion: £20,000
- **Total:** £200,000

## **Next Steps**

**Proceed to Stage 4: Refinement & Validation**

## SUMMARY & STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Quick Reference Matrix

| Approach | Status | Capital | Timeline | Profit/Deal | # Deals | Best For |
|----------|--------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **A: Precedent Replication** | ✅ | £60k-£120k | 18-24m | £700k-£1.1M | 2-3 | Planning expertise |
| **B: Liquidation Arbitrage** | ✅ | £130k-£200k | 6-12m | £100k-£450k | 4-5 | Cash buyers, speed |
| **C: Airspace Rights** | ⚠️ | £130k-£200k | 12-18m | £450k-£850k | 2-3 | Structural expertise |
| **D: Legacy Holdings** | ✅ | £80k-£160k | 24-60m | £1.1M-£2.6M | 1-2 | Patient capital |
| **E: HMO License Expiry** | ✅ | £160k-£200k | 6-12m | £68k-£113k | 18-30 | Volume strategy |
| **Gemini-B: Airspace (Zero Leases)** | ⚠️ | £195k | 12-18m | £450k-£850k | 2-3 | Clean structures |
| **Codex-B: C3→HMO Conversion** | ✅ | £150k | 6-12m | £80k-£150k | 13-25 | Conversion expertise |
| **Grok-C: HMO (On-Market)** | ✅ | £200k | 6-12m | £68k-£113k | 18-30 | Fast execution |

### Strategic Recommendations by Goal

**🎯 FASTEST RESULTS (6-12 months):**
→ **Approach B (Liquidation)** - Strongest motivation, forced sellers  
→ **Grok-C (HMO On-Market)** - Immediate availability, already listed

**💰 HIGHEST PROFIT PER DEAL:**
→ **Approach A (Precedent)** - £700k-£1.1M per deal  
→ **Approach D (Legacy Holdings)** - £1.1M-£2.6M but 2-5 year timeline

**🛡️ LOWEST RISK:**
→ **Approach A (Precedent)** - Planning precedent reduces uncertainty  
→ **Codex-B (C3→HMO)** - Clear conversion model, proven demand

**⚡ CAPITAL EFFICIENCY:**
→ **Approach D (Legacy Holdings)** - £80k-£160k for £1.1M-£2.6M returns  
→ **Approach A (Precedent)** - £60k-£120k via options

**🎲 BEST DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY:**
Run **Approaches A + B in parallel**:
- **A (Precedent)** = Long-term, high profit (18-24 months)
- **B (Liquidation)** = Short-term, cash flow (6-12 months)
- Balances risk and timeline, different motivation drivers

### Final Recommendation

**PRIMARY STRATEGY:** Test **Approach A (Precedent Replication)** first - strongest convergence across 4 LLMs, proven planning precedent, capital-efficient via options.

**SECONDARY STRATEGY:** Test **Approach B (Liquidation)** in parallel - fastest execution, strongest motivation signal, portfolio diversification.

**IF STRUCTURAL EXPERTISE AVAILABLE:** Test **Gemini-B (Airspace - Zero Leaseholds)** - cleanest airspace strategy with critical leasehold filter.

All approaches are empirically testable in SearchLand AI. Recommend running filters, analyzing result counts, and adapting thresholds based on actual market data.
