## Key Improvements Summary

### Executability (Codex's Main Concern)
**Before (v2.0):** Pattern 4 had vague indicators like "appropriate size"
**After (v2.1):** Pattern 4 has concrete filters like "Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1 AND less than 0.5"

**Impact:** Moves Codex's grade from B- to A- by addressing execution gaps

### Strategic Clarity (Grok's Insight)
**Before (v2.0):** Pattern 13 presented as "relocated workflow"
**After (v2.1):** Pattern 13 presented as "HIGHEST ROI strategy - force multiplier"

**Impact:** Elevates Pattern 13 from technical categorization to strategic prominence

### Pattern Coverage (Multi-Reviewer Consensus)
**Before (v2.0):** 21 patterns (13 original + 8 from Stage 1)
**After (v2.1):** 23 patterns (+ HMO Conversion + Unbroken Freehold)

**Impact:** Adds patterns that 2+ reviewers independently identified as missing
