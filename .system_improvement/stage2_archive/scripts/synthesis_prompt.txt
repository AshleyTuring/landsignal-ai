# SYNTHESIS TASK: Integrate Peer Reviews into FILTER_PATTERNS.md

You are Claude, the original author of FILTER_PATTERNS.md. You've received peer reviews from THREE reviewers: Gemini, Codex, and Grok.

## YOUR TASK

Synthesize their feedback and create an IMPROVED version of FILTER_PATTERNS.md.

### Decision-Making Process:

**For Critiques of Existing Patterns:**
1. If ALL THREE reviewers agree on an improvement → Implement it (strong consensus)
2. If TWO reviewers agree and one is neutral → Implement it (majority consensus)
3. If TWO reviewers agree and one disagrees → Use your judgment based on evidence
4. If ONE suggests improvement and others are neutral → Implement if logical
5. If all THREE DISAGREE → Check iteration results, use your judgment, explain decision

**For New Pattern Suggestions:**
1. If TWO+ reviewers suggest similar pattern → Definitely add it
2. If ONE suggests and it's strong → Add it
3. If pattern overlaps with existing → Merge or explain why separate

**For Structure Changes:**
1. Prioritize changes that help ALL agents
2. Add navigational aids (tags, decision trees, round guides)
3. Keep what works, improve what doesn't

### Output Format:

```markdown
# FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.0 (Post-Peer Review)

[Updated version of FILTER_PATTERNS.md incorporating all accepted feedback]
```

AND separately:

```markdown
# IMPROVEMENT_DECISIONS.md

### Critical Rules:

1. **Be Honest About Trade-offs**
   - If simplifying for Gemini complicates for Codex, acknowledge it
   - Document why you chose one approach over another

2. **Maintain Pattern Quality**
   - Don't add patterns just to please reviewers
   - Ensure new patterns are truly reusable (not one-off)
   - Keep strategic rationale clear

3. **Improve Usability for ALL**
   - If Gemini wants tags and Codex wants decision trees → Add both
   - If one wants more detail and other wants brevity → Use collapsible sections
   - Optimize for collaborative workflow (all agents use same doc)

4. **Update Cross-References**
   - If patterns change, update PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md links
   - Update Requirements template if pattern organization changes
   - Update orchestrate_collaborative.sh if round guidance added

5. **Version Control**
   - Clearly mark as v2.0
   - Keep changelog of what changed
   - Note in header: "Post-Peer Review (Gemini & Codex)"

# FILTER_PATTERNS.md REVIEW - Gemini

**Reviewer:** Gemini  
**Date:** 2025-11-20  
**Review Completeness:** 5/5 parts completed

---

## PART 1: CRITIQUE OF EXISTING PATTERNS

**Overall Observation:** The document is incredibly comprehensive, especially with the v2.0 additions. It has evolved from a simple list into a strategic playbook. My critique focuses on refining this excellent foundation. The original 13 patterns have been expanded to 21, with Pattern 13 being moved to a workflow. I will review the patterns as numbered in the document.

---

### **Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- A classic, fundamental strategy. Clearly identifies low-hanging fruit where initial planning work has been done.

**Weaknesses:**
- The indicators are good proxies but don't definitively confirm a permission has lapsed. The lack of a direct "status: expired" filter in SearchLand is a key constraint that should be highlighted more explicitly here.
- It misses the nuance of *why* it stalled. Was it funding? A planning refusal on a technicality? The pattern could guide the user to investigate this.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a "Next Step" or "Investigation" point: "After identifying a target, research the planning history on the local authority portal to diagnose the reason for the stall. This will inform your offer and strategy."
- Explicitly state the SearchLand limitation: "Note: SearchLand has no 'Expired' status. This pattern uses proxies to find likely candidates."

**Your Usage:** Yes, absolutely. This is a bread-and-butter strategy for finding de-risked opportunities.

---

### **Pattern 2: Motivated Seller Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Excellent breakdown of different motivation angles (corporate, time on market, dereliction).
- The inclusion of Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration) is a masterstroke – this is one of the strongest motivation signals available.

**Weaknesses:**
- Pattern 2B (Long Market Listing) correctly notes that "time on market" isn't a direct filter. This is a significant weakness and relies on manual analysis.
- It could benefit from including "No latest sold date" as another powerful indicator of a potentially motivated, non-professional seller (as seen in Pattern 14).

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Merge or cross-reference Pattern 14A (Inherited & Untouched) here, as "No latest sold date" is a primary indicator of a specific type of motivated seller.
- For Pattern 2B, suggest a workflow: "Export all on-market listings matching basic criteria, then re-run the search weekly. A script can `diff` the lists to identify properties that have been on the market for extended periods."

**Your Usage:** Yes. Finding motivation is the core of off-market sourcing. These patterns are essential.

---

### **Pattern 3: Development Opportunity Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Good job identifying the classic "under-developed" angles: low density in high-value areas.
- Pattern 3A's use of PTAL is a great example of a data-driven approach.

**Weaknesses:**
- Can be a bit generic. "Upside potential" is subjective. The indicators help but it's less precise than a regulation-driven pattern.
- These sites are often highly competed for, so the pattern should mention the need for speed or a creative angle to win the deal.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a "Competitive Edge" section: "To win these deals, you need to act fast, offer creative terms (e.g., overages), or have a unique design/planning solution that unlocks more value than competitors."
- Cross-reference with Pattern 5 (High-Density) and Pattern 6 (Airspace) as common ways to realise the "upside potential".

**Your Usage:** Yes, as a starting point for broad analysis, but I would quickly layer more specific patterns on top.

---

### **Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Realistically addresses the most common constraint for developers.
- The distinction between direct purchase (4A) and control via options (4B) is crucial.
- Pattern 4C (Derelict Asset) correctly identifies that distress can lead to lower entry costs.

**Weaknesses:**
- The capital figures (£10k-£50k for an option) are helpful but market-dependent. This could be noted.
- It could include "Airspace Rights Purchase" as another low-capital entry method, as the initial outlay is for rights, not the whole building.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a note: "Capital for options is highly variable based on site value and seller motivation. The figures provided are illustrative."
- Cross-reference Pattern 6 (Airspace) and Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement Promotion) as other key low-capital strategies.

**Your Usage:** Yes. Essential for any user without institutional-level funding.

---

### **Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Correctly links density to transport accessibility (PTAL) and policy (allocations).
- Provides clear, actionable indicators (e.g., low-rise in a tall building zone).

**Weaknesses:**
- "Local policy: (manual research: tall building zones)" is a key dependency. The pattern should be more upfront that this isn't a simple filtering exercise and requires external research.
- Risk level is high, but it doesn't detail *why*. (e.g., construction risk, planning risk for height, local opposition).

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Elevate the manual research requirement: "CRITICAL: This pattern requires manual research of the Local Plan to identify areas designated for tall buildings or intensification."
- Detail the risks: "High risk due to: 1) Planning challenges from residents, 2) Higher construction costs & complexity, 3) Need for specialist design teams."

**Your Usage:** Yes, for projects specifically targeting high-density outcomes.

---

### **Pattern 6: Airspace Development Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Clear  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- A fantastic, modern strategy that creates value from "thin air".
- The "Flat Roof" filter is a simple but powerful indicator.

**Weaknesses:**
- It significantly understates the complexity of freeholder/leaseholder negotiations and structural assessments. These are the primary hurdles.
- It doesn't mention the potential for Permitted Development rights for upward extensions (e.g., Class AA), which is a major driver for this strategy.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a "Primary Hurdles" section: "1. **Legal:** Securing rights from the freeholder and satisfying existing leaseholders. 2. **Structural:** Commissioning a full structural survey to confirm the existing building can take the load."
- Add a PDR link: "Check for Permitted Development rights (e.g., Class AA - upward extensions) which can de-risk the planning process significantly."

**Your Usage:** Yes, a personal favourite. High-margin and intellectually stimulating.

---

### **Pattern 7: Permitted Development (PDR) Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Excellent, comprehensive breakdown of the key PDR classes sourced directly from presets.
- The inclusion of source presets is invaluable for reverse-engineering the logic.
- The profit calculation logic for Class MA is a brilliant insight.

**Weaknesses:**
- PDR rules change. The document should have a disclaimer to always check the latest government legislation.
- It could be slightly better organised by grouping similar PDRs (e.g., commercial to resi).

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a prominent disclaimer: "⚠️ **Warning:** Permitted Development rights are subject to frequent change. Always verify the current legislation on the official UK government planning portal before proceeding."
- Group the sub-patterns: e.g., "Commercial to Residential (MA, G)", "Agricultural to Residential (Q)", "Infill & Extension (D)".

**Your Usage:** Yes, 100%. PDR is a cornerstone of agile development. This is one of the most valuable sections.

---

### **Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** **Extremely Useful**  

**Strengths:**
- This is the single most powerful category in the document. It turns regulatory burdens into predictable motivation.
- The logic for each sub-pattern (HMO expiry, Lease expiry, EPC compliance) is flawless and creates time-sensitive, actionable leads.
- Sourcing from multiple presets demonstrates the robustness of these strategies.

**Weaknesses:**
- None to speak of. This is an exemplary section.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- This is so important it could be elevated. Perhaps add a "Time-Sensitive Opportunities" callout box at the top of the document that links directly here.
- For EPC, mention the upcoming 2027/2028 deadlines for commercial properties as another future motivation driver.

**Your Usage:** This would be my primary tool for generating high-quality, off-market leads.

---

### **Pattern 9: Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Brilliantly demystifies Green Belt development by focusing on the "Grey Belt" exception.
- The use of "Hardstanding percentage" as a proxy for "previously developed land" is a key, non-obvious insight from the presets.
- Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement) is a classic, effective land promotion strategy.

**Weaknesses:**
- The term "Grey Belt" is industry jargon and might not be universally understood. A brief definition would help.
- It correctly states planning is still needed, but it should emphasise that Green Belt planning is still inherently more political and challenging, even with these exceptions.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a definition: "Grey Belt: A colloquial term for previously developed land (PDL) within the Green Belt, which may be exempt from the strictest protections."
- Add a risk factor: "Expect heightened scrutiny from the Local Planning Authority and potential for local opposition. A strong planning statement justifying the exception is critical."

**Your Usage:** Yes. Understanding these nuances is key to unlocking value where others see only constraints.

---

### **Pattern 10: Renewable Energy Opportunities**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful (Niche)  

**Strengths:**
- An incredibly detailed and well-researched section covering a complex, capital-intensive sector.
- The critical link between project type, land grade (Ag Grade 3b/4), and substation proximity/rating is perfectly explained.
- The SIC code targeting for industrial rooftops is a very advanced and effective technique.

**Weaknesses:**
- This is a very specialist area. It's highly useful for energy developers but may be less relevant for the average property developer.
- The capital requirements are institutional. This should be made very clear.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a "Target Audience" note: "Primarily for specialist energy developers, institutional funds, or landowners looking to lease their land."
- For BESS/Hydrogen/Wind, add a note on the importance of securing a grid connection agreement, which is often the biggest hurdle.

**Your Usage:** I would use this if working for an energy fund or advising a landowner, but not for typical residential/commercial development.

---

### **Pattern 12: Commercial Traffic-Dependent**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Excellent use of data (footfall, vehicle counts) to de-risk commercial development.
- The specific, quantified thresholds (e.g., 800+ footfall for a cafe, 10,000+ vehicles for a drive-thru) are immensely valuable.
- The inclusion of niche markets like Padel and Care Homes shows deep, current market knowledge.

**Weaknesses:**
- The data is powerful but can be expensive to acquire outside of a platform like SearchLand. This dependency could be mentioned.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a note on data source: "The effectiveness of this pattern relies on access to quantified footfall and vehicle count data, as provided by SearchLand."

**Your Usage:** Yes. For any retail or roadside project, this data-driven approach is far superior to guesswork.

---

### **Patterns 14-21 (New from Peer Review)**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- These new patterns are fantastic and fill genuine gaps. They are sourced directly from presets and add significant depth.
- **#14 (Legacy Holdings):** "No latest sold date" is a brilliant motivation signal.
- **#16 (Brownfield Demolition):** The `Hardstanding >30%` + `Developed <10%` combo is a clever way to find ready-to-build brownfield sites.
- **#17 (Micro-Infill):** A great low-capital, high-volume strategy.
- **#18 (Nutrient Neutrality):** A very sophisticated, niche strategy that solves a major problem for housebuilders in specific areas.
- **#19 (Digital Infrastructure):** Taps into the massive demand for data centres.
- **#20 (Brand Covenant Reposition):** A professional, high-finance strategy targeting specific brands.
- **#21 (Community Asset):** A great angle for JVs and social value projects.

**Weaknesses:**
- No significant weaknesses. These are all excellent additions that show a deep analysis of the presets.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Integrate these more tightly into the main body. For example, Pattern 14 is a type of Motivated Seller (Pattern 2). Pattern 17 is a type of Low Capital Entry (Pattern 4). Cross-referencing would be beneficial.

**Your Usage:** Absolutely. These advanced patterns are what separate an expert analyst from a novice.

---

## PART 2: NEW PATTERNS PROPOSED

The existing list is incredibly thorough, but by analysing the 86 presets, I've identified a few distinct strategic gaps.

---

### **NEW PATTERN: HMO Conversion Pipeline**

**Category:** Regulation-Driven / Development Opportunity

**Strategic Rationale:**
While Pattern 8A targets *expiring* HMOs, there is a clear strategy for *creating* new ones. This pattern identifies suitable C3 properties for conversion into HMOs, targeting areas where this is permitted and profitable. It's the "origination" counterpart to the "problem-solving" of expiring licenses.

**Key Filters:**
1. `Use class`: is equal to `C3 dwellinghouses`
2. `NOT Article 4 directions`: Yes (to ensure conversion is possible)
3. `Latest EPC number of habitable rooms`: is greater than 5 (potential for multiple rooms)
4. `Distance to nearest Train Station (m)`: is less than 1000 (attractive to tenants)
5. `Distance to nearest University/Hospital (m)`: is less than 1500 (optional, for tenant demand)
6. `NOT has an HMO`: Yes (ensures it's a conversion opportunity)

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #19 (Homes to HMO)
- Preset #47 (HMO opportunities)
- General property knowledge (HMO creation is a major strategy)

**Use Cases:**
- Building a portfolio of high-yield rental assets.
- Forcing appreciation in value through change of use and refurbishment.

**Expected Results:**
- A list of standard residential houses suitable for conversion, located in areas with strong tenant demand and permissive planning.

---

### **NEW PATTERN: Unbroken Freehold Breakup**

**Category:** Low Capital Entry / Asset Repositioning

**Strategic Rationale:**
This pattern targets entire blocks of flats owned under a single freehold title with no leases sold off. The strategy is to buy the entire block, then either a) sell off the individual flats on new long leases, or b) refurbish the block and increase rents, refinancing based on the higher income. It creates value by breaking up a single, less liquid asset into multiple, more liquid ones.

**Key Filters:**
1. `Tenure`: is equal to `Freehold`
2. `Number of addresses`: is between 3 and 20
3. `Number of leaseholds on the freehold`: is equal to 0
4. `Ownership type`: is equal to `Private owner` (often tired landlords)
5. `Use class`: is equal to `C3 dwellinghouses`

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #1 (Unbroken freeholds)
- Preset #25 (Airspace: Unbroken freeholds)

**Use Cases:**
- Creating "deal flow" by manufacturing multiple assets from one purchase.
- A form of arbitrage, as the sum of the parts (individual flats) is often worth more than the whole (the block).

**Expected Results:**
- A small number of high-potential, multi-unit blocks owned by a single entity, ripe for repositioning.

---

### **NEW PATTERN: Infrastructure-Led Value Uplift**

**Category:** Strategic Land / Time Arbitrage

**Strategic Rationale:**
This pattern identifies undeveloped land directly adjacent to major transport infrastructure (motorways, A-roads). The rationale is that this land is prime for future commercial, logistics, or roadside service development, even if it's not currently zoned for it. It's a long-term play on the principle that "access is everything".

**Key Filters:**
1. `Title area (acres)`: is greater than 1
2. `Developed area percentage`: is less than 5%
3. `Distance to nearest motorway (m)`: is less than 100 OR `Distance to nearest A road (m)`: is less than 100
4. `NOT`: Green Belt, AONB, SSSI (or other major constraints)
5. `Applications in the last 5 years`: is less than 1 (owner is passive)

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #79 (Sites within 50m of major roads)
- General property knowledge (logistics and roadside retail are booming)

**Use Cases:**
- Assembling land for a future logistics park or industrial estate.
- Securing a site for a future petrol station, EV charging hub, or drive-thru.
- A long-term land banking strategy.

**Expected Results:**
- Parcels of undeveloped land with excellent strategic road access, owned by passive landlords, suitable for future promotion or development.

---

## PART 3: STRUCTURE & USABILITY

The current structure is good, with the Matrix and Round Guide being strong additions. However, it's becoming a very long document that is hard to navigate quickly.

---

### **Structural Improvement: Tagging & Filtering System**

**Current Problem:**
When an agent needs to find a pattern for a specific situation (e.g., "I have low capital and need a regulatory angle"), they have to read through the entire document or rely on the Matrix, which is still quite high-level. It's not easily scannable.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add a set of standardized tags to the heading of every single pattern (including sub-patterns).

**Example:**

**Before:**
`### Pattern 8A: HMO Expired Licenses`

**After:**
`### Pattern 8A: HMO Expired Licenses`
`#RegulationDriven #Motivation #LowCapital #TimeSensitive`

**Proposed Tags:**
- **Constraint:** `#LowCapital`, `#MediumCapital`, `#HighCapital`, `#Institutional`
- **Strategy:** `#PDR`, `#Motivation`, `#RegulationDriven`, `#Airspace`, `#GreenBelt`, `#StrategicLand`, `#Renewables`, `#CommercialData`
- **Risk:** `#LowRisk`, `#MediumRisk`, `#HighRisk`
- **Timeline:** `#ShortTerm` (0-12m), `#MediumTerm` (12-24m), `#LongTerm` (24m+)
- **Attribute:** `#TimeSensitive`, `#Niche`, `#DataDriven`

**Benefit:**
This allows an LLM (or human) to perform a quick `Ctrl+F` search for a tag like `#LowCapital` and instantly jump to all relevant patterns. It makes the document searchable and turns it into a true database.

---

### **Structural Improvement: Actionable Filter Snippets**

**Current Problem:**
The patterns describe the *indicators* and *logic*, but they don't provide a ready-to-use filter set that an agent can copy and paste. The agent still has to translate the logic into the correct SearchLand syntax, referencing `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add a collapsible "Example Filter Snippet" to each sub-pattern, using the exact syntax from `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`.

**Example:**

**Under `Pattern 8A: HMO Expired Licenses`:**

<details>
<summary>📋 Click for Example Filter Snippet</summary>

```
// Approach: Expired HMO Licenses
// Source: FILTER_PATTERNS.md - Pattern 8A
{
  "group": "Expired HMOs",
  "logic": "AND",
  "filters": [
    { "name": "Tenure", "operator": "is equal to", "value": "Freehold" },
    { "name": "Has an HMO", "operator": "is equal to", "value": "Yes" },
    { "name": "HMO License Expiry Date", "operator": "is before", "value": "[CURRENT_DATE]" }
  ]
}
```
</details>

**Benefit:**
- Drastically reduces implementation time and errors.
- Makes the patterns immediately actionable.
- Bridges the gap between strategic intent (this file) and technical execution (`LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`).

---

## PART 4: PATTERN RANKING

This ranking prioritises patterns based on a combination of actionability, potential ROI, and the strength of the inefficiency they exploit.

| Rank | Pattern # | Pattern Name | Why This Ranking? |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 8 | Regulation-Driven | **Highest ROI.** Creates predictable, time-sensitive motivation. Exploits legal requirements, which is the strongest possible driver for a seller to act. |
| 2 | 13 | Time/Information Arbitrage | **Highest Skill ROI.** A meta-strategy that multiplies the value of all others. Being first is a massive, monetizable advantage. |
| 3 | 2 | Motivated Seller | **Core of Off-Market.** Directly targets seller psychology. Pattern 2D (Liquidation) is an A-grade strategy on its own. |
| 4 | 7 | Permitted Development (PDR) | **Speed & Certainty.** Bypassing full planning is a huge de-risking factor and accelerates timelines, directly boosting IRR. |
| 5 | 9 | Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds | **Unlocks Hidden Value.** Creates opportunities where others see none. Requires expertise, which creates a barrier to entry and protects margins. |
| 6 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | **Most Accessible.** Directly addresses the primary constraint for most users. Enables participation in deals that would otherwise be out of reach. |
| 7 | 14-21 | The "New" Advanced Patterns | **Expert Level.** These are sophisticated, targeted strategies (Nutrient Neutrality, Data Centres, etc.) that demonstrate deep market knowledge and can yield outsized returns in their niches. |
| 8 | 6 | Airspace Development | **Creative & High-Margin.** A modern, elegant way to create value, but complex legal and structural hurdles place it below more straightforward strategies. |
| 9 | 12 | Commercial Traffic-Dependent | **Data-Driven & De-Risked.** Using footfall/vehicle data is a powerful way to prove viability for commercial projects, reducing tenant risk. |
| 10 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | **Fundamental but Competitive.** A solid, classic strategy, but these sites are often tracked by many, making them more competitive than regulation-driven leads. |
| 11 | 3 | Development Opportunity | **Good but Generic.** A necessary starting point for analysis, but often leads to obvious, highly-competed sites unless combined with other, more nuanced patterns. |
| 12 | 5 | High-Density/Intensification | **High Risk, High Reward.** Capital-intensive and fraught with planning/construction risk. A valid strategy, but less broadly applicable than others. |
| 13 | 10 | Renewable Energy | **Niche & Institutional.** Extremely valuable for its target audience, but too specialist and capital-intensive for the majority of property developers. |

**Real-World Test:**
"If you were given the MixedUse-8Storey-2M project requirements RIGHT NOW, which patterns would you reference and why?"

This is a classic "stacking" problem. I would combine multiple patterns:

1.  **Start with the Goal (Pattern 5 & 3):** I need height and mixed-use.
    *   **Pattern 5 (High-Density):** To find areas where 8 storeys is even feasible. I'd look for `PTAL: 4-6b` or proximity to major stations. I'd also start my manual research on local plans for tall building zones.
    *   **Pattern 3C (Existing Use + Upside):** To find sites that already have a commercial component, reducing the change-of-use planning risk.

2.  **Apply the Constraint (Pattern 4):** I only have £200k capital. Direct purchase is out.
    *   **Pattern 4B (Option Agreement Candidates):** This is my primary tool. I need to find an owner willing to agree to an option while I pursue planning. This means I need a motivated seller.

3.  **Find the Motivation (Pattern 2, 8, 14):** How do I find a motivated seller for my high-density target?
    *   **Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry):** I'd search for a low-rise commercial building in a high-PTAL area with a lease expiring in 6-12 months. The owner faces an income cliff and might be open to an option.
    *   **Pattern 2A/D (Corporate Hold / Liquidation):** A corporate owner, especially one in liquidation, holding an under-utilised 2-3 storey building in a prime location is a perfect target.
    *   **Pattern 14 (Legacy Holdings):** An individual who inherited a small commercial building years ago (`No latest sold date`) in a now-booming area might be unaware of its 8-storey potential and open to a life-changing option deal.

**Final Approach:** My primary search would be a combination: `(Pattern 5A criteria) AND (Pattern 8B criteria)`. Find a low-rise commercial building in a high-PTAL zone with an expiring lease. This is the most likely candidate for a low-capital, high-upside project.

---

## PART 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

The `Collaborative Round Guide` is a brilliant addition. It formalises how to use the patterns. My suggestions focus on making it even more effective.

---

**1. Are patterns mapped well to rounds?**

The mapping is good but could be more comprehensive. For example:
- **Round 4 (Behavioral/Motivation):** Currently lists Patterns 2, 13, 11. It should absolutely include **Pattern 14 (Legacy Holdings)**, **Pattern 15 (Portfolio Divestment)**, and the regulatory patterns from **Pattern 8**, as regulation is a primary driver of behaviour.

**2. Should there be a "Round Guide"?**

Yes, the guide is essential. It should be expanded.

**Proposed Improvement:**
Structure the guide with "Primary" and "Secondary" patterns for each round.

```
## Round 4: Behavioral/Motivation
**Goal:** Exploit seller psychology, market timing, and non-obvious motivations.

**Primary Patterns:**
- **Pattern 2 (Motivated Seller):** The foundational behavioral pattern. Start here.
- **Pattern 8 (Regulation-Driven):** Regulation *causes* predictable behavior. A primary tool.
- **Pattern 14 (Legacy Holdings):** Targets the specific psychology of inherited/long-term owners.

**Secondary Patterns:**
- **Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage):** A workflow to apply to any behavioral signal you find.
- **Pattern 15 (Portfolio Divestment):** A corporate-level behavioral pattern.
```

**3. Missing Round-Specific Guidance?**

Yes. The guide tells you *which* patterns to use, but not *how* to think during that round.

**Proposed Improvement:**
Add "Key Questions for this Round" to the guide, prompted by the patterns.

```
## Round 3: Regulation-Driven - Guidance

**Relevant Patterns:** 7 (PDR), 8 (Regulation-Driven), 18 (Nutrient Neutrality)

**Key Questions for this Round:**
- Which PDR classes (Pattern 7) could bypass planning entirely for this site?
- Are there any upcoming lease expiries (Pattern 8B) on or near the target site?
- Does the site have a poor EPC rating (Pattern 8C) that will force the owner to sell or spend?
- Is this site in a Nutrient Neutrality zone (Pattern 18), creating a problem we can solve?
- Is there an expired HMO license (Pattern 8A) nearby, indicating a tired landlord?
```
This turns the guide from a simple map into a strategic thinking prompt for the agents.

## SUMMARY

**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**
1.  **Make it Actionable:** Add copy-paste "Example Filter Snippets" to every sub-pattern. This is the single most impactful change to improve usability.
2.  **Make it Scannable:** Implement a comprehensive tagging system (`#LowCapital`, `#PDR`, etc.) for every pattern. This allows for rapid searching and filtering.
3.  **Enhance the Workflow Guide:** Improve the `Collaborative Round Guide` by adding "Key Questions" for each round, turning it from a map into a true strategic prompt.

**Confidence in Current Patterns:** **High.** The document is excellent, comprehensive, and well-researched. The strategies are sound and directly sourced from proven presets.

**Would You Use This Document?** **Yes, daily.** With the suggested changes, it would become the central, indispensable playbook for all strategic sourcing activities.

**Overall Grade:** **A-**
An outstanding resource. It loses a few points only on immediate actionability and scannability, both of which are easily fixed with the suggestions above. A truly impressive piece of work by Claude and the other reviewers.

## Combining Patterns

### Example: "Mixed-Use 8-Storey £2M Profit on £200k Capital"

**Possible Approach Combinations:**

1. **Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A) + Motivated Seller (Pattern 2A)**
   - Find stalled mixed-use planning with corporate seller motivation
   - Low acquisition cost, planning precedent exists
   - Capital: option agreement or distressed purchase

2. **Under-Developed (Pattern 3A) + Airspace (Pattern 6A)**
   - High PTAL, flat roof, existing low-rise
   - Add 4-6 storeys of residential above
   - Capital: airspace rights + construction finance

3. **Derelict Turnaround (Pattern 4C) + Height Intensification (Pattern 5A)**
   - Derelict building in tall building zone
   - Demolish + rebuild to 8 storeys
   - Capital: acquisition + phased construction

Strategy: Repurpose under-utilised institutional land for senior living or health hubs
Source: SearchLand Preset #28, #37, #62
Discovered: 2025-11-20 (Peer Review)

Indicators:

- Within 500m of hospital or major bus routes
- Ownership type: Private trust or non-profit (NOT corporate)
- Less than 1 application in last 5 years (optional)

Strategic Rationale:
- Under-utilised institutional land (schools, community halls, care homes)
- Near hospitals and town centres ideal for senior living or health hubs
- Recycling through JV with councils/trustees
- Community asset transfers before marketing

## 13. Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies ⭐ NEW

**Core Concept:** SearchLand refreshes data every 24 hours. Speed advantage = profit advantage.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity

**Analyzing existing patterns and proposing new ones**

There is a lot here! I'm examining pattern 8’s coverage and noticing it only includes a few subpatterns, missing others like Article 4 triggers. I’m also reviewing patterns 9 through 13 for completeness, structural issues, and noting potential gaps. Then, I’m compiling a thoughtful list of 3 to 5 new pattern proposals drawn from specific presets, each with categories, rationales, and use cases, planning to reference exact line numbers from raw preset files to support the recommendations. This feels like building a robust framework for enhanced pattern recognition—all anchored carefully in source data.

# FILTER_PATTERNS.md REVIEW - Codex

**Reviewer:** Codex  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Review Completeness:** 5/5 parts completed

---

## PART 1: CRITIQUE OF EXISTING PATTERNS

## Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides two complementary signals (aged planning history and specific proposal keywords), which are supported by SearchLand fields, so the basic idea can be executed quickly (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No preset references or example filters, so an analyst still has to rediscover the “Max dwellings applied for” and “Decision date” combinations that already exist in presets such as Large Sites with Planning (#63) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:718`).  
- Missing guidance on how to triage outcomes (approved vs. refused vs. withdrawn), which means many surfaced sites may still be live schemes and not truly “stalled.”

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add a ready-to-use baseline filter (e.g., “Last application before 2022 AND Decision=Approved” plus “Applications last 5 years ≤2”) and link directly to preset IDs.  
- Add troubleshooting tips such as using “Application Status: Unknown” to catch schemes that never progressed, and advise on layering ownership motivation signals.

**Your Usage:** Yes, but I would build my own preset that removes live schemes and surfaces title owners immediately.

---

## Pattern 2: Motivated Seller

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Combines varied motivation angles (corporate derelicts, pricing caps, proximity to transport) so it naturally feeds Round 4 behavioural thinking (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:58-99`).  
- The liquidation sub-pattern introduces a measurable legal trigger with sample filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:176-224`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Pattern B depends on a “time on market” metric that SearchLand does not expose, so the workflow cannot actually be executed as written (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:74-85`).  
- Transport adjacency is not a motivation signal by itself; without adding distress proxies (price change, EPC, tenure) it just repeats development logic (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:87-98`).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Replace “long listing” with actual filters (e.g., “Sales listing price reduced ≥2 times” or “Latest sold date before 2008 AND currently on market”).  
- Surface corporate portfolio stress by referencing preset #35 (companies owning 30+ titles with HMOs) as an explicit bulk divestment trigger (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:401`).

**Your Usage:** Yes, but only after reworking the selection logic to rely on verifiable filters.

---

## Pattern 3: Development Opportunity

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights three distinct density plays (high PTAL gaps, low plot cover, mixed-use upside) which match typical feasibility studies (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:228-270`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No references to the presets that already implement these criteria (e.g., “Unconstrained up to 5 units” #3 or “1–2 acre land” #5), so the analyst has to rebuild each one manually (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:228-270`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:31`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:60`).  
- Missing screening advice for conservation constraints or land ownership, so you risk lots of dead-end titles.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add explicit numeric thresholds pulled from the presets (e.g., “Developed area ≤2%” from preset #3) and link to example exports.  
- Include a “next filter” checklist (ownership, SHLAA status, flood risk) so divergent ideas don’t repeatedly hit the same blockers.

**Your Usage:** Only after augmenting with preset links and constraint filters; right now it’s too high level.

---

## Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Limited Use  

**Strengths:**  
- Recognises option agreements as a capital-light way to control higher-value land, which aligns with most small-developer playbooks (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:290-302`).  
- Calls out derelict turnaround as a way to get pricing leverage (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:304-315`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Pattern A just says “price <£200k” without acknowledging that this needs to be paired with viable site attributes; the preset source (Run Down Homes #2) isn’t named (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:276-288`).  
- Option candidates reference “latest sold date” but ignore the far better “No latest sold date” / “Number of titles held” signals that already exist, so the shortlist will still include professional vendors (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:290-302`).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Anchor each sub-pattern to the relevant preset (e.g., Run Down Homes #2, Older Houses with Space #69) and add expected hit-rates so we know whether sub-£200k deals exist in the target geography (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:18`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:803`).  
- Provide an outreach script or deal structure example to make the option approach actionable.

**Your Usage:** Only Pattern C is worth running today; I’d ignore the rest until clearer filters and performance data are provided.

---

## Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Explicitly ties PTAL/tall building policies to intensification, which mirrors how London boroughs assess uplift (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:322-348`).  
- Recognises the need to use allocation data (SHLAA / site allocation field) for Pattern C.

**Weaknesses:**  
- PTAL is London-only, yet there is no alternate accessibility proxy for the rest of the UK, limiting applicability (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:324-335`).  
- No tactics for handling community opposition or daylight/overshadowing assessments, despite those being the main blockers for 8+ storey schemes.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add national equivalents (e.g., “Distance to railway <400m” or “In adopted settlement=Yes”) to keep the pattern usable outside London.  
- Include examples of how to combine this with Pattern 1 (recycling partially implemented permissions) for the MixedUse brief.

**Your Usage:** Yes, but I would immediately add non-PTAL accessibility filters and political context (tall building zones, housing delivery test data).

---

## Pattern 6: Airspace Development

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Focuses on measurable roof characteristics (flat roof flag, max height) and hints at PTAL overlays, making it easy to build filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:368-394`).  
- Highlights the importance of transport adjacency to support sales values.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores title complexity (leaseholds, right-to-light covenants). Presets #22-25 already exclude buildings with multiple leaseholders, but that guidance is missing (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:218`).  
- No mention of structural surveys or party wall risk management even though those drive the capex timeline.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Reference presets #22-25 explicitly and advise filtering to “Less than 1 leasehold” to keep deals controllable.  
- Include a checklist for freeholder consent/Section 5 notices so analysts don’t chase non-executable sites.

**Your Usage:** Yes—with the leasehold filter bolted on this remains one of the fastest win patterns.

---

## Pattern 7: Permitted Development Rights

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides detailed indicator lists plus preset references for MA, Q, G, and Infill, including regulatory thresholds and excluded designations (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:400-522`).  
- Notes SearchLand’s pre-calculated profitability for Class MA, which is extremely helpful.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Omits Class AA rooftop extensions and Class ZA demolish-and-rebuild plays even though SearchLand has preset #33 for ZA (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:400-522`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:378`).  
- Doesn’t address Article 4 direction coverage or prior approval timing, so analysts may inadvertently shortlist sites where PDRs are withdrawn.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add Class ZA guidance plus a warning on structural surveys for rooftop Class AA schemes.  
- Insert a “PDR eligibility” pre-check (Article 4, conservation area, size limits) with cross-reference to the Available Filters list.

**Your Usage:** Yes—PD routes are a staple, but I would immediately add Class ZA and Class AA coverage.

---

## Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- HMO licence expiry logic is well articulated with motivation timelines and filter sequences (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:523-591`).  
- Lease expiry pattern introduces precise time windows (6–24 months) tied to preset IDs such as #17 and #46.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Article 4 directions and EPC enforcement nuances are not explained, so analysts might breach local HMO caps or underestimate retrofit costs (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:592-676`).  
- Lease expiry opportunities really belong under Pattern 2 because the driver is behavioural, not regulatory—mixing them here dilutes the category purpose.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add an Article 4 map reference and MEES (Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard) deadlines per asset class.  
- Split lease expiry into Motivated Seller with a “regulation pressure” flag, keeping this section focused on true compliance triggers (licensing, EPC, enforcement).

**Your Usage:** Yes—the HMO and EPC plays are dependable, but I would mentally relocate lease expiries into my behavioural workflow.

---

## Pattern 9: Green Belt / Constraint Workarounds

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides specific thresholds for Grey Belt acreage, hardstanding %, and proximity to built-up areas, plus preset references (#7, #44) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-799`).  
- Edge-of-settlement promotion includes a six-step process and SHLAA guidance, which is rare in the other patterns.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Strategic Land sub-patterns (Emerging Allocations and Strategic Employment) live inside this section but are labelled as “Pattern 11” mergers, creating numbering confusion (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:805-905`).  
- No acknowledgement of nutrient neutrality or biodiversity net gain obligations even though these are acute in Green Belt-edge projects.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Break Strategic Land back out as Pattern 11 with its own header to avoid cross-referencing chaos.  
- Add a planning obligations checklist (BNG units, nutrient credits) so analysts budget for the real acceptance criteria.

**Your Usage:** Yes—Grey Belt and settlement edge filters are my primary rural sourcing method.

---

## Pattern 10: Renewable Energy

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Covers all major renewable asset classes (ground-mount solar, rooftop solar, BESS, hydrogen, wind) with concrete substation distance requirements and SIC code targeting (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:908-1048`).  
- Provides capital requirement guidance, which helps triage whether a developer should pursue or partner.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Treats fundamentally different business models (long-term infrastructure vs. opportunistic flips) as a single pattern, which overwhelms users looking for quick wins.  
- Omits grid-queue lead times and land agreement structures (lease vs. option), which are decisive factors in renewable deals.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Split into two patterns: “Utility-scale land plays” and “Industrial rooftop PPAs” with separate workflows and skill requirements.  
- Include a reminder to check NGESO queue status and DNO capacity maps before chasing titles.

**Your Usage:** Selectively—only rooftop solar (Pattern B) fits my capital stack; I would skip utility-scale unless I had an institutional partner.

---

## Pattern 11: Strategic Land (currently embedded in Pattern 9)

**Clarity:** Unclear (missing header)  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Emerging allocation play gives a step-by-step process and precise filters (housing allocation emerging + zero applications) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:805-855`).  
- Strategic employment land sub-pattern outlines acreage, allocation type, and road proximity requirements (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:866-904`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Lack of an actual “## 11” heading means the category is invisible from the table of contents, and the Master Matrix points to Pattern 11 even though readers can’t find it (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:9-25`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:102-126`).  
- No discussion on promotion agreements, planning costs, or long timelines (3–5 years) which are critical to strategic land decisions.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Restore Pattern 11 as a standalone section with sub-patterns for allocations and employment land, and summarise option vs. promotion contract structures.  
- Include expected timelines, likely capex for planning, and exit routes (e.g., sell to national housebuilder).

**Your Usage:** Yes—strategic promotions are bread and butter, but the document needs clearer signposting and cost guidance.

---

## Pattern 12: Commercial Traffic-Dependent

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Uses quantifiable metrics (footfall counts, vehicle counts, lease end dates) and references presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72 (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1136-1249`).  
- Includes threshold cheat sheets (e.g., 800 vs. 6,000 footfall) which is exactly the type of quick decision aid missing elsewhere.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Bundles three very different sub-patterns (prime retail, drive-thru, niche markets), making it hard to know which preset to run in which round.  
- Lacks commentary on data coverage (footfall/vehicle counts are sparse outside major centres) and how to supplement them with local knowledge.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Split Pattern C into separate write-ups for padel vs. care homes; they need different datasets and outlets.  
- Add a data quality warning and suggested backup filters (e.g., “Within 200m of motorway” when vehicle counts don’t exist).

**Your Usage:** Occasionally—mainly for drive-thru/EV combos where traffic counters exist; I’d rarely use the padel/care-home mix without clearer guidance.

---

## Pattern 13: Time / Information Arbitrage

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Captures the core value proposition (daily exports, diffing results, immediate outreach) and even provides example scripts and deal flow timeline (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1773-1890`).  
- Emphasises capital readiness (option deposits, bridging lines) which is essential to execute these plays.

**Weaknesses:**  
- No practical instructions on how to automate the exports (API endpoints, CSV structure) or how to store comparisons, so non-technical agents can’t stand it up quickly.  
- Lacks SLA guidance for contacting owners (e.g., how to find contact details within hours), and doesn’t link to supporting SOPs.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add a short “tooling” appendix with a Python diff script outline and recommended alert thresholds.  
- Include a contact acquisition workflow (e.g., Land Registry download, company director lookup) so the “call same day” directive is achievable.

**Your Usage:** Absolutely—this is the highest-ROCE workflow when combined with Patterns 1, 2, or 8.

---

## PART 2: NEW PATTERNS PROPOSED

### NEW PATTERN: Unbroken Freehold Break-Up

**Category:** Low Capital Entry / Motivated Seller  
**Strategic Rationale:** Acquiring multi-address freeholds with zero leaseholds allows you to split titles or sell flats individually, extracting uplift without heavy construction. Preset #1 already packages the necessary filters (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:7`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Ownership: Freehold, private owner.  
2. Addresses: 3–15 addresses on one title.  
3. Leaseholds: Exactly 0 leaseholds.  
4. Use class: Only C3 dwellings (easy resales).  
**Sourced From:** Preset #1 (Unbroken Freeholds).  
**Use Cases:** Break up into individual leases, add airspace rights, or sell to shared ownership providers.  
**Expected Results:** Typically 20–60 titles per LPA; 10–20% margin uplift from splitting plus potential airspace sale.

---

### NEW PATTERN: Article 4 Escape Hatch HMOs

**Category:** Regulation-Driven  
**Strategic Rationale:** Outside Article 4 areas, Class C3 homes can still be converted to HMOs via permitted development. Preset #19 screens for properties that are not already HMOs and sit outside Article 4 directions, giving a shovel-ready pipeline (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:218`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: C3, exactly one address.  
2. NOT Article 4 directions.  
3. Ownership: Company or private.  
4. Status: NOT already HMO, NOT currently listed.  
**Sourced From:** Preset #19.  
**Use Cases:** Investors needing ready-to-convert stock in secondary towns before MEES/EPC tightening pushes rents up.  
**Expected Results:** 50–150 sites per wider metro; GDV uplift of £150–£250 per monthly room rent after conversion.

---

### NEW PATTERN: Leasehold Sunset Recapture

**Category:** Time / Information Arbitrage  
**Strategic Rationale:** Individual flats with leases expiring before 2099 become almost unmortgageable as the term decays, so landlords are motivated to re-gear or sell at a discount. Preset #78 captures precisely these leases (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:893`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: C3, one address.  
2. Lease end date: within X years (configurable).  
3. Ownership: NOT council.  
**Sourced From:** Preset #78 plus Companies House charges.  
**Use Cases:** Negotiate lease extensions, collect reverse premiums, or assemble blocks for enfranchisement.  
**Expected Results:** 100–200 entries per London borough; 15–25% uplift upon re-gearing and resale.

---

### NEW PATTERN: Class ZA Quick Rebuild

**Category:** Permitted Development (PDR)  
**Strategic Rationale:** Class ZA allows demolition of small commercial buildings (<1,000 sq m, <18m roof) and rebuild as residential, offering a faster route than full planning. Preset #33 already isolates compliant titles (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:378`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: E(g)(i)-(iii).  
2. Building size: <1,000 sq m.  
3. Roof height: <18m.  
4. NOT conservation area / listed / AONB.  
**Sourced From:** Preset #33 plus EPC data for energy upgrades.  
**Use Cases:** Rapidly repurpose obsolete light industrial sheds in commuter towns into 4–10 units without a full committee battle.  
**Expected Results:** 30–80 assets per LPA; 20–30% margin improvement by saving 6–12 months of planning time.

---

## PART 3: STRUCTURE & USABILITY

- The document lists 13 categories at the top but the body now contains 21 numbered patterns and Pattern 11 is hidden inside Pattern 9, creating a navigation mismatch (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:9-25`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-905`). Introduce a canonical index that lists every pattern/sub-pattern with anchors and ensures numbers match.  
- Master Strategy Matrix references pattern numbers 12, 14–21 while skipping 11 entirely, so the quick-look table cannot be trusted (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:102-126`). Rebuild this matrix dynamically (maybe as a CSV) so it always reflects the real pattern list, and include key filters + preset IDs in each row.  
- Round Guide names patterns (“Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly”, “Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion”) that no longer exist, which will only confuse collaborating agents (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:134-149`). Add round-specific mini-lists drawn from actual pattern titles plus tags (#LowCapital #Regulation etc.) to make lookup immediate.  
- For each pattern, add a two-line “Filter Snapshot” (fields + threshold + preset) and a “Common Failure Modes” box so agents can triage results faster.  
- Provide a decision tree or checklist (capital level, timeline, risk appetite) that references tags rather than raw numbers, letting the reader quickly jump to 2–3 relevant patterns.

---

## PART 4: PATTERN RANKING

| Rank | Pattern # | Pattern Name | Why This Ranking? |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 8 | Regulation-Driven | Direct legal deadlines (HMO licences, MEES) create predictable seller behaviour and can be executed with clear filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:523-676`). |
| 2 | 13 | Time/Information Arbitrage | Speed-based workflow consistently produces outsized spreads when layered onto any other pattern (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1773-1890`). |
| 3 | 2 | Motivated Seller | Combines multiple distress signals and liquidation triggers, generating immediate negotiation leverage (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:58-224`). |
| 4 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | Planning groundwork is already done; adding a motivation layer often unlocks sub-market deals (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`). |
| 5 | 3 | Development Opportunity | Bread-and-butter densification logic that underpins most MixedUse briefs when layered with Pattern 5. |
| 6 | 7 | Permitted Development | Clear regulatory pathways (MA/Q/G) accelerate delivery without full planning (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:400-522`). |
| 7 | 5 | High-Density/Intensification | Gives the framework for 6–8 storey infill, especially around high PTAL nodes (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:322-348`). |
| 8 | 6 | Airspace Development | Offers a low-capital path to add units where land is expensive, provided leaseholds are manageable (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:368-394`). |
| 9 | 9 | Green Belt/Constraint | Unlocks cheaper land, though timelines are longer and politics heavier (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-799`). |
| 10 | 10 | Renewable Energy | Attractive margins but usually needs specialist partners and grid expertise (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:908-1048`). |
| 11 | 12 | Commercial Traffic-Dependent | Useful when footfall data exists, but dataset coverage is patchy (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1136-1299`). |
| 12 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | Supply is very limited and the filters are still vague, so hit-rate is low (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:274-316`). |
| 13 | 11 | Strategic Land | Enormous upside but multi-year timelines and hidden costs make it less practical for most briefs (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:805-905`). |

**Real-World Test (MixedUse-8Storey-£2M profit brief):**  
I would start with Pattern 5 (intensification) to locate PTAL 4–6 low-rise plots; overlay Pattern 1 to grab those with stalled mixed-use permissions, then layer Pattern 2 (corporate derelicts) to prioritise motivated sellers. If policy support is weak, I’d check Pattern 6 (airspace on existing mixed-use blocks) to hit the storey count without full demolition.

---

## PART 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

- **Round Mapping:** Current Round Guide references non-existent pattern names and doesn’t show which filters map to each round (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:134-172`). Create a “Round Quick Sheet” where each round lists 3–4 patterns with tags (Capital, Timeline, Category) and links directly to preset IDs.  
- **Round-Specific Prompts:** Provide short playbooks (e.g., “Round 2: If no precedent found, switch to Pattern 7C or Pattern 9A”) so collaborating LLMs don’t spin in circles during divergent ideation.  
- **Monitoring Hooks:** For Pattern 13, publish a shared cron/automation spec so every agent knows how to request daily exports and where the diff outputs live.  
- **Behavioural Round Assets:** Round 4 currently lacks explicit references to Patterns 2 and 14–15 (both behavioural); add a behavioural matrix to highlight which filters show seller psychology cues.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Encourage agents to note outcomes back into LEARNINGS_DATABASE so the “Strengths/Weaknesses” sections evolve beyond static text.

---

## SUMMARY

**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**  
1. Fix navigation and numbering: reintroduce a proper Pattern 11 section and align the Master Matrix/Round Guide with the actual 21 patterns (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:9-149`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-905`).  
2. Add preset-linked filter snapshots + decision aids for every pattern so analysts can execute without rebuilding the logic manually.  
3. Expand regulatory and workflow details (Article 4, MEES, automation scripts) so high-value patterns like 8 and 13 are immediately actionable.

**Confidence in Current Patterns:** Medium – the ideas are solid, but missing execution detail slows adoption.

**Would You Use This Document?** With Changes – I need the structural fixes and filter snapshots before treating it as a go-to playbook.

**Reviewer:** Codex  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Review Completeness:** 5/5 parts completed

## PART 1: CRITIQUE OF EXISTING PATTERNS

## Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides two complementary signals (aged planning history and specific proposal keywords), which are supported by SearchLand fields, so the basic idea can be executed quickly (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No preset references or example filters, so an analyst still has to rediscover the “Max dwellings applied for” and “Decision date” combinations that already exist in presets such as Large Sites with Planning (#63) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:718`).  
- Missing guidance on how to triage outcomes (approved vs. refused vs. withdrawn), which means many surfaced sites may still be live schemes and not truly “stalled.”

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add a ready-to-use baseline filter (e.g., “Last application before 2022 AND Decision=Approved” plus “Applications last 5 years ≤2”) and link directly to preset IDs.  
- Add troubleshooting tips such as using “Application Status: Unknown” to catch schemes that never progressed, and advise on layering ownership motivation signals.

**Your Usage:** Yes, but I would build my own preset that removes live schemes and surfaces title owners immediately.

---

## Pattern 2: Motivated Seller

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Combines varied motivation angles (corporate derelicts, pricing caps, proximity to transport) so it naturally feeds Round 4 behavioural thinking (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:58-99`).  
- The liquidation sub-pattern introduces a measurable legal trigger with sample filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:176-224`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Pattern B depends on a “time on market” metric that SearchLand does not expose, so the workflow cannot actually be executed as written (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:74-85`).  
- Transport adjacency is not a motivation signal by itself; without adding distress proxies (price change, EPC, tenure) it just repeats development logic (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:87-98`).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Replace “long listing” with actual filters (e.g., “Sales listing price reduced ≥2 times” or “Latest sold date before 2008 AND currently on market”).  
- Surface corporate portfolio stress by referencing preset #35 (companies owning 30+ titles with HMOs) as an explicit bulk divestment trigger (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:401`).

**Your Usage:** Yes, but only after reworking the selection logic to rely on verifiable filters.

---

## Pattern 3: Development Opportunity

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights three distinct density plays (high PTAL gaps, low plot cover, mixed-use upside) which match typical feasibility studies (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:228-270`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No references to the presets that already implement these criteria (e.g., “Unconstrained up to 5 units” #3 or “1–2 acre land” #5), so the analyst has to rebuild each one manually (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:228-270`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:31`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:60`).  
- Missing screening advice for conservation constraints or land ownership, so you risk lots of dead-end titles.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add explicit numeric thresholds pulled from the presets (e.g., “Developed area ≤2%” from preset #3) and link to example exports.  
- Include a “next filter” checklist (ownership, SHLAA status, flood risk) so divergent ideas don’t repeatedly hit the same blockers.

**Your Usage:** Only after augmenting with preset links and constraint filters; right now it’s too high level.

---

## Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Limited Use  

**Strengths:**  
- Recognises option agreements as a capital-light way to control higher-value land, which aligns with most small-developer playbooks (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:290-302`).  
- Calls out derelict turnaround as a way to get pricing leverage (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:304-315`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Pattern A just says “price <£200k” without acknowledging that this needs to be paired with viable site attributes; the preset source (Run Down Homes #2) isn’t named (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:276-288`).  
- Option candidates reference “latest sold date” but ignore the far better “No latest sold date” / “Number of titles held” signals that already exist, so the shortlist will still include professional vendors (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:290-302`).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Anchor each sub-pattern to the relevant preset (e.g., Run Down Homes #2, Older Houses with Space #69) and add expected hit-rates so we know whether sub-£200k deals exist in the target geography (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:18`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:803`).  
- Provide an outreach script or deal structure example to make the option approach actionable.

**Your Usage:** Only Pattern C is worth running today; I’d ignore the rest until clearer filters and performance data are provided.

---

## Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Explicitly ties PTAL/tall building policies to intensification, which mirrors how London boroughs assess uplift (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:322-348`).  
- Recognises the need to use allocation data (SHLAA / site allocation field) for Pattern C.

**Weaknesses:**  
- PTAL is London-only, yet there is no alternate accessibility proxy for the rest of the UK, limiting applicability (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:324-335`).  
- No tactics for handling community opposition or daylight/overshadowing assessments, despite those being the main blockers for 8+ storey schemes.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add national equivalents (e.g., “Distance to railway <400m” or “In adopted settlement=Yes”) to keep the pattern usable outside London.  
- Include examples of how to combine this with Pattern 1 (recycling partially implemented permissions) for the MixedUse brief.

**Your Usage:** Yes, but I would immediately add non-PTAL accessibility filters and political context (tall building zones, housing delivery test data).

---

## Pattern 6: Airspace Development

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Focuses on measurable roof characteristics (flat roof flag, max height) and hints at PTAL overlays, making it easy to build filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:368-394`).  
- Highlights the importance of transport adjacency to support sales values.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores title complexity (leaseholds, right-to-light covenants). Presets #22-25 already exclude buildings with multiple leaseholders, but that guidance is missing (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:218`).  
- No mention of structural surveys or party wall risk management even though those drive the capex timeline.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Reference presets #22-25 explicitly and advise filtering to “Less than 1 leasehold” to keep deals controllable.  
- Include a checklist for freeholder consent/Section 5 notices so analysts don’t chase non-executable sites.

**Your Usage:** Yes—with the leasehold filter bolted on this remains one of the fastest win patterns.

---

## Pattern 7: Permitted Development Rights

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides detailed indicator lists plus preset references for MA, Q, G, and Infill, including regulatory thresholds and excluded designations (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:400-522`).  
- Notes SearchLand’s pre-calculated profitability for Class MA, which is extremely helpful.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Omits Class AA rooftop extensions and Class ZA demolish-and-rebuild plays even though SearchLand has preset #33 for ZA (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:400-522`, `SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:378`).  
- Doesn’t address Article 4 direction coverage or prior approval timing, so analysts may inadvertently shortlist sites where PDRs are withdrawn.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add Class ZA guidance plus a warning on structural surveys for rooftop Class AA schemes.  
- Insert a “PDR eligibility” pre-check (Article 4, conservation area, size limits) with cross-reference to the Available Filters list.

**Your Usage:** Yes—PD routes are a staple, but I would immediately add Class ZA and Class AA coverage.

---

## Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- HMO licence expiry logic is well articulated with motivation timelines and filter sequences (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:523-591`).  
- Lease expiry pattern introduces precise time windows (6–24 months) tied to preset IDs such as #17 and #46.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Article 4 directions and EPC enforcement nuances are not explained, so analysts might breach local HMO caps or underestimate retrofit costs (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:592-676`).  
- Lease expiry opportunities really belong under Pattern 2 because the driver is behavioural, not regulatory—mixing them here dilutes the category purpose.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add an Article 4 map reference and MEES (Minimum Energy Efficiency Standard) deadlines per asset class.  
- Split lease expiry into Motivated Seller with a “regulation pressure” flag, keeping this section focused on true compliance triggers (licensing, EPC, enforcement).

**Your Usage:** Yes—the HMO and EPC plays are dependable, but I would mentally relocate lease expiries into my behavioural workflow.

---

## Pattern 9: Green Belt / Constraint Workarounds

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides specific thresholds for Grey Belt acreage, hardstanding %, and proximity to built-up areas, plus preset references (#7, #44) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-799`).  
- Edge-of-settlement promotion includes a six-step process and SHLAA guidance, which is rare in the other patterns.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Strategic Land sub-patterns (Emerging Allocations and Strategic Employment) live inside this section but are labelled as “Pattern 11” mergers, creating numbering confusion (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:805-905`).  
- No acknowledgement of nutrient neutrality or biodiversity net gain obligations even though these are acute in Green Belt-edge projects.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Break Strategic Land back out as Pattern 11 with its own header to avoid cross-referencing chaos.  
- Add a planning obligations checklist (BNG units, nutrient credits) so analysts budget for the real acceptance criteria.

**Your Usage:** Yes—Grey Belt and settlement edge filters are my primary rural sourcing method.

---

## Pattern 10: Renewable Energy

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Covers all major renewable asset classes (ground-mount solar, rooftop solar, BESS, hydrogen, wind) with concrete substation distance requirements and SIC code targeting (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:908-1048`).  
- Provides capital requirement guidance, which helps triage whether a developer should pursue or partner.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Treats fundamentally different business models (long-term infrastructure vs. opportunistic flips) as a single pattern, which overwhelms users looking for quick wins.  
- Omits grid-queue lead times and land agreement structures (lease vs. option), which are decisive factors in renewable deals.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Split into two patterns: “Utility-scale land plays” and “Industrial rooftop PPAs” with separate workflows and skill requirements.  
- Include a reminder to check NGESO queue status and DNO capacity maps before chasing titles.

**Your Usage:** Selectively—only rooftop solar (Pattern B) fits my capital stack; I would skip utility-scale unless I had an institutional partner.

---

## Pattern 11: Strategic Land (currently embedded in Pattern 9)

**Clarity:** Unclear (missing header)  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Emerging allocation play gives a step-by-step process and precise filters (housing allocation emerging + zero applications) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:805-855`).  
- Strategic employment land sub-pattern outlines acreage, allocation type, and road proximity requirements (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:866-904`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Lack of an actual “## 11” heading means the category is invisible from the table of contents, and the Master Matrix points to Pattern 11 even though readers can’t find it (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:9-25`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:102-126`).  
- No discussion on promotion agreements, planning costs, or long timelines (3–5 years) which are critical to strategic land decisions.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Restore Pattern 11 as a standalone section with sub-patterns for allocations and employment land, and summarise option vs. promotion contract structures.  
- Include expected timelines, likely capex for planning, and exit routes (e.g., sell to national housebuilder).

**Your Usage:** Yes—strategic promotions are bread and butter, but the document needs clearer signposting and cost guidance.

---

## Pattern 12: Commercial Traffic-Dependent

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Uses quantifiable metrics (footfall counts, vehicle counts, lease end dates) and references presets #27, #46, #54, #58, #72 (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1136-1249`).  
- Includes threshold cheat sheets (e.g., 800 vs. 6,000 footfall) which is exactly the type of quick decision aid missing elsewhere.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Bundles three very different sub-patterns (prime retail, drive-thru, niche markets), making it hard to know which preset to run in which round.  
- Lacks commentary on data coverage (footfall/vehicle counts are sparse outside major centres) and how to supplement them with local knowledge.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Split Pattern C into separate write-ups for padel vs. care homes; they need different datasets and outlets.  
- Add a data quality warning and suggested backup filters (e.g., “Within 200m of motorway” when vehicle counts don’t exist).

**Your Usage:** Occasionally—mainly for drive-thru/EV combos where traffic counters exist; I’d rarely use the padel/care-home mix without clearer guidance.

---

## Pattern 13: Time / Information Arbitrage

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Captures the core value proposition (daily exports, diffing results, immediate outreach) and even provides example scripts and deal flow timeline (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1773-1890`).  
- Emphasises capital readiness (option deposits, bridging lines) which is essential to execute these plays.

**Weaknesses:**  
- No practical instructions on how to automate the exports (API endpoints, CSV structure) or how to store comparisons, so non-technical agents can’t stand it up quickly.  
- Lacks SLA guidance for contacting owners (e.g., how to find contact details within hours), and doesn’t link to supporting SOPs.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add a short “tooling” appendix with a Python diff script outline and recommended alert thresholds.  
- Include a contact acquisition workflow (e.g., Land Registry download, company director lookup) so the “call same day” directive is achievable.

**Your Usage:** Absolutely—this is the highest-ROCE workflow when combined with Patterns 1, 2, or 8.

---

## PART 2: NEW PATTERNS PROPOSED

### NEW PATTERN: Unbroken Freehold Break-Up

**Category:** Low Capital Entry / Motivated Seller  
**Strategic Rationale:** Acquiring multi-address freeholds with zero leaseholds allows you to split titles or sell flats individually, extracting uplift without heavy construction. Preset #1 already packages the necessary filters (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:7`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Ownership: Freehold, private owner.  
2. Addresses: 3–15 addresses on one title.  
3. Leaseholds: Exactly 0 leaseholds.  
4. Use class: Only C3 dwellings (easy resales).  
**Sourced From:** Preset #1 (Unbroken Freeholds).  
**Use Cases:** Break up into individual leases, add airspace rights, or sell to shared ownership providers.  
**Expected Results:** Typically 20–60 titles per LPA; 10–20% margin uplift from splitting plus potential airspace sale.

---

### NEW PATTERN: Article 4 Escape Hatch HMOs

**Category:** Regulation-Driven  
**Strategic Rationale:** Outside Article 4 areas, Class C3 homes can still be converted to HMOs via permitted development. Preset #19 screens for properties that are not already HMOs and sit outside Article 4 directions, giving a shovel-ready pipeline (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:218`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: C3, exactly one address.  
2. NOT Article 4 directions.  
3. Ownership: Company or private.  
4. Status: NOT already HMO, NOT currently listed.  
**Sourced From:** Preset #19.  
**Use Cases:** Investors needing ready-to-convert stock in secondary towns before MEES/EPC tightening pushes rents up.  
**Expected Results:** 50–150 sites per wider metro; GDV uplift of £150–£250 per monthly room rent after conversion.

---

### NEW PATTERN: Leasehold Sunset Recapture

**Category:** Time / Information Arbitrage  
**Strategic Rationale:** Individual flats with leases expiring before 2099 become almost unmortgageable as the term decays, so landlords are motivated to re-gear or sell at a discount. Preset #78 captures precisely these leases (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:893`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: C3, one address.  
2. Lease end date: within X years (configurable).  
3. Ownership: NOT council.  
**Sourced From:** Preset #78 plus Companies House charges.  
**Use Cases:** Negotiate lease extensions, collect reverse premiums, or assemble blocks for enfranchisement.  
**Expected Results:** 100–200 entries per London borough; 15–25% uplift upon re-gearing and resale.

---

### NEW PATTERN: Class ZA Quick Rebuild

**Category:** Permitted Development (PDR)  
**Strategic Rationale:** Class ZA allows demolition of small commercial buildings (<1,000 sq m, <18m roof) and rebuild as residential, offering a faster route than full planning. Preset #33 already isolates compliant titles (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:378`).  
**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: E(g)(i)-(iii).  
2. Building size: <1,000 sq m.  
3. Roof height: <18m.  
4. NOT conservation area / listed / AONB.  
**Sourced From:** Preset #33 plus EPC data for energy upgrades.  
**Use Cases:** Rapidly repurpose obsolete light industrial sheds in commuter towns into 4–10 units without a full committee battle.  
**Expected Results:** 30–80 assets per LPA; 20–30% margin improvement by saving 6–12 months of planning time.

---

## PART 3: STRUCTURE & USABILITY

- The document lists 13 categories at the top but the body now contains 21 numbered patterns and Pattern 11 is hidden inside Pattern 9, creating a navigation mismatch (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:9-25`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-905`). Introduce a canonical index that lists every pattern/sub-pattern with anchors and ensures numbers match.  
- Master Strategy Matrix references pattern numbers 12, 14–21 while skipping 11 entirely, so the quick-look table cannot be trusted (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:102-126`). Rebuild this matrix dynamically (maybe as a CSV) so it always reflects the real pattern list, and include key filters + preset IDs in each row.  
- Round Guide names patterns (“Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly”, “Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion”) that no longer exist, which will only confuse collaborating agents (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:134-149`). Add round-specific mini-lists drawn from actual pattern titles plus tags (#LowCapital #Regulation etc.) to make lookup immediate.  
- For each pattern, add a two-line “Filter Snapshot” (fields + threshold + preset) and a “Common Failure Modes” box so agents can triage results faster.  
- Provide a decision tree or checklist (capital level, timeline, risk appetite) that references tags rather than raw numbers, letting the reader quickly jump to 2–3 relevant patterns.

## PART 4: PATTERN RANKING

| Rank | Pattern # | Pattern Name | Why This Ranking? |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 8 | Regulation-Driven | Direct legal deadlines (HMO licences, MEES) create predictable seller behaviour and can be executed with clear filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:523-676`). |
| 2 | 13 | Time/Information Arbitrage | Speed-based workflow consistently produces outsized spreads when layered onto any other pattern (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1773-1890`). |
| 3 | 2 | Motivated Seller | Combines multiple distress signals and liquidation triggers, generating immediate negotiation leverage (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:58-224`). |
| 4 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | Planning groundwork is already done; adding a motivation layer often unlocks sub-market deals (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`). |
| 5 | 3 | Development Opportunity | Bread-and-butter densification logic that underpins most MixedUse briefs when layered with Pattern 5. |
| 6 | 7 | Permitted Development | Clear regulatory pathways (MA/Q/G) accelerate delivery without full planning (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:400-522`). |
| 7 | 5 | High-Density/Intensification | Gives the framework for 6–8 storey infill, especially around high PTAL nodes (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:322-348`). |
| 8 | 6 | Airspace Development | Offers a low-capital path to add units where land is expensive, provided leaseholds are manageable (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:368-394`). |
| 9 | 9 | Green Belt/Constraint | Unlocks cheaper land, though timelines are longer and politics heavier (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-799`). |
| 10 | 10 | Renewable Energy | Attractive margins but usually needs specialist partners and grid expertise (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:908-1048`). |
| 11 | 12 | Commercial Traffic-Dependent | Useful when footfall data exists, but dataset coverage is patchy (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1136-1299`). |
| 12 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | Supply is very limited and the filters are still vague, so hit-rate is low (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:274-316`). |
| 13 | 11 | Strategic Land | Enormous upside but multi-year timelines and hidden costs make it less practical for most briefs (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:805-905`). |

**Real-World Test (MixedUse-8Storey-£2M profit brief):**  
I would start with Pattern 5 (intensification) to locate PTAL 4–6 low-rise plots; overlay Pattern 1 to grab those with stalled mixed-use permissions, then layer Pattern 2 (corporate derelicts) to prioritise motivated sellers. If policy support is weak, I’d check Pattern 6 (airspace on existing mixed-use blocks) to hit the storey count without full demolition.

---

## PART 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

- **Round Mapping:** Current Round Guide references non-existent pattern names and doesn’t show which filters map to each round (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:134-172`). Create a “Round Quick Sheet” where each round lists 3–4 patterns with tags (Capital, Timeline, Category) and links directly to preset IDs.  
- **Round-Specific Prompts:** Provide short playbooks (e.g., “Round 2: If no precedent found, switch to Pattern 7C or Pattern 9A”) so collaborating LLMs don’t spin in circles during divergent ideation.  
- **Monitoring Hooks:** For Pattern 13, publish a shared cron/automation spec so every agent knows how to request daily exports and where the diff outputs live.  
- **Behavioural Round Assets:** Round 4 currently lacks explicit references to Patterns 2 and 14–15 (both behavioural); add a behavioural matrix to highlight which filters show seller psychology cues.  
- **Feedback Loop:** Encourage agents to note outcomes back into LEARNINGS_DATABASE so the “Strengths/Weaknesses” sections evolve beyond static text.

---

## SUMMARY

**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**  
1. Fix navigation and numbering: reintroduce a proper Pattern 11 section and align the Master Matrix/Round Guide with the actual 21 patterns (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:9-149`, `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:682-905`).  
2. Add preset-linked filter snapshots + decision aids for every pattern so analysts can execute without rebuilding the logic manually.  
3. Expand regulatory and workflow details (Article 4, MEES, automation scripts) so high-value patterns like 8 and 13 are immediately actionable.

**Confidence in Current Patterns:** Medium – the ideas are solid, but missing execution detail slows adoption.

**Would You Use This Document?** With Changes – I need the structural fixes and filter snapshots before treating it as a go-to playbook.

**Overall Grade:** B-

- Includes both keyword-based and date-based approaches
- Recognizes that "expired" isn't directly filterable, offering workarounds

**Weaknesses:**
- Could benefit from more examples of proposal keywords beyond "development type"
- Doesn't address how to verify if planning has truly lapsed (requires manual research)

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add specific keyword examples (e.g., "residential", "mixed-use", "storey")
- Include risk assessment for sites with very old planning (may have changed circumstances)

**Your Usage:** Would use this pattern frequently for opportunistic planning derisking, especially in areas with high planning activity.

## Pattern 2: Motivated Seller Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Covers multiple motivation signals (corporate holdings, long listings, transport proximity)
- Includes the excellent "Liquidation/Administration Sales" addition
- Combines motivation with development rationale

**Weaknesses:**
- Pattern D (Liquidation) is very brief compared to others
- Could expand on how to identify liquidation companies beyond SearchLand filters

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add more detail on liquidation process and buyer advantages
- Include proxy filters for motivation when direct signals aren't available

**Your Usage:** Essential for behavioral approaches; the liquidation pattern is particularly strong for distressed acquisitions.

## Pattern 3: Development Opportunity Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Mostly Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Good coverage of under-developed sites and existing approvals
- Includes PTAL and accessibility factors
- Recognizes capital requirements vary

**Weaknesses:**
- PTAL limited to London; needs UK-wide alternatives
- Pattern C is quite broad and could be split into more specific strategies

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add non-London transport accessibility proxies (train station distance)
- Break Pattern C into "Existing Income-Generating" and "Intensification Potential" sub-patterns

**Your Usage:** Would use for structural arbitrage, but prefer more specific patterns for particular development types.

## Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete

## PART 2: NEW PATTERNS PROPOSED

Based on reviewing the raw presets in PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md, I identified several patterns Claude missed or could have elevated further. Here are 4 new patterns:

## NEW PATTERN: Agricultural Land Conversion

**Category:** Rural Development Strategies

**Strategic Rationale:**
Agricultural land represents vast opportunity for development, but requires careful navigation of planning policies. Lower-grade agricultural land (Grade 3b/4/5) has weaker protection than prime agricultural land, making conversion more feasible. This pattern targets sites where farming economics make landowners receptive to diversification.

**Key Filters:**
1. Agricultural Land Grade: is one of 3b, 4, 5 (NOT 1-2)
2. Use class: is equal to Agricultural
3. Title area (acres): is greater than 5
4. Distance to nearest built up area (m): is less than 1000
5. Ownership type: is equal to Private owner

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #39 (Nutrient Neutrality) - but broader application
- General agricultural economics knowledge
- Observed gap in rural development strategies

**Use Cases:**
- Rural housing schemes on lower-grade land
- Agricultural diversification (e.g., polytunnels to housing)
- Sites where farming income insufficient for viability

**Expected Results:**
- 50-200 results per rural LPA
- Conversion rates: 10-20% with proper approach
- Capital: £100k-£500k per acre for development

## NEW PATTERN: Listed Building Opportunities

**Category:** Heritage Development Strategies

**Strategic Rationale:**
Listed buildings offer development potential through sympathetic extensions, conversions, or change of use, but require heritage expertise. Many listed buildings are underutilized or in poor condition, creating motivated owners. This pattern targets sites where listing status can be leveraged rather than avoided.

**Key Filters:**
1. Listed building(s) in plot: Yes
2. Building on title is derelict: is equal to Yes
3. Use class: is one of Residential institutions, Commercial
4. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.1
5. Distance to nearest conservation area (m): is less than 500

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #37 (Educational sites) - but broader heritage application
- General heritage development knowledge
- Observed gap in constraint-based strategies

**Use Cases:**
- Listed building conversions to residential
- Heritage asset enhancement schemes
- Sites requiring sympathetic development

**Expected Results:**
- 20-100 results per historic LPA
- Planning success: 60-80% with heritage consultant
- Capital: £200k-£1M+ depending on scale

## NEW PATTERN: Flood Risk Area Redevelopment

**Category:** Constraint Workaround Strategies

**Strategic Rationale:**
Flood risk areas are often undervalued despite development potential. Sequential test and exception policies allow development in Flood Zone 3 with proper mitigation. Many sites have existing development, reducing flood risk concerns. This pattern targets brownfield sites in flood areas where redevelopment is permitted.

**Key Filters:**
1. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 2: is less than 50
2. Percentage of title covered by Flood Zone 3: is greater than 10
3. Developed area percentage: is greater than 25
4. Use class: is one of Industrial, Commercial
5. Title area (acres): is greater than 0.5

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #52 (Bio-energy) - flood zone exclusions
- General flood risk policy knowledge
- Observed gap in environmental constraint strategies

**Use Cases:**
- Brownfield redevelopment in flood areas
- Flood-resilient housing schemes
- Sites where existing development proves viability

**Expected Results:**
- 30-150 results per flood-prone LPA
- Planning success: 40-60% with flood risk assessment
- Capital: £150k-£750k with mitigation costs

## NEW PATTERN: Conservation Area Enhancement

**Category:** Heritage Development Strategies

**Strategic Rationale:**
Conservation areas protect character but allow appropriate development. Many properties in conservation areas are tired or underutilized, creating opportunities for enhancement schemes. Local authorities often support improvements that enhance character. This pattern targets sites where conservation status can be used to access grants and permissions.

**Key Filters:**
1. Percentage of title covered by Conservation Areas: is greater than 50
2. Building on title is inactive: is equal to Yes
3. EPC rating: is one of E, F, G
4. Use class: is one of Residential, Commercial
5. Distance to nearest listed building (m): is less than 200

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #33 (Class ZA) - conservation area exclusions
- General conservation area policy knowledge
- Observed gap in area-based strategies

**Use Cases:**
- Conservation area regeneration projects
- Heritage grant-funded improvements
- Sites requiring character enhancement

**Expected Results:**
- 40-120 results per conservation area LPA
- Planning success: 70-85% for appropriate schemes
- Capital: £100k-£400k with potential grants

## PART 3: STRUCTURE & USABILITY

### Structural Improvement: Master Pattern Index

**Current Problem:**
The document has patterns scattered across categories without a clear navigation index. Users must scroll through to find relevant patterns.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add a comprehensive index at the top with pattern numbers, names, capital ranges, risk levels, and key use cases. Include quick-reference tags for Round mapping.

**Example:**
```
## Master Pattern Index

| # | Pattern Name | Capital | Risk | Best For | Round |
|---|--------------|---------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Expired Planning | £50k-£200k | Med | Planning expertise | 2 |
| 2 | Motivated Seller | £100k-£500k | Low-Med | Negotiation | 4 |
...
```

**Benefit:**
Allows quick pattern selection based on constraints, reducing time to find relevant strategies.

### Structural Improvement: Pattern Interconnections

**Current Problem:**
Patterns are presented in isolation, but many work best in combination (e.g., Motivated Seller + PDR).

**Proposed Solution:**
Add "Pattern Combinations" section with proven synergies and example applications.

**Example:**
```
## Pattern Combinations

**High-ROI Combo: Pattern 2A + 7A**
- Motivated corporate seller + Class MA PDR
- Capital: £100k-£300k
- Why: Fast execution, motivated seller accepts lower profit split
- Example: Derelict commercial building owned by company 10+ years
```

**Benefit:**
Helps users combine patterns for more effective strategies rather than using them singly.

### Structural Improvement: Decision Tree Navigation

**Current Problem:**
No guidance on which pattern to choose based on user constraints.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add interactive decision tree at the beginning.

**Example:**
```
## Quick Pattern Selector

**Capital Available?**
- <£50k → See Patterns 4A, 13A
- £50k-£200k → See Patterns 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
- >£500k → See Patterns 3, 5, 10, 11

**Timeline?**
- <6 months → PDR patterns (7)
- 6-12 months → Regulation-driven (8), Motivated seller (2)
- 1-2 years → Planning-based (1, 3, 5)
```

**Benefit:**
Reduces decision paralysis by guiding users to appropriate patterns based on their situation.

### Structural Improvement: Preset Cross-References

**Current Problem:**
While patterns reference presets, there's no easy way to see all patterns from a given preset.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add "Reverse Lookup" table showing which patterns use each preset.

**Example:**
```
## Preset-to-Pattern Mapping

**Preset #4 (Class MA):** Pattern 7A
**Preset #12 (HMO Expired):** Pattern 8A, 15A
**Preset #14 (Solar Ground):** Pattern 10A
...
```

**Benefit:**
Helps users understand pattern sourcing and find related strategies.

## PART 4: PATTERN RANKING

| Rank | Pattern # | Pattern Name | Why This Ranking? |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 13 | Time/Information Arbitrage | Highest ROI potential through speed advantage; force multiplier for other patterns |
| 2 | 8 | Regulation-Driven | Strong motivation signals (HMO, EPC, leases); reliable distress indicators |
| 3 | 7 | PDR Strategies | Fast-track development without full planning; proven profit calculations |
| 4 | 2 | Motivated Seller | Essential for negotiation-based approaches; multiple motivation angles |
| 5 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | Critical for capital-constrained buyers; realistic entry points |
| 6 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | Good for planning derisking; targets stalled opportunities |
| 7 | 9 | Green Belt Workarounds | Useful constraint navigation; grey belt opportunities |
| 8 | 3 | Development Opportunity | Solid for structural approaches; good intensification coverage |
| 9 | 12 | Commercial Traffic | Valuable data-driven viability; strong for commercial |
| 10 | 5 | High-Density | Useful for tall buildings; requires local knowledge |
| 11 | 6 | Airspace | Creative but complex; high expertise barrier |
| 12 | 11 | Strategic Land | Long-term potential; high barrier to entry |
| 13 | 10 | Renewable Energy | Niche institutional scale; limited applicability |

**Real-World Test:**
For the MixedUse-8Storey-2M project, I would reference:
1. **Pattern 13 (Time Arbitrage)** - Monitor for fresh planning consents on similar schemes
2. **Pattern 7 (PDR)** - Check Class MA eligibility for commercial elements
3. **Pattern 5 (High-Density)** - Research tall building policy zones
4. **Pattern 2 (Motivated Seller)** - Target corporate owners of suitable sites
5. **Pattern 8 (Regulation-Driven)** - Look for HMO expiry or EPC distress signals

This combination provides speed, derisking, and motivation angles for the £2M profit target.

---

## PART 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### Round-Specific Pattern Mapping Enhancement

**Current Problem:**
The collaborative round guide is good but could be more prescriptive.

**Proposed Solution:**
Create detailed round playbooks with pattern sequences.

**Example:**
```
## Round 2: Precedent Analysis - Pattern Sequence

**Phase 1: Broad Research (Patterns 1, 3, 5)**
- Find similar approved schemes
- Identify planning precedents

**Phase 2: Constraint Navigation (Patterns 7, 9)**
- Check PDR eligibility
- Assess green belt workarounds

**Phase 3: Motivation Layer (Patterns 2, 8, 13)**
- Add seller motivation signals
- Apply time arbitrage monitoring
```

**Benefit:**
Provides structured approach within each round rather than just listing patterns.

### Pattern Readiness Checklist

**Current Problem:**
No guidance on pattern implementation requirements.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add readiness checklists for each pattern.

**Example:**
```
## Pattern 7A (Class MA) Readiness Checklist

☐ Verified SearchLand filter syntax
☐ Confirmed PDR eligibility criteria current
☐ Prepared profit calculation methodology
☐ Identified local authority PDR contacts
☐ Assessed Article 4 restrictions in target areas
☐ Prepared conversion cost estimates
```

**Benefit:**
Ensures users have necessary preparation before applying patterns.

### Integration with LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md

**Current Problem:**
Patterns reference LEARNINGS_DATABASE but no structured integration.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add "Technical Implementation" links to each pattern.

**Example:**
```
**Technical Details:** See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "HMO License Expiry Date"
**Filter Syntax:** See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "Proposal Text Search"
```

**Benefit:**
Connects strategic patterns to technical implementation details.

### Success Metrics Tracking

**Current Problem:**
No way to measure pattern effectiveness.

**Proposed Solution:**
Add success tracking template.

**Example:**
```
## Pattern Performance Tracking

**Pattern 7A (Class MA):**
- Sites identified: __
- PDR eligible: __ (__%)
- Planning submitted: __
- Consents granted: __ (__%)
- Average profit: £__
```

**Benefit:**
Enables continuous improvement of pattern effectiveness.

---

## SUMMARY

**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**
1. **Add decision tree navigation** - Users need guidance on pattern selection based on their constraints (capital, timeline, expertise)
2. **Include pattern combination guidance** - Most value comes from combining patterns (e.g., motivation + PDR), not using singly
3. **Integrate technical implementation details** - Bridge gap between strategic patterns and SearchLand filter syntax

**Confidence in Current Patterns:** High - Claude did excellent work analyzing presets and creating reusable strategies

**Would You Use This Document?** Yes, with the structural improvements above - it's already very useful but could be more actionable

**Overall Grade:** A- (Excellent foundation with room for usability enhancements)

=== UPDATED POSITIONS AFTER ITERATION ===

Loaded cached credentials.
### Disagreement 1: Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage) - Classification & Priority

**My Original Position:** Ranked #10 (low priority); stated it's "not a *filter* pattern" but a "workflow"; recommended moving it out of the patterns list entirely into an "Advanced Workflow" section.
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Ranked #3 (high priority); treats it as a legitimate pattern with "high ROI"; states it "converts SearchLand's daily refresh into unique deal flow."

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- I have changed my mind. I was too focused on the taxonomic purity of the list and incorrectly conflated its classification as a "workflow" with it having low importance.
- Codex is right to rank its value at #3. The argument that it "converts SearchLand's daily refresh into unique deal flow" is the single most important strategic insight in the entire document. My low ranking was a mistake.
- The best solution is a synthesis of both positions: I was right about *what* it is (a workflow), but Codex was right about *how valuable* it is. It should be separated structurally, but its importance must be highlighted.

**FINAL POSITION:** I will adopt a synthesized position. I maintain that Pattern 13 should be moved out of the flat list of filter patterns and into its own "Advanced Workflow" or "Meta-Strategy" section, as I originally proposed. However, I was wrong to rank it as low priority. This new section should be given top-level prominence in the document, and its description should explicitly state that it is one of the highest ROI strategies, reflecting Codex's #3 ranking.

---

### Disagreement 2: Pattern 11 (Strategic Land Promotion) - Structural Organization

**My Original Position:** Suggested merging Pattern 11 with Pattern 9B, stating the category felt redundant and should be consolidated.
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Treats Pattern 11 as a standalone category needing expansion, recommending the addition of "sub-patterns for SHLAA omissions and legacy estates."

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- I was wrong. My attempt to merge the patterns was an oversimplification that would have destroyed valuable nuance.
- Codex's position is more robust. "Strategic Land Promotion" is a deep and distinct field from "Green Belt Workarounds." While they can overlap, they are not the same. Codex's suggestion to expand Pattern 11 with more sub-patterns (like SHLAA omissions) proves that the category has enough substance to stand on its own.
- Merging them would make the document less useful for specialists focused on long-term land promotion.

**FINAL POSITION:** I have changed my mind and fully adopt Codex's position. Pattern 11 should remain a standalone category. Furthermore, it should be expanded as Codex suggests to include sub-patterns for SHLAA omissions and other related strategies, making it a more comprehensive and useful section. My original position was incorrect.

# FILTER_PATTERNS.md PEER REVIEW TASK

**Reviewer:** [Gemini / Codex - you are reviewing Claude's work]  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Purpose:** Critique and improve FILTER_PATTERNS.md for better usability

---

## YOUR TASK

You are an expert UK property analyst reviewing Claude's `FILTER_PATTERNS.md` document. This document contains 13 strategic filter patterns derived from analyzing 86 SearchLand preset filters.

**IMPORTANT:** You are working INDEPENDENTLY. You won't see other reviewers' feedback until later. Provide YOUR OWN analysis without trying to coordinate or collaborate.

**Your job:**
1. **Critique existing patterns** - Are they clear? Complete? Useful?
2. **Suggest new patterns** - What did Claude miss?
3. **Optimize for YOUR usage** - How would you structure this for easier application?

DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS:

Total Patterns Reviewed: 13
Significant Disagreements Found: 2

### Disagreement 1: Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage) - Classification & Priority

**Gemini Position:** Ranked #10 (low priority); states it's "not a *filter* pattern" but a "workflow"; recommends moving it out of the patterns list entirely into "Advanced Workflow" section
**Codex Position:** Ranked #3 (high priority); treats it as legitimate pattern with "high ROI"; states it "converts SearchLand's daily refresh into unique deal flow"
**Conflict:** Gemini sees Pattern 13 as categorically misplaced (not even a real pattern), while Codex sees it as one of the top 3 most valuable patterns
**Requires Iteration:** YES

### Disagreement 2: Pattern 11 (Strategic Land Promotion) - Structural Organization

**Gemini Position:** Suggests merging Pattern 11 with Pattern 9B; states "This pattern category feels redundant"; recommends consolidation

## Pattern 11: Strategic Land Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights emerging allocations with no planning and large employment allocations (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1053`).  
- Provides option-cost guidance (£10k-£50k) which helps scoping.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores other strategic presets (edge-of-settlement #13/#18, unallocated no SHLAA #85/#86) that broaden the funnel (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-222` and `845-857`).  
- No instructions on Local Plan timelines, Regulation 18/19 stages, or promotion agreement structuring.

239:- Correctly identifies the "first mover" advantage of targeting emerging allocations with no planning yet (Pattern 11A).
242:- This pattern category feels redundant. Pattern 11A is very similar to Pattern 9B. They are both about promoting land for allocation. They should be merged or more clearly differentiated.
243:- Pattern 11B is a good, distinct strategy for large employment land.
246:- **Merge Pattern 11A into 9B.** Rename Pattern 9 to "Strategic Land & Green Belt" and have two sub-patterns: 9A (Grey Belt) and 9B (Land Promotion), where 9B combines the insights from the current 9B and 11A.
247:- Keep Pattern 11B but move it under the new merged category, perhaps as "Pattern 9C: Strategic Employment Land".

### **Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful (conceptually)  

**Strengths:**
- This is a brilliant, high-level strategic concept. It correctly identifies that the 24-hour refresh cycle of SearchLand creates a window of opportunity.
- The examples (Fresh Planning Consent, Lease Expiry Pre-Contact) are concrete and illustrate the value of speed.

**Weaknesses:**
- This is not a *filter* pattern. It's a *workflow* or *process* that sits on top of other filter patterns. It requires external automation (scripts, alerts) that are outside the scope of SearchLand itself.
- It's presented as a pattern, but it's really a meta-strategy for *how to use* the other patterns.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- **Move this entire section.** Create a new top-level section in the document called "Advanced Workflow: Time & Information Arbitrage" or move it into the "Structure & Usability" part of the review. It doesn't belong in the list of filter patterns.
- Reframe it as a "how-to" guide for setting up a monitoring system that leverages the other patterns.

**Your Usage:** I would use this *process* every single day. But I wouldn't look for it in a list of *filter patterns*. The concept is A-grade, but its placement is confusing.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)

1. Freehold tenure
2. Private owner ownership
3. 1,000-8,000 sqmt
4. Less than 5% area developed
5. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no activity)
6. No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
7. 1-10% built up area coverage (edge location)
8. More than 80% un-constrained

Un-Allocated No SHLAA (Preset #85):
1. NOT SHLAA positive/neutral/negative (not assessed!)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m of settlement boundary
4. Company or private owner
5. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)

Strategy:
1. Identify edge-of-settlement sites
2. Secure option agreement (low capital)
3. Promote to local authority (planning consultancy)

- Policy backing (allocated in plan)
- Lower competition (not yet discovered by housebuilders)
- Can secure option before planning (low capital)
- Planning risk reduced (policy support)

Weaknesses:
- Emerging = not yet adopted (could change)
- Still needs planning permission
- Section 106 obligations likely

Capital requirement:
- Option: £10k-£50k
- Planning costs: £50k-£200k
- Exit to housebuilder at planning stage

Strategy:
1. Identify emerging allocations with no planning
2. Secure option agreement with landowner
3. Apply for planning (first in)
4. Sell to housebuilder with consent

### Pattern A: Grey Belt Exception
```
Strategy: Previously developed land in Green Belt (exception to protection)
Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

   457	    *   **Niche & Specialist:** (Patterns 10, 12).

| 6 | 9 | Green Belt Workarounds | Niche but valuable guidance on previously developed land exceptions (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:610-726`). |
| 7 | 12 | Commercial Traffic Strategies | Quantified demand metrics yet needs competitive context (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1059-1223`). |
| 8 | 3 | Development Opportunity Strategies | Useful heuristics but lacks preset mapping and thresholds (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:156-195`). |
| 9 | 5 | High-Density/Intensification | Highlights PTAL but thin on execution detail (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-288`). |
|10 | 11 | Strategic Land Promotion | Describes only part of the preset set and omits plan process steps (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1053`). |
|11 | 6 | Airspace Development | Captures basics but misses key preset variants and legal workflow (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`). |
|12 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | Relies on scarce on-market deals; limited presets referenced (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:202-242`). |
|13 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | Too vague on filters/status logic to implement reliably (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`). |

**Real-World Test:** For “MixedUse-8Storey-2M profit on £200k capital,” I’d combine Pattern 5 (tall building zones) to target policy-backed height (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-274`), Pattern 6 (airspace) for adding storeys to existing low-rise stock (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`), and Pattern 2D (liquidation) to cap acquisition price (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:100-150`). Overlay Pattern 13B’s monitoring so we pounce on fresh consents matching those filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1303-1319`).

**Composing detailed final positions document**

I'm preparing a structured final response with two main sections addressing Pattern 13 and Pattern 11, referencing specific lines in the review files. I'll clearly outline original stances, reconsiderations citing relevant documents, and final positions with reasoning for reclassification and merging, ensuring proper formatting with headings and bullet points as requested.
codex
### Disagreement: Pattern 13 Classification & Priority

**My Original Position:** I treated Time/Information Arbitrage as a core filter pattern, ranked it #3 overall, and recommended incremental detail (templates, prioritisation) while keeping it inside the pattern list (`Review_Codex.md:1125-1145`, `Review_Codex.md:1266-1280`).  
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Gemini argues the section is actually a workflow layer that should be moved out of the numbered patterns into an “Advanced Workflow: Real-Time Monitoring” area (`Review_Gemini.md:274-292`, `Review_Gemini.md:447-459`).

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- After re-reading the source, 80% of Pattern 13 documents export cadence, diffing, alerts, and response protocols rather than new filter stacks (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1281-1396`). The only SearchLand-specific instructions simply point back to earlier filters (planning status, lease expiry) and then shift into tooling requirements, confirming Gemini’s point that this is meta-process, not a standalone pattern inventoried alongside, say, Green Belt proxies.
- Keeping it in the ranked list caused me to overstate its independence and inflate its priority relative to genuine filter combinations. Relocating it clarifies taxonomy while still preserving its high ROI content. I’ll advocate for a dedicated “Advanced Workflow” annex that references the relevant patterns (e.g., cite Patterns 2, 8, 12 wherever the arbitrage triggers rely on their filters) plus provide the export/alert stack there.
- My updated ranking drops the numeric slot and instead calls out the workflow as a “force multiplier” attached to whichever pattern you’re monitoring. This mirrors Gemini’s placement request but keeps the emphasis on use.

**FINAL POSITION:** Time/Information Arbitrage should move out of the 13-pattern list into an “Advanced Workflow” section that cross-references the underlying filters; it remains strategically vital but should no longer hold a numbered rank.

---

### Disagreement: Pattern 11 vs. Pattern 9B (Strategic Land Organisation)

**My Original Position:** I argued Pattern 11 needed expansion (extra SHLAA/edge presets, Local Plan workflow) and should remain a standalone category for land-promotion strategies (`Review_Codex.md:1077-1097`).  
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Gemini sees Pattern 11A as redundant with Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement Promotion) and recommends merging them under a single “Strategic Land & Green Belt” category, folding 11B in as a sub-pattern as well (`Review_Gemini.md:232-249`).

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- Pattern 9B already covers settlement-edge, unallocated land with SHLAA context (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:664-724`). Pattern 11A then repeats the same plot size, option, and plan-promotion logic but tags it as “Emerging allocations” (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1014`). The distinction I thought existed (allocated vs. unallocated) isn’t surfaced in the current taxonomy; both live under separate top-level categories despite serving the same “promote land into the Local Plan” workflow.
- Gemini’s consolidation removes this duplication and matches how agents decide in practice: first pick whether you’re chasing policy-backed Green Belt exceptions (Pattern 9A at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:608-663`) or land-promotion plays, then drill into sub-patterns for unallocated edges (current 9B) versus newly allocated parcels (current 11A) versus strategic employment (current 11B at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1017-1053`). That hierarchy is clearer than maintaining two disjointed sections.
- I still want the extra guidance I called for (Local Plan timelines, infra costs), but that content can live inside the merged “Strategic Land Promotion” cluster. There’s no benefit to keeping duplicate headings, so I’m adopting Gemini’s structural proposal and will focus my follow-up edits on enriching the consolidated section.

**FINAL POSITION:** Merge Pattern 11A with Pattern 9B under a single “Strategic Land & Green Belt” category (sub-patterns for grey-belt exceptions, edge promotion/unallocated, emerging allocations, and strategic employment), then add the missing process guidance inside that unified section rather than keeping two overlapping top-level patterns.

## Collaborative Round Guide 🔄

Maps patterns to exploration rounds in the v3.2.0 workflow:

### Round 2: Precedent Analysis
**Goal:** Which patterns help replicate successful planning applications?
- Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning (find similar approved schemes)
- Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (PTAL matching)
- Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly (precedent for infill)
- Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion (prior approvals)

**Why these patterns?** These rely on demonstrating that similar developments have been approved nearby or on similar sites. Success depends on finding comparable precedents.

### Round 3: Regulation-Driven
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit regulatory drivers and deadlines?
- Pattern 7: Permitted Development (Class AA, Q, MA, ZA rights)
- Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Article 4, expiring conditions)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (enforcement, S215 notices)

**Why these patterns?** These opportunities are created by regulatory changes, deadlines, or enforcement actions that create urgency or unlock new rights.

### Round 4: Structural Arbitrage
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit physical characteristics and constraints?
- Pattern 6: Airspace Development (roof extensions, party wall arbitrage)
- Pattern 9: Green Belt/Strategic Land (boundary anomalies, brownfield)
- Pattern 3: Underutilized/Inefficient Sites (layout inefficiencies)
- Pattern 4: Title/Access Issues (ransom strips, easements)

**Why these patterns?** These exploit physical, spatial, or legal constraints that others overlook or cannot solve. Value creation comes from structural problem-solving.

### Round 5: Behavioral/Motivation
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit seller motivation and market timing?
- Pattern 2: Motivated Seller (estate settlements, divorces, financial distress)
- Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage (Advanced Workflow) (emerging allocations, infrastructure announcements)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (combined with motivation)

**Why these patterns?** These depend on understanding seller psychology, market inefficiencies, and information asymmetries. Success requires empathy and timing.

### Cross-Round Patterns
Some patterns work across multiple rounds:
- **Pattern 11** (Distressed Assets): Regulation-driven (enforcement) + Behavioral (motivated seller)
- **Pattern 1** (Expired Planning): Precedent Analysis (prior approval) + Behavioral (frustrated owner)
- **Pattern 13** (Time Arbitrage): Regulation-Driven (policy changes) + Behavioral (information gaps)

```
Strategy: Properties with low EPC ratings (cannot rent until improved)
Source: SearchLand Presets #2, #20, #36, #47, #67, #69
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- EPC rating: E, F, G (cannot rent legally)
- Private owner (not professional landlord)
- Long hold period (tired owner)
- No recent sales activity

Regulation:
- Private rented sector: Minimum EPC E since 2020
- Improvement costs: £5k-£50k depending on property

## 9. Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: Grey Belt Exception
```
Strategy: Previously developed land in Green Belt (exception to protection)
Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

Strengths:
- Access to Green Belt locations (often cheaper)
- Exception to normal GB restrictions
- Less competition (many avoid GB entirely)

Weaknesses:
- Still needs planning (not automatic)
- Local opposition possible
- Must prove "previously developed"

Capital requirement: Often cheaper than pure urban (£50k-£300k)

Example Filters:

Grey Belt (Preset #7):
1. Freehold tenure
2. More than 25% area developed
3. More than 10% hardstanding (key indicator)
4. Within 100m of built up area
5. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3, National parks, Conservation area, etc.
6. 1,000+ sqmt

Grey Belt Low Impact (Preset #44):
1. Green Belt Review score: 1 or 2 (low environmental impact)
2. More than 25% hardstanding
3. Within 100m of built up area
4. NOT: Flood zone 3, Conservation area, AONB

Strategic Insight:
"Previously developed land in Green Belt" = exception
Hardstanding % = proxy for "previously developed"

Related: Presets #7, #43, #44, #45 (GB solar)
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "Hardstanding percentage"

- NOT SHLAA assessed OR negative (hidden gems)
- Private owner (easier to deal)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 5% developed (undeveloped land)

Strategic Rationale:
- Local authorities review settlement boundaries periodically
- Sites on edges = natural expansion direction
- No SHLAA = no one else promoting (first mover advantage)
- Promote to get allocated in next local plan

Strengths:
- Lower competition (undiscovered)
- Can influence local plan
- Option agreements with minimal capital
- Value jump when allocated

Weaknesses:
- Long timeline (2-5 years for allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation
- Requires planning expertise

Capital requirement: Low for option (£5k-£50k), patient capital

Example Filters:

Edge of Settlement (Preset #18):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Private owner ownership
3. 1,000-8,000 sqmt
4. Less than 5% area developed
5. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no activity)
6. No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
7. 1-10% built up area coverage (edge location)
8. More than 80% un-constrained

Un-Allocated No SHLAA (Preset #85):
1. NOT SHLAA positive/neutral/negative (not assessed!)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m of settlement boundary
4. Company or private owner
5. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)

Strategy:
1. Identify edge-of-settlement sites
2. Secure option agreement (low capital)
3. Promote to local authority (planning consultancy)
4. Get allocated in local plan
5. Apply for planning permission
6. Exit to housebuilder

## Strategy Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern:

**Budget-Driven:**
- <£50k → Option Agreement, Airspace Rights
- £50k-£200k → Sub-£200k Direct, Derelict Turnaround
- £200k-£500k → Under-Developed + Accessibility, Stalled Planning
- >£500k → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Low risk → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations
- Medium risk → Stalled Planning, Under-Developed Sites
- High risk → Derelict Turnaround, Airspace Development

**Timeline:**
- Fast (<12 months) → Existing Approvals, Option Exercise
- Medium (12-24 months) → Stalled Planning Revival, Turnarounds
- Long (24+ months) → Greenfield Development, Strategic Allocations

**Expertise Required:**
- Low → Sub-£200k Direct Purchase, Simple Turnarounds
- Medium → Stalled Planning, Motivated Sellers
- High → Airspace Development, Tall Buildings, Strategic Sites

---

## Combining Patterns

### Example: "Mixed-Use 8-Storey £2M Profit on £200k Capital"

**Possible Approach Combinations:**

1. **Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A) + Motivated Seller (Pattern 2A)**
   - Find stalled mixed-use planning with corporate seller motivation
   - Low acquisition cost, planning precedent exists
   - Capital: option agreement or distressed purchase

2. **Under-Developed (Pattern 3A) + Airspace (Pattern 6A)**
   - High PTAL, flat roof, existing low-rise
   - Add 4-6 storeys of residential above
   - Capital: airspace rights + construction finance

3. **Derelict Turnaround (Pattern 4C) + Height Intensification (Pattern 5A)**
   - Derelict building in tall building zone
   - Demolish + rebuild to 8 storeys
   - Capital: acquisition + phased construction

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

# ADVANCED WORKFLOW

_This section contains meta-strategies that sit on top of the filter patterns._

**Note:** Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage) has been relocated here as it is a **workflow process** rather than a filter pattern. However, both Gemini and Codex agreed it is **one of the HIGHEST ROI strategies** (Codex ranked it #3). It acts as a **force multiplier** for any pattern you choose to monitor.

## 13. Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies ⭐ NEW

**Core Concept:** SearchLand refreshes data every 24 hours. Speed advantage = profit advantage.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)
- Time arbitrage = price arbitrage
```

### Pattern 13B: Fresh Planning Consent Alert
```
Strategy: Contact owner same day planning consent granted
Indicators:
- Planning status: Approved (filter)
- Decision date: Last 7 days (custom monitoring)
- Your action: Call owner immediately

Example Script:
"Congratulations on your consent. I have a buyer ready to move. 
Would £580k interest you?" (Owner unaware of £650k market value)

Profit: £70k in 48 hours (user example)

Strengths: Maximum information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires daily monitoring, fast response capability
Capital: Option agreement or cash purchase ready
```

### Pattern 13C: Lease Expiry Pre-Contact (90-Day Window)
```
Strategy: Contact owner 90 days before lease expiry (before void period)
Indicators:
- Lease end date: 60-120 days from today
- Use class: Commercial (E, B2, B8)
- Your offer: "Avoid void period, we have buyers ready"

Owner Psychology:
- 90 days out: Starting to worry about vacancy
- 30 days out: Panicking about lost income
- Post-expiry: Maximum pressure (carrying costs, no income)

Profit Source: Buy at "pre-panic" price, sell at market
```

### Pattern 13D: New Allocation Alert (Local Plan)
```
Strategy: Contact owner when site added to local plan allocations
Indicators:
- Housing allocation: Emerging (NEW)
- Applications in last 5 years: 0 (owner unaware)
- Your action: "Your site just got allocated—let's discuss before agent calls"

Example:
Day 1: SearchLand shows site added to emerging allocations
Day 1 (same day): You call owner offering £300k
Owner thinks: "My land was worth £150k yesterday, £300k is amazing!"
Reality: Market value post-allocation = £500k
Your profit: £200k by being first

Strengths: Massive information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires immediate action (speed critical)
```

### Pattern 13E: Fast Food Lease Expiry (High Visibility)
```
Strategy: Target high-footfall commercial with expiring leases
Indicators:
- Use class: E (restaurants/retail)
- Lease end date: Last 30 days (just expired)
- Footfall count: >2000/day (high value)
- Your action: Contact landlord (now in void period, cash flow pressure)

Why This Works:
- High footfall = high value but landlord may not realize
- Void period = immediate cash flow pressure
- Can offer "quick sale to avoid prolonged void"

Buyers: Fast food chains, convenience stores (high footfall valuable)
```

### Implementation Requirements

**System Setup:**
1. **Daily Automated Exports**
   - Export target filter results as CSV/JSON
   - Store with timestamp
   - Compare today vs yesterday (diff script)

2. **Alert Triggers**
   - New properties added: Email notification
   - Status changes: SMS + Email
   - Approaching thresholds (e.g., 90 days to lease expiry): Weekly digest

3. **Response Protocol**
   - Same-day contact for fresh consents
   - Script templates for different scenarios
   - Cash/option ready to move fast

**Tools Needed:**
- SearchLand API (or automated export)
- Diff comparison script (Python/Node)
- Email/SMS alerting system
- CRM for tracking contacts

### Capital Strategy

**Speed Capital:**
- Keep £50k-£200k liquid for immediate deployment
- Option agreements (£10k-£50k) for fast control
- Bridging finance arranged in advance (no delays)

**Profit Model:**
- Time arbitrage: Buy at "uninformed" price, sell at "informed" price
- Typical spread: 10-30% (£50k-£200k on £500k deal)
- Volume strategy: 10-20 deals/year = £500k-£2M profit

### Strengths
1. **Information asymmetry:** You know before owner/market
2. **No competition:** Pre-market, no agents, no bidders
3. **Premium pricing:** Buyers pay for exclusivity
4. **Scalable:** Automated monitoring, repeatable process
5. **High ROI:** Low capital, high profit margins

### Weaknesses
1. **Requires daily monitoring:** Labor-intensive or requires automation
2. **Speed critical:** Miss by 1 day = opportunity lost
3. **Competitive advantage erodes:** Once others adopt same strategy
4. **SearchLand dependency:** 24hr refresh only (not real-time)
5. **Execution risk:** Owner may not want to sell, buyer may back out

### Example Deal Flow

**Day 1 Morning:**
- SearchLand export shows planning consent granted yesterday
- Property: 4-unit scheme, Camden, owner-occupied

**Day 1 Afternoon:**
- Call owner: "Congratulations! I have a buyer at £580k, quick completion"
- Owner (unaware of £650k market value): "Yes, that sounds great!"

**Day 2:**
- Option agreement signed (£10k, 30-day exercise)
- Call buyer network: "Fresh consent, Camden, 4 units, £650k"
- Buyer: "Pre-vetted, no competition? Yes."

**Day 3-30:**
- Due diligence, legal, exercise option
- Completion: You buy £580k, sell £650k
- **Net profit: £60k** (after legals/costs)

**Annualized: 10 deals = £600k profit from speed arbitrage alone**

---

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### ❌ Over-Constraining
```
Problem: Combining too many restrictive filters
Example: Applications = 0 AND Price <£200k AND Derelict AND On-market AND PTAL 6a
Result: 0 results (filters compound restrictiveness)
Solution: Test incrementally, use separate filter groups for different approaches
```

### ❌ Geographic Mismatches
```
Problem: Using London-specific filters (PTAL) for UK-wide searches
Example: PTAL filter outside TfL area
Result: 0 results
Solution: Create separate approaches for London vs rest of UK
```

### ❌ Assuming Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem: Designing strategy around filters that don't exist
Example: "Planning Status: Expired" or "Price Reduced"
Result: Cannot implement strategy
Solution: Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md first
```

- **Rooftop:** Target high-energy users (manufacturing, warehousing)
- **Owner-occupied:** Easier than landlord/tenant (split incentive)
- **SIC code targeting:** Paper, poultry, manufacturing = high energy bills

**Strategic Insights - Other Renewable:**
- **Substation proximity CRITICAL:** <2km for solar/wind/BESS, <200m for hydrogen
- **Green rated substation:** Must have capacity (grid connection expensive if not)
- **Safety buffers:** Hydrogen >500m from schools/hospitals/care homes
- **Scale:** All require large capital (institutional investors)

### Category 4: Regulation-Driven Opportunities - 6 Presets

**Strategy:** Regulation forces owner action (motivates sale)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 12 | HMO expired licenses | HMO license expired | Cannot operate legally | £100k-£400k |
| 17 | Commercial expiring leases | Lease ends <2027, B2/B8/E, stale | Income cliff approaching | £200k-£1M+ |
| 41 | Fast food expired leases | E(b) food/drink, lease expired | Income ended | £100k-£500k |
| 46 | High footfall lease expiry | 6k+ footfall, lease 6-12m | Prime location, motivated | £500k-£3M+ |
| 66 | Office blocks expiring | E(g) offices, lease <2026 | Income ending | £300k-£2M+ |
| 78 | Single flats expiring leases | C3 flat, lease <2099, 1 address | Lease running out | £50k-£300k |

**Additional EPC-Related (implicit regulation):**

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2 | Run down homes | EPC E/F/G, detached, <30% developed | Cannot rent legally | £100k-£400k |
| 20 | Unsold poor EPC | EPC E/F/G, sold before 2004 (20+ years!) | Cannot rent + tired owner | £50k-£300k |
| 36 | ECO4 | EPC E/F/G, 5+ addresses, private owner | Grant-eligible improvements | £200k-£1M |
| 47 | HMO opportunities | 8-12 rooms, low EPC, sold before 2014 | Conversion + improvement needed | £150k-£500k |
| 67 | Offices low EPC | EPC D/E/F/G, E commercial, office type | High energy costs | £200k-£1M+ |
| 69 | Older houses outdoor space | No sold date, low EPC, no apps 5 years | Legacy holding + cannot rent | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **HMO licenses:** Expired = illegal to operate → forced renewal (£1k-£3k) or sale
- **Lease expiry:** 6-12 months = peak motivation (owner deciding)
- **Vacant post-expiry:** Strongest signal (no income, carrying costs)
- **EPC E-G:** Cannot rent in private sector since 2020 → improvement (£5k-£50k) or sale
- **Combine signals:** E.g., expired HMO license + low EPC = double motivation

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A-8C

### Category 5: Green Belt Strategies - 5 Presets

**Strategy:** Exploit "previously developed" and edge-of-settlement exceptions

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategic Rationale | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| 7 | Grey Belt | 25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding, GB, <100m built-up | Previously developed exception | £50k-£300k |
| 43 | GB sites with hardstanding | 1%+ GB, 1k-10k sqmt, built-up or <100m | Edge + previous development | £50k-£300k |
| 44 | Grey Belt low GB review | GB Review score 1-2, 25%+ hardstanding, <100m built-up | Low environmental impact | £50k-£300k |
| 45 | Ground-mounted solar GB | Proposal "ground mounted" + "solar", GB | Renewable energy exception | £500k-£5M |
| 57 | Storage in Green Belt | Built-up, B2/B8, 0-20% developed, NOT GB (!?) | Note: Preset name misleading | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Previously developed land:** >10-30% hardstanding = brownfield status
- **Hardstanding = proxy:** Concrete/asphalt from demolished buildings, car parks
- **Edge of settlement:** <100m from built-up = less "green" objection
- **Green Belt Review scores:** 1-2 = low landscape/environmental value
- **Planning still required:** These are exceptions, not guarantees
- **Less competition:** Many developers avoid GB entirely (opportunity)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A-9B

| 26 | Allocated 5-50 acres | 20k-200k sqmt, employment allocation, <100m A/B road | Strategic employment land | £1M+ per acre |
| 38 | Emerging sites no planning | Emerging allocation, <1 app, 4k-40k sqmt | First mover advantage | £10k-£50k option |
| 63 | Planning 10-100 units | 8k+ sqmt, 10-100 dwellings applied, in settlement | Existing planning | £500k-£5M |
| 75 | Residential allocations | 4k-40k sqmt, housing/mixed allocation, private | Policy-backed sites | £100k-£1M+ |
| 85 | Un-allocated no SHLAA 1-10 acres | NOT SHLAA, NOT allocated, <50m settlement, 4k-40k sqmt | Hidden gems to promote | £10k-£50k option |
| 86 | Un-allocated private 4k+ sqmt | Private, 4k+ sqmt, NOT allocated, <200m settlement | Edge promotion | £10k-£50k option |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Emerging allocations (#38):** Allocated but no planning yet = first mover advantage
- **No SHLAA (#85, #86):** Not assessed by authority = hidden opportunity to promote
- **Edge of settlement:** <50-200m from boundary = natural expansion direction
- **"No latest sold date":** Never sold = inherited/legacy (may not know value)
- **Option agreements:** Low capital (£10k-£50k), control site, promote to LA
- **Timelines:** 2-5 years for allocation → planning → sale
- **Planning expertise:** Essential for promotion strategies

## Key Strategic Learnings from Presets

### 1. Motivation Signals (NEW - from Preset Analysis)

**Regulation-Driven (Strongest):**
- ⚠️ HMO License Expiry Date (cannot operate)
- ⚠️ Lease end date (income cliff)
- ⚠️ EPC E-G rating (cannot rent)

**Time-Based:**
- No latest sold date (never sold = legacy)
- Latest sold date >20 years ago
- <1 application in last 5 years (no activity)

**Corporate:**
- Company status: Liquidation (from user discovery)
- 30+ titles owned (portfolio divestment)

### 2. Previously Undocumented Filters

**From Preset Analysis:**
- `Hardstanding percentage` (proxy for previously developed)
- `Agricultural Land Grade` (energy project viability)
- `SHLAA status` (strategic land indicator)
- `Green Belt Review score` (environmental impact)
- `SIC codes` (industry targeting)
- `Average daily footfall` (commercial viability)
- `Average daily vehicle count` (traffic-dependent viability)
- `Distance to green rated substation` (energy projects)
- `EPC recommendations contains "solar"` (improvement suggestions)

### 3. Clever Filter Combinations

**ANY Logic (Accessibility):**
Preset #10 (Padel):
```
Within 400m of bus stop OR
Within 800m of train station OR
Within 5m of built up area
```
→ Flexible accessibility requirements

**Compound Targeting:**
Preset #7 (Grey Belt):
```
Green Belt location +
25%+ developed +
10%+ hardstanding +
Within 100m built-up +
NOT: [long list of absolute constraints]
```
→ Multiple signals = "previously developed in GB"

**Strategic Constraint Targeting:**
Preset #13 (Edge of Settlement):
```
1-99% green belt coverage OR
1-99% another constraint coverage
```
→ Targets edge cases (partially constrained = opportunity)

### 4. Threshold Insights

**Commercial Viability:**
- 800+ footfall = Viable cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = Prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = Viable petrol/drive-thru/EV

**Energy Projects:**
- <2,000m substation = Solar/wind/BESS viable
- <200m substation = Hydrogen viable (high power)
- <5,000m substation = EV charging viable

**Size Thresholds:**
- Class MA: <4,000 sqmt title
- Class G: <250 sqmt (only 2 flats)
- Solar ground mount: >40,000 sqmt (10 acres min)
- BESS: 20,000-400,000 sqmt (5-100 acres)

**Hardstanding (Previously Developed):**
- 10%+ = Minimal indicator
- 25-30%+ = Clear previously developed
- 40%+ = Significant (car parks)
