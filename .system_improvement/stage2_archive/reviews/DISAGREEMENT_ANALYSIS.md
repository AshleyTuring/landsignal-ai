Now I'll analyze these three reviews for significant disagreements:

```
DISAGREEMENT ANALYSIS:

Total Patterns Reviewed: 21 (13 original + 8 from peer review)
Reviewers: Gemini, Codex, Grok
Significant Disagreements Found: 3

---

### Disagreement 1: Pattern Ranking Priorities

**Gemini Position:** Pattern 8 (Regulation-Driven) ranked #1, Pattern 13 (Time Arbitrage) ranked #2
**Codex Position:** Pattern 8 (Regulation-Driven) ranked #1, Pattern 13 (Time Arbitrage) ranked #2
**Grok Position:** Pattern 13 (Time Arbitrage) ranked #1, Pattern 8 (Regulation-Driven) ranked #2

**Conflict:** Grok believes time arbitrage is the single highest ROI pattern as a "force multiplier," while both Gemini and Codex prioritize regulation-driven opportunities for their predictability and legal compulsion. This is a **fundamental strategic difference** in what creates the most value.

**Requires Iteration:** NO - This reflects different but valid strategic philosophies (speed vs. certainty). Both positions are defensible.

### Disagreement 2: Pattern 4 (Low Capital Entry) Usefulness

**Gemini Position:** "Highly Useful" - Essential for users without institutional funding, explicitly recommends airspace and option strategies
**Codex Position:** "Limited Use" - Only Pattern C worth running, would "ignore the rest until clearer filters provided"
**Grok Position:** "Highly Useful" - Critical for capital-constrained buyers, Pattern B (options) particularly valuable

**Conflict:** Codex fundamentally questions the executability of this pattern due to missing preset references and vague filters, rating it as nearly unusable. Gemini and Grok see it as essential despite acknowledging similar weaknesses.

**Requires Iteration:** YES - Codex has identified a critical gap: the pattern lacks actionable filter specifications. If 2/3 reviewers say "highly useful" but 1/3 says "limited use - don't run it," this needs resolution on execution detail vs. strategic intent.

### Disagreement 3: Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry) - Categorization

**Gemini Position:** Pattern 8 (Regulation-Driven) is "exemplary," no weaknesses mentioned. Lease expiry correctly belongs here.
**Codex Position:** "Lease expiry opportunities really belong under Pattern 2 because the driver is behavioural, not regulatory—mixing them here dilutes the category purpose."
**Grok Position:** No objection raised; treats Pattern 8 as cohesive.

**Conflict:** Codex argues for a fundamental reorganization of Pattern 8 to separate regulatory compliance triggers (HMO, EPC) from behavioral motivations (lease expiry). This is a **structural categorization disagreement** about what "regulation-driven" means.

**Requires Iteration:** NO - This is an organizational preference, not a factual conflict. Lease expiry can logically fit in either category depending on framing (regulatory time pressure vs. behavioral motivation).

### Disagreement 4: Overall Document Grade & Confidence

**Gemini Position:** Grade A-, Confidence HIGH, Would use DAILY
**Codex Position:** Grade B-, Confidence MEDIUM, Would use WITH CHANGES (needs structural fixes first)
**Grok Position:** Grade A-, Confidence HIGH, Would use (with improvements)

**Conflict:** Codex is notably more critical about **immediate usability** due to structural issues (missing Pattern 11 header, broken cross-references, outdated Round Guide). Gemini and Grok acknowledge the same issues but consider them minor obstacles to an otherwise excellent resource.

**Requires Iteration:** NO - This reflects different tolerance for structural imperfections. Codex prioritizes execution precision; Gemini/Grok prioritize strategic comprehensiveness.

RECOMMENDATION: **PROCEED TO SYNTHESIS**

**Rationale:**
- Only **1 disagreement requires iteration** (Pattern 4 executability)
- The other conflicts are **valid differences in strategic philosophy** or **organizational preferences**
- All three reviewers agree the patterns are fundamentally sound
- The structural issues Codex raises are unanimously acknowledged and can be addressed in synthesis
- Pattern 4 can be resolved by adding the preset references and filter snapshots that **all three reviewers request** in Part 3

**Key Synthesis Priorities:**
1. Add actionable filter snippets to Pattern 4 (addresses Codex's "limited use" critique)
2. Restore Pattern 11 header and fix navigation (Codex's structural fix, acknowledged by all)
3. Clarify Pattern 8B categorization in documentation (acknowledge dual nature)
4. Synthesize new patterns proposed by all three (HMO Conversion, Unbroken Freehold both appear twice)
