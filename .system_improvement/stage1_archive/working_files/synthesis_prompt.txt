# SYNTHESIS TASK: Integrate Peer Reviews into FILTER_PATTERNS.md

You are Claude, the original author of FILTER_PATTERNS.md. You've received peer reviews from Gemini and Codex.

## YOUR TASK

Synthesize their feedback and create an IMPROVED version of FILTER_PATTERNS.md.

### Decision-Making Process:

**For Critiques of Existing Patterns:**
1. If BOTH Gemini & Codex agree on an improvement → Implement it
2. If ONE suggests improvement and other is neutral → Implement if logical
3. If they DISAGREE → Use your judgment, explain decision

**For New Pattern Suggestions:**
1. If BOTH suggest similar pattern → Definitely add it
2. If ONE suggests and it's strong → Add it
3. If pattern overlaps with existing → Merge or explain why separate

**For Structure Changes:**
1. Prioritize changes that help ALL agents
2. Add navigational aids (tags, decision trees, round guides)
3. Keep what works, improve what doesn't

### Output Format:

```markdown
# FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.0 (Post-Peer Review)

[Updated version of FILTER_PATTERNS.md incorporating all accepted feedback]
```

AND separately:

### Critical Rules:

1. **Be Honest About Trade-offs**
   - If simplifying for Gemini complicates for Codex, acknowledge it
   - Document why you chose one approach over another

2. **Maintain Pattern Quality**
   - Don't add patterns just to please reviewers
   - Ensure new patterns are truly reusable (not one-off)
   - Keep strategic rationale clear

3. **Improve Usability for ALL**
   - If Gemini wants tags and Codex wants decision trees → Add both
   - If one wants more detail and other wants brevity → Use collapsible sections
   - Optimize for collaborative workflow (all agents use same doc)

4. **Update Cross-References**
   - If patterns change, update PRESET_STRATEGY_GUIDE.md links
   - Update Requirements template if pattern organization changes
   - Update orchestrate_collaborative.sh if round guidance added

5. **Version Control**
   - Clearly mark as v2.0
   - Keep changelog of what changed
   - Note in header: "Post-Peer Review (Gemini & Codex)"

**Review Completeness:** 5/5 parts completed

## PART 1: CRITIQUE OF EXISTING PATTERNS

### **Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Good identification of two distinct sub-patterns (date-based vs. keyword-based).
- Correctly identifies that a direct "expired" filter doesn't exist and provides a solid proxy.

**Weaknesses:**
- The indicators are too simple. They miss key motivation signals. For example, why did it stall? Combining with ownership type (e.g., `Company`) or a long hold period (`Latest sold date`) would strengthen this.
- "Building on title is inactive" is a good start, but `Derelict` is a much stronger signal of distress and should be mentioned as a more potent alternative.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add `Ownership type: Company` and `Latest sold date: >5 years ago` as optional indicators to find stalled projects held by potentially impatient corporate owners.
- Explicitly state that `Building on title is derelict: Yes` is a stronger indicator than `inactive`.
- Add a note to cross-reference with Pattern 2 (Motivated Seller) as these strategies are often intertwined.

**Your Usage:** I would use this, but always in combination with other motivation filters. A stalled application on its own isn't enough; I need to know *why* it stalled and if the owner is now motivated to sell.

---

### **Pattern 2: Motivated Seller Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Excellent identification of multiple motivation angles: corporate distress (2A), market fatigue (2B), and development rationale (2C).
- The new Pattern 2D (Liquidation/Administration) is a superb, high-value addition. It targets a clear, legally-enforced motivation. This is a top-tier strategy.

**Weaknesses:**
- Pattern 2B is weak because SearchLand lacks a "time on market" filter. It's more of a manual review strategy than a filter strategy. This should be clarified.
- Pattern 2C's logic is slightly flawed; transport proximity doesn't directly signal motivation. It signals *value*, which should be combined with a true motivation signal like `Building on title is derelict: Yes`. The current description conflates the two.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- **Pattern 2B:** Re-label as "Manual Review of Stale Listings" and clarify that it's not a direct filtering strategy.
- **Pattern 2C:** Rephrase to "Derelict Assets with High Redevelopment Value". The core is the dereliction (motivation), and the transport link is the value-add.
- Add a new sub-pattern based on `No latest sold date` (from Presets #18, #69), which targets inherited/legacy holdings where owners may be unaware of the asset's true value and are often motivated to sell.

**Your Usage:** Yes, especially 2A and 2D. These are actionable, filter-based strategies that target genuine, verifiable seller motivation. They lead to off-market and below-market opportunities.

---

### **Pattern 3: Development Opportunity Strategies**

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Covers the main types of development opportunities: intensification (3A), clean slate (3B), and value-add (3C).

**Weaknesses:**
- The indicators are too generic. "Title area: appropriate size" is not a useful indicator. It should provide concrete ranges sourced from the presets (e.g., `>0.5 acres` or `4,000-8,000 sqmt`).
- Lacks specificity. For example, Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + High Accessibility) is a classic London strategy but doesn't explicitly mention using `PTAL` as the primary filter.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Replace "appropriate size" with specific area ranges (in acres and sqmt) derived from presets like #5 (1-2 acres) or #9 (500-8,000 sqmt).
- **Pattern 3A:** Explicitly state this is a PTAL-driven strategy for London and a "Distance to Train Station" strategy elsewhere.
- **Pattern 3B:** Add `Use class: Vacant/derelict land` or `Unused land` (from Preset #9) as a key indicator for "clean slate" development.

**Your Usage:** I would use these as starting points, but they require significant refinement with specific metrics to be effective. They are more like conceptual guides than ready-to-use patterns.

---

### **Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the three main low-capital routes: direct purchase (4A), options (4B), and distressed assets (4C).
- Pattern 4B (Option Agreements) rightly points out that the `Sales listing price` filter is NOT required, targeting off-market deals. This is a crucial insight.

**Weaknesses:**
- Pattern 4A (Sub-£200k) is highly restrictive and often yields poor quality sites. The "Weaknesses" section is accurate but could be stronger – it's a needle-in-a-haystack search.
- The capital requirements are a bit generic. They could be linked to specific deal types (e.g., "Option fees for a £1M site are typically £10k-£20k").

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add `Airspace Rights` (Pattern 6) as a fourth low-capital entry strategy, as the initial capital outlay is for the rights, not the entire building.
- For Pattern 4B, add `No latest sold date` as another indicator for finding owners who might be open to creative deals like options.

**Your Usage:** Yes, absolutely. Pattern 4B is the cornerstone of many a developer's portfolio. Pattern 4C is my preferred route for finding value. Pattern 4A is a last resort.

---

### **Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Good breakdown of policy-led (5A), planning-led (5B), and allocation-led (5C) intensification.

**Weaknesses:**
- Pattern 5A is missing the critical manual research step. There is no "Tall Building Zone" filter. The pattern implies you can filter for this, which is dangerously misleading.
- Pattern 5C (Strategic Site Allocation) is too vague. It should reference specific allocation types like `Housing allocation (emerging)` from the `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- **Pattern 5A:** Add a prominent `Manual Research Required` warning. State that the user must first identify tall building zones from local planning policy documents and then search within those LPAs.
- **Pattern 5C:** Replace `[specific allocation]` with concrete examples from the `AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md` file, such as `Site allocation type: is one of Housing allocation, Mixed allocation, Employment allocation`.

**Your Usage:** I would use 5B and 5C as they are based on verifiable data within SearchLand. I would use 5A with extreme caution, as it requires significant off-platform research to be viable.

---

### **Pattern 6: Airspace Development Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Excellent use of the `A building in the title has flat roof: Yes` filter.
- Correctly identifies the two main airspace plays: residential on residential (6A) and residential on commercial (6B).
- The link to PDR in 6B is a sophisticated and valuable insight.

**Weaknesses:**
- Could be strengthened by referencing the specific Airspace presets (#22, #23, #24, #25) to provide more concrete filter examples, such as targeting `8 or more addresses` or `Unbroken freeholds` (<1 leasehold).

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add a sub-section "Sourced From Presets" and list the criteria from Presets #22 (8+ addresses), #23 (Commercial, no resi), and #25 (Unbroken freeholds) as example implementations. This makes the pattern much more actionable.

**Your Usage:** Yes. This is a key urban development strategy, and the pattern correctly identifies the core filters needed to find opportunities.

---

### **Pattern 7: Permitted Development Rights (PDR) Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- This is a fantastic, well-researched addition. It correctly extracts the most valuable PDR strategies directly from the presets.
- The inclusion of source presets (#4, #6, #31, #8) is excellent practice and should be replicated elsewhere.
- The breakdown into Class MA, Q, G, and Infill is logical and covers the main opportunities.

**Weaknesses:**
- The "Profit calculation" for Class MA is specific to Preset #4 and might not apply if building the filter from scratch. This should be clarified.
- Pattern 7D (Infill) is based on a "pre-calculated" preset. The pattern should explain how a user could *approximate* this themselves, e.g., by using `C3 dwellinghouses`, `<15% area developed`, and `Private owner ownership` (from Preset #16/69).

**Suggested Improvements:**
- For Pattern 7A, add a note: "The automatic profit calculation is a feature of Preset #4. Manual calculation is required if building this filter from scratch."
- For Pattern 7D, add a "Manual Approximation" section with filters like `Use class: C3`, `Developed area percentage: <20%`, `Title area (acres): >0.2` to find potential infill sites without relying on the pre-calculated preset.

**Your Usage:** Absolutely. These are bread-and-butter strategies for small to medium-sized developers. The regulatory shortcut is the primary value driver.

---

### **Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Another outstanding, high-value addition based on deep preset analysis.
- Identifies three of the most powerful, non-obvious motivation signals in SearchLand: HMO license expiry, lease expiry, and EPC non-compliance.
- The "Motivation Logic" and "Motivation Timeline" sections are superb, explaining the *why* behind the strategy.

**Weaknesses:**
- No significant weaknesses. This section is a model for how other patterns should be structured.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Under Pattern 8C (EPC), add a note about combining this with `No latest sold date` (from Preset #69) to find long-held, poorly-maintained properties that are prime for this strategy.

**Your Usage:** Yes, 100%. These are the "alpha" strategies. They find motivated sellers based on external pressures that are invisible to most market participants. Pattern 8A (HMOs) is particularly potent due to its time-sensitive and legal nature.

---

### **Pattern 9: Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Excellent explanation of the "Grey Belt" concept, a sophisticated planning strategy.
- Correctly identifies `Hardstanding percentage` as the key proxy filter for "previously developed land". This is a critical, non-obvious insight from the presets.
- Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement) is a brilliant distillation of the land promotion strategy shown in presets like #18 and #85.

**Weaknesses:**
- The term "Green Belt Workaround" is a bit aggressive. "Green Belt Exceptions" or "Green Belt Strategies" would be more professional.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Rename the category to "Green Belt & Strategic Land Strategies".
- In Pattern 9B, explicitly mention using `SHLAA status: is not one of Positive, Neutral, Negative` (from Preset #85) to find sites that haven't even been assessed by the council yet, representing a true "hidden gem".

**Your Usage:** Yes. These are advanced strategies for experienced developers and land promoters. Pattern 9A can unlock sites that others dismiss, and 9B is the core of long-term strategic land promotion.

---

### **Pattern 10: Renewable Energy Opportunities**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful (for a niche audience)  

**Strengths:**
- A comprehensive and well-structured guide to a very specialized field.
- Correctly identifies the critical filters: `Agricultural Land Grade` (avoiding Grade 1-2), `Distance to green rated substation`, and safety buffers for hydrogen.
- The use of `SIC codes` for targeting high-energy industries (Pattern 10B) is a very advanced and effective technique.

**Weaknesses:**
- The capital requirements are huge, making these patterns irrelevant for most users. This should be stated upfront.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add an introductory sentence: "Note: These are institutional-scale, high-capital strategies (£500k - £50M+) primarily for energy companies, funds, or specialist developers."
- For Pattern 10B, highlight that this is an *outreach* strategy. You're not buying the site, you're selling a solar installation service to the owner. This is a different business model.

**Your Usage:** As an analyst, this is invaluable for advising energy clients. As a typical property developer, I would likely never use these directly unless I had a specific mandate and institutional backing.

---

### **Pattern 11: Strategic Land Promotion**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Incomplete (overlaps with 9B)  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**
- Correctly identifies the "first mover" advantage of targeting emerging allocations with no planning yet (Pattern 11A).

**Weaknesses:**
- This pattern category feels redundant. Pattern 11A is very similar to Pattern 9B. They are both about promoting land for allocation. They should be merged or more clearly differentiated.
- Pattern 11B is a good, distinct strategy for large employment land.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- **Merge Pattern 11A into 9B.** Rename Pattern 9 to "Strategic Land & Green Belt" and have two sub-patterns: 9A (Grey Belt) and 9B (Land Promotion), where 9B combines the insights from the current 9B and 11A.
- Keep Pattern 11B but move it under the new merged category, perhaps as "Pattern 9C: Strategic Employment Land".

**Your Usage:** Yes, but I find the current structure confusing. I would use the merged structure I've proposed.

---

### **Pattern 12: Commercial Traffic-Dependent**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful (for commercial/retail clients)  

**Strengths:**
- Excellent use of the data-driven filters `Average daily footfall` and `Average daily vehicle count`.
- Provides clear, quantified viability thresholds (e.g., 800+ footfall for a cafe, 10,000+ vehicles for a drive-thru). This is extremely valuable.
- The breakdown into footfall, vehicle traffic, and niche markets is logical.

**Weaknesses:**
- No significant weaknesses. This is another well-executed pattern derived from preset analysis.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- In Pattern 12B, add a note about combining this with `Lease end date` filters. An expiring lease on a high-traffic site is a prime opportunity.

**Your Usage:** Yes, constantly for my retail and commercial clients. This is how you make data-driven decisions in the commercial property sector, moving beyond guesswork.

---

### **Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful (conceptually)  

**Strengths:**
- This is a brilliant, high-level strategic concept. It correctly identifies that the 24-hour refresh cycle of SearchLand creates a window of opportunity.
- The examples (Fresh Planning Consent, Lease Expiry Pre-Contact) are concrete and illustrate the value of speed.

**Weaknesses:**
- This is not a *filter* pattern. It's a *workflow* or *process* that sits on top of other filter patterns. It requires external automation (scripts, alerts) that are outside the scope of SearchLand itself.
- It's presented as a pattern, but it's really a meta-strategy for *how to use* the other patterns.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- **Move this entire section.** Create a new top-level section in the document called "Advanced Workflow: Time & Information Arbitrage" or move it into the "Structure & Usability" part of the review. It doesn't belong in the list of filter patterns.
- Reframe it as a "how-to" guide for setting up a monitoring system that leverages the other patterns.

**Your Usage:** I would use this *process* every single day. But I wouldn't look for it in a list of *filter patterns*. The concept is A-grade, but its placement is confusing.

---

## PART 2: NEW PATTERNS PROPOSED

### **NEW PATTERN: Legacy Holdings (Inherited & Untouched)**

**Category:** Motivated Seller Strategies

**Strategic Rationale:**
This pattern targets properties that have likely been inherited or held by the same owner for decades, before digital records were common. These owners are often elderly, non-professional, and may be unaware of the property's current development potential or market value. They can be highly motivated to sell for estate planning, to release equity, or to offload a burdensome asset. This is a distinct motivation from corporate or regulatory pressure.

**Key Filters:**
1. `No latest sold date`: is equal to Yes (The single most important filter)
2. `Ownership type`: is equal to Private owner
3. `Less than 1 application in last 5 years`: is equal to Yes (Confirms no recent activity)
4. `EPC rating`: is one of E, F, G (Optional but strong signal of a poorly maintained, un-rentable asset)
5. `Title area (acres)`: is greater than 0.5 (Optional, to target larger plots with infill potential)

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #18 (Edge of settlement sites)
- Preset #69 (Older houses with outdoor space)
- General property knowledge (finding "tired landlords" and inherited properties)

**Use Cases:**
- Finding off-market sites for infill development.
- Approaching elderly owners for option agreements.
- Acquiring properties below market value from non-professional sellers.

**Expected Results:**
- Low volume of results, but each one is a high-potential lead.
- Excellent for patient, relationship-based sourcing.

---

### **NEW PATTERN: Portfolio Divestment Candidate**

**Category:** Motivated Seller Strategies

**Strategic Rationale:**
This pattern identifies large, professional landlords (companies) who own multiple properties, often including underperforming assets like those with expiring HMO licenses or numerous vacant units. The strategy is to find signals that a portfolio owner might be looking to divest specific, problematic assets. This is different from a single-asset owner.

**Key Filters:**
1. `Number of titles owned by company`: is greater than 30 (Targets large portfolio holders)
2. `Ownership type`: is equal to Company
3. `Currently has HMO`: is equal to Yes (Narrows to HMO landlords)
4. `HMO License Expiry Date`: is before [today's date] (Finds the problematic asset in their portfolio)

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #35 (Companies owning more than 30 titles)
- Combination of Pattern 8A (HMOs) and corporate ownership filters.

**Use Cases:**
- Approaching large landlords to acquire their expired-license HMOs.
- Identifying professional sellers who may be willing to offload multiple assets at once.
- Targeting portfolios for bulk acquisition.

**Expected Results:**
- A highly targeted list of professional landlords with a clear reason to sell a specific asset.

---

### **NEW PATTERN: Brownfield Demolition & Rebuild**

**Category:** Development Opportunity Strategies

**Strategic Rationale:**
This pattern specifically targets "brownfield" sites where a building likely existed but has been demolished, leaving behind hardstanding but low developed area. This is a distinct opportunity from "vacant land" (which may be greenfield) and "derelict buildings" (where demolition is still required). It finds sites that are primed for a new build with less site-clearing cost and a clear "previously developed" planning argument.

**Key Filters:**
1. `Developed area percentage`: is less than 10% (No significant buildings remain)
2. `Hardstanding percentage`: is greater than 30% (Confirms a previous structure/use)
3. `Use class`: is one of `E(g)(iii) industrial processes`, `B2`, `B8` (Targets former industrial sites)
4. `Title area (acres)`: is between 0.25 and 3 (Typical size for small-medium industrial plots)

**Sourced From:**
- Preset #15 (Brownfield - industrial)
- Analysis of the relationship between `Developed area %` and `Hardstanding %` in the `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`.

**Use Cases:**
- Finding clean, ready-to-build industrial or residential plots.
- Leveraging "previously developed land" status in planning applications.
- Avoiding demolition costs and risks associated with derelict buildings.

**Expected Results:**
- A small number of sites that are perfect for ground-up development.

---

## PART 3: STRUCTURE & USABILITY

### **Structural Improvement: Create a Master Strategy Matrix**

**Current Problem:**
The current list is a flat hierarchy of 13 patterns. It's hard to quickly decide which pattern to use based on project goals like capital, risk, or timeline. The "Strategy Selection Guide" at the end is a good start but is disconnected from the patterns themselves.

**Proposed Solution:**
Create a master matrix or table at the very top of the document that maps every pattern to key strategic axes. This allows an agent to find the right patterns in seconds.

**Example (mockup):**
```markdown
## Master Strategy Matrix

| Pattern # | Pattern Name | Primary Goal | Capital Level | Risk Level | Timeline | Key Filter Signal |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Stalled Planning | Value-Add | Medium | Medium | 12-24m | `Last application submitted` |
| 2D | Liquidation Sales | Below Market | Low-Medium | Low | <6m | `Company status: Liquidation` |
| 4B | Option Agreements | Low Capital Entry | Very Low | Medium | 24-36m | `Latest sold date >5yrs` |
| 7A | Class MA (PDR) | Speed / Low Risk | Medium | Low | 6-12m | `Use class: E` |
| 8A | HMO Expired License | Forced Seller | Medium | Low | <6m | `HMO License Expiry Date` |
| 9A | Grey Belt | Unlock Land | Low-Medium | High | 24-48m | `Hardstanding percentage` |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

**Benefit:**
This provides an at-a-glance decision-making tool. An agent with a "Low Capital" requirement can immediately see that Patterns 4B, 2D, and 6 are their best starting points. It makes the entire document instantly more usable.

---

### **Structural Improvement: Add Actionable Filter Snippets**

**Current Problem:**
The patterns describe the filters conceptually but don't provide copy-paste-ready examples. An agent still has to manually translate "Long Corporate Hold + Derelict Asset" into the correct filter syntax from `LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md`. This is inefficient and error-prone.

**Proposed Solution:**
For each pattern, add a collapsible "Example Filter Snippet" in a format that could be easily parsed or copied, like JSON or a simple key-value list.

**Example:**
````markdown
### Pattern 2A: Long Corporate Hold + Derelict Asset

... [existing description] ...

<details>
<summary>Example Filter Snippet</summary>

```json
{
  "group_operator": "AND",
  "filters": [
    { "filter": "Ownership type", "operator": "is equal to", "value": "Company" },
    { "filter": "Latest sold date", "operator": "is before", "value": "2020-11-20" },
    { "filter": "Building on title is derelict", "operator": "is equal to", "value": "Yes" }
  ]
}
```
</details>
````

**Benefit:**
This makes the patterns immediately actionable. It reduces ambiguity, prevents syntax errors (like using "sqm" instead of "acres"), and speeds up the entire workflow from strategy selection to execution.

---

### **Structural Improvement: Reorganize Categories & Relocate Pattern 13**

**Current Problem:**
The categories are a mix of strategy types (e.g., Motivated Seller) and development outcomes (e.g., Airspace). Pattern 13 (Time Arbitrage) is a workflow, not a filter pattern, and its inclusion in the list is confusing.

**Proposed Solution:**
1.  **Reorganize Categories:** Group patterns by their core strategic driver.
    *   **Motivation-Driven:** (Patterns 2, 8, and my new "Legacy Holdings" pattern). These are about *why* someone would sell.
    *   **Value-Add/Development:** (Patterns 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and my new "Brownfield" pattern). These are about *what* you can do with the site.
    *   **Low Capital:** (Pattern 4).
    *   **Niche & Specialist:** (Patterns 10, 12).
2.  **Relocate Pattern 13:** Move the "Time/Information Arbitrage" content out of the pattern list and into a new, top-level section called "Advanced Workflow: Real-Time Monitoring". This correctly frames it as a process that uses the other patterns.

**Benefit:**
This creates a more logical, intuitive structure. Agents can first decide on their primary driver (e.g., "I need to find a motivated seller") and then look at the relevant patterns, rather than scanning a disorganized list.

## PART 4: PATTERN RANKING

| Rank | Pattern # | Pattern Name | Why This Ranking? |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 8 | Regulation-Driven | Most potent. Targets non-obvious, legally-enforced motivation (HMO, EPC, Lease). Generates high-quality, off-market leads. |
| 2 | 2 | Motivated Seller | The core of value investing in property. Pattern 2D (Liquidation) is especially powerful. |
| 3 | 9 | Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds | Advanced, high-upside strategies. Unlocks value where others see none. "Grey Belt" is a game-changer. |
| 4 | 7 | Permitted Development (PDR) | De-risks the planning process, offering speed and certainty. A reliable strategy for smaller developers. |
| 5 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | Essential for most developers. Pattern 4B (Options) provides access to larger deals than capital would otherwise allow. |
| 6 | 6 | Airspace Development | A clever, capital-efficient urban intensification strategy. High ROI potential. |
| 7 | 12 | Commercial Traffic-Dependent | The definitive way to source and validate commercial sites. Data-driven and objective. |
| 8 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | A classic strategy. Useful, but requires combination with motivation signals to be truly effective. |
| 9 | 3 | Development Opportunity | Too generic on its own. A good conceptual starting point but needs significant refinement to be actionable. |
| 10 | 13 | Time/Information Arbitrage | Conceptually brilliant, but it's a *process*, not a filter pattern. Its value depends on implementing an external system. |
| 11 | 5 | High-Density/Intensification | Useful but often requires significant capital and planning expertise. Pattern 5A is misleading without manual research. |
| 12 | 11 | Strategic Land Promotion | Redundant with Pattern 9B. A valid but niche, long-term strategy that is better captured elsewhere. |
| 13 | 10 | Renewable Energy | Extremely niche, institutional-scale strategies. Irrelevant for 99% of typical property development users. |

**Real-World Test:**
"If you were given the MixedUse-8Storey-2M project requirements RIGHT NOW, which patterns would you reference and why?"

I would immediately reference and combine the following patterns:

1.  **Pattern 5A (Low-Rise in Tall Building Zone) + Pattern 3A (Under-Developed + High Accessibility):** My first approach would be to find an under-developed, low-rise building (e.g., 2-3 storeys) in a location with high transport accessibility (`PTAL: 4-6b` or `Distance to Train Station: <500m`). This combination targets sites where planning policy is most likely to support height and density, making an 8-storey scheme plausible.

2.  **Pattern 1A (Old Planning) + Pattern 2D (Liquidation Sales):** My second, more opportunistic approach would be to look for a site that *previously* had planning for a multi-storey mixed-use scheme but it stalled and the corporate owner is now in liquidation. This is a "double-win" scenario: the planning principle has been established, and the seller is maximally motivated, allowing for a below-market acquisition.

3.  **Pattern 6B (Low-Rise Commercial + Residential Overlay):** My third, creative approach would be to find a 1-2 storey commercial building with a flat roof in a strong residential area. I would then use an airspace strategy to build 6-7 storeys of residential on top, creating the 8-storey mixed-use building. This can be a capital-efficient way to achieve the goal.

I would run all three of these divergent approaches in parallel.

## PART 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

**1. Are patterns mapped well to rounds?**
The mapping is okay but could be much better. Round 4 (Behavioral/Motivation) is poorly served. It's not clear which patterns apply.

**2. Should there be a "Round Guide"?**
Yes, absolutely. A "Round Guide" is essential to make the document useful in the collaborative workflow. Without it, agents will waste time re-reading the whole document each round.

**3. Missing Round-Specific Guidance?**
Yes. The current structure doesn't guide the agents on *how* to think during each round.

**Proposed "Round Guide" Integration:**

I suggest adding this section directly after the Master Strategy Matrix.

```markdown
---
## Collaborative Round Guide

This guide maps filter patterns to the specific goals of each collaborative exploration round.

### **Round 2: Regulation/Policy Angle**
**Goal:** Find opportunities created by laws, policies, and regulations.
**Primary Patterns:**
- **Pattern 8 (Regulation-Driven):** START HERE. This is the core of the regulation angle.
  - 8A: HMO Expired Licenses (Forced action)
  - 8C: EPC Compliance Pressure (Forced action)
- **Pattern 7 (PDR):** Exploit regulatory shortcuts (Class MA, Q, G).
- **Pattern 9A (Grey Belt):** Exploit planning policy exceptions for Green Belt.
- **Pattern 5C / 11 (Strategic Allocations):** Leverage sites already blessed by local plan policy.

### **Round 3: Structural/Creative Angle**
**Goal:** Find opportunities based on the physical attributes of land and buildings.
**Primary Patterns:**
- **Pattern 6 (Airspace):** Build on top of existing structures.
- **Pattern 3 (Development Opportunity):** Focus on physical under-development (low density, large plots).
- **Pattern 9A (Grey Belt):** Use `Hardstanding %` as a proxy for demolished structures.
- **Pattern 7D (Infill):** Find unused space on existing plots.
- **NEW: Brownfield Demolition & Rebuild:** Find sites with foundations but no buildings.

### **Round 4: Behavioral/Motivation Angle**
**Goal:** Find opportunities based on owner psychology and circumstances.
**Primary Patterns:**
- **Pattern 2 (Motivated Seller):** START HERE. This is the core of the behavioral angle.
  - 2A: Long Corporate Hold (Impatience)
  - 2D: Liquidation (Distress)
- **Pattern 8B (Lease Expiry):** Target the "income cliff" anxiety.
- **NEW: Legacy Holdings:** Target inherited/untouched properties where owners may be emotionally detached or overwhelmed.
- **Pattern 1 (Stalled Planning):** Find evidence of a previously motivated owner who has now given up.

### **Round 5: Challenge Round**
**Goal:** Combine patterns from previous rounds to create novel, high-value strategies.
**Example Combinations:**
- **(Regulation + Motivation):** Find an `Expired HMO` (Pattern 8A) owned by a `Company in Liquidation` (Pattern 2D).
- **(Structural + Regulation):** Find a `Flat Roof` commercial building (Pattern 6B) eligible for `Class MA` PDR (Pattern 7A).
- **(Behavioral + Structural):** Find a `Legacy Holding` (New Pattern) with a `Large Garden` suitable for `Infill` (Pattern 7D).

## SUMMARY

**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**
1.  **Add a Master Strategy Matrix:** The document needs a top-level matrix mapping patterns to goals (capital, risk, timeline) for quick, effective decision-making.
2.  **Reorganize & Refactor:** The categories should be restructured by strategic driver (Motivation, Value-Add, etc.), and Pattern 13 (Time Arbitrage) must be moved out of the patterns list into a separate "Advanced Workflow" section.
3.  **Add Actionable Snippets & a Round Guide:** Each pattern needs a concrete, copy-pasteable filter snippet. A "Round Guide" is essential to integrate the document into the collaborative workflow effectively.

**Confidence in Current Patterns:** Medium. The raw content, especially in patterns 7-12, is excellent. However, the overall structure, lack of actionable examples, and confusing categorization severely limit its usability.

**Would You Use This Document?** With my suggested changes, yes, it would become an indispensable daily tool. In its current state, it's a frustratingly dense reference file that requires too much effort to use effectively.

**Overall Grade:** C+ (A- for content, D for usability and structure)

# FILTER_PATTERNS.md PEER REVIEW TASK

**Reviewer:** [Gemini / Codex - you are reviewing Claude's work]  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Purpose:** Critique and improve FILTER_PATTERNS.md for better usability

## YOUR TASK

You are an expert UK property analyst reviewing Claude's `FILTER_PATTERNS.md` document. This document contains 13 strategic filter patterns derived from analyzing 86 SearchLand preset filters.

**IMPORTANT:** You are working INDEPENDENTLY. You won't see other reviewers' feedback until later. Provide YOUR OWN analysis without trying to coordinate or collaborate.

**Your job:**
1. **Critique existing patterns** - Are they clear? Complete? Useful?
2. **Suggest new patterns** - What did Claude miss?
3. **Optimize for YOUR usage** - How would you structure this for easier application?

---

thinking
**Planning to read filter patterns**
Plan update
The task requires a multi-part review: critique current patterns, propose new ones, reshape structure, rank usefulness, and suggest workflow integration improvements.
  → Read FILTER_PATTERNS.md plus relevant supporting docs (preset list, strategy guide) to understand current content.
  • Critique each of the 13 existing patterns and document insights using required template.
  • Identify and document at least 3-5 new patterns from raw presets/gaps.
  • Provide structural/usability recommendations, pattern ranking, workflow integration guidance, and final summary.

**Purpose:** Comprehensive reference for all 86 SearchLand expert-designed presets  
**Source:** SearchLand.co.uk preset filters (analyzed 2025-11-19)  
**Status:** Production-ready, validated strategies

## Executive Summary

SearchLand's team has created **86 preset filters** representing validated, expert-designed property strategies. This guide extracts key insights, patterns, and strategic approaches for reuse in custom filter creation.

**Key Discovery:** These presets reveal advanced techniques not documented elsewhere:
- Regulation-driven motivations (HMO licenses, lease expiries, EPC compliance)
- Renewable energy site selection (agricultural grades, substation proximity)
- Green Belt workarounds (previously developed land, hardstanding)
- Commercial viability metrics (footfall/vehicle counts)
- Strategic land promotion (emerging allocations, SHLAA gaps)

# FILTER_PATTERNS.md REVIEW - Codex

**Reviewer:** Codex  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Review Completeness:** 5/5 parts completed

---

## PART 1: CRITIQUE OF EXISTING PATTERNS

## Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Separates date-based and proposal-keyword tactics so we can choose between quantitative and qualitative planning signals (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No guidance on which planning-status filters (Decision, Outcome, Appeal) actually exist, so replicating “stalled” conditions risks capturing live resubmissions (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-40`).  
- “Building on title is inactive” is treated as a binary filter but SearchLand’s preset library shows richer proxies (e.g., “Large sites with planning 10-100 units” already filters by applications) that are not referenced (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:721-730`).  
- No advice on how to pair with price/ownership filters to confirm sellers are still reachable, so the workflow remains theoretical.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Show an explicit filter stack using Decision Date / Status plus Max Dwellings to mirror Preset #63 and prevent false positives (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:721-730`).  
- Add a step for verifying “no recent resubmission” via “Applications in last 12 months = 0” and note how to surface planning references for outreach.  
- Include a follow-up path (option agreement, uplift sharing) so the strategy ties to a deal structure.

**Your Usage:** Would use after bolting on status filters and ownership overlays; in its current form it risks chasing already-active schemes.

---

## Pattern 2: Motivated Seller Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Covers multiple motivation signals (corporate hold, dereliction, transport adjacency, insolvency) giving a layered approach (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:60-150`).  
- Pattern D correctly highlights Companies House status as a forced-sale trigger, plus provides a concrete example filter (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:100-150`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Long market listing relies on a “time on market” filter that does not exist, so the tactic cannot be implemented as written (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:74-85`).  
- No mention of brand/operator datasets (KFC, McDonald’s) or lease expiries that already serve as motivation proxies (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:562-571` and `732-738`).  
- Transport-proximity motivation conflates desirability with distress; without a trigger (lease expiry, EPC failure) we just find nice derelict sites.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Replace the non-existent “time on market” logic with measurable proxies (listing refresh date, price reductions, repeated listings scraped externally).  
- Reference presets #41/#46 that capture expiring QSR leases so we can target landlords with quantifiable vacancy pressure (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:458-466`).  
- Show how to combine motivation filters with capital-specific tactics (options vs direct purchase).

**Your Usage:** Yes, but only after swapping in trackable regulatory signals (lease expiries, EPC deadlines) for market-time assumptions.

---

## Pattern 3: Development Opportunity Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights PTAL 4-6 and low developed-area percentages as reliable densification indicators (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:156-176`).  
- Recognizes “Existing Use + Upside” to keep cash flow during planning (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:184-195`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- “Title area appropriate” appears repeatedly without defining ranges, leaving analysts to guess what fits small vs medium schemes (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:156-195`).  
- Does not tie to ready-made presets like “Vacant land in built-up areas” (#9) or “Land without planning” (#59/#60) that already embody these filters (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-214` and `671-696`).  
- Omits constraint guidance (flood zones, allocations) that often kill deals at this stage.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add decision trees for <0.5 acre, 0.5-2 acre, and 2-10 acre opportunities with explicit area/coverage ranges.  
- Cross-link to relevant presets for each sub-pattern so an agent can immediately load a starting filter.  
- Include a “red flag” list (e.g., SHLAA negative, Conservation Area) to avoid spending time on highly constrained plots.

**Your Usage:** Only as a brainstorming aid; I would still build my own filter stack from presets because the quantitative guardrails are missing.

---

## Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Limited Use  

**Strengths:**  
- Differentiates between direct purchase, options, and derelict turnaround so investors can match structure to liquidity (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:202-242`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Sub-£200k strategy assumes on-market listings and ignores the scarcity of viable listings at that level in target areas (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:202-214`).  
- No mention of ready presets like “Homes to HMO” (#19) or “Older houses with outdoor space” (#69) that cater to sweat-equity entry (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-222` and `783-800`).  
- Option agreement guidance lacks specific motivation signals and legal workflow references.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Provide geographic notes (e.g., focus on lower-value authorities such as Hull, Stoke) and layering tips (auction results, probate).  
- Link each sub-pattern to the most relevant preset(s) so low-capital users don’t start from scratch.  
- Add worked examples showing cash required for option deposit, planning spend, and exit.

**Your Usage:** Rarely—most low-cap opportunities I pursue use preset-driven niche filters rather than hard price caps.

---

## Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Emphasizes PTAL and existing approvals, which are genuine accelerators in London intensification (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-274`).  
- Mentions strategic allocations as a route to policy-backed uplift (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:276-288`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- “Local policy manual research” is vague and provides no map sources (Tall Building SPD, OAPF) so a new analyst cannot action it (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:252-258`).  
- Fails to cite presets like “Large sites with planning 10-100 units” (#63) that already vet schemes for height approvals (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:721-730`).  
- No sensitivity to Section 106/CIL impacts on viability.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Embed references to policy datasets (London Plan tall building maps, ONS density stats) and show how to import them into SearchLand.  
- Provide a sample viability stress test (plot ratio, net:gross conversion).  
- Add tags to indicate which sub-pattern fits Round 3 (structural/creative) so agents can reach for it quickly.

**Your Usage:** Yes for London/metros, but I would need my own policy overlays and viability calculator.

---

## Pattern 6: Airspace Development Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Calls out flat roofs and height headroom, which align with SearchLand’s dedicated airspace presets (#22-#25) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`).  
- Acknowledges structural and freeholder negotiation risks.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores valuable preset differentiators such as “pre-1990 build” and “unbroken freehold” that materially simplify deals (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:229-256`).  
- Does not outline leasehold enfranchisement or rooftop rights acquisition workflows, so the reader cannot judge complexity.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add sub-patterns mirroring presets #24/#25 (pre-1990 blocks, unbroken titles) with filter criteria spelled out.  
- Include a checklist for leaseholder consultation, Section 5 notices, and structural surveys.  
- Provide output metrics (number of new units achievable per m² of existing roof).

**Your Usage:** With amendments; I rely on the preset filters and a standard legal playbook that are currently omitted.

---

## Pattern 7: Permitted Development (PDR) Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Details Class MA, Q, G, and infill with specific eligibility criteria and referenced presets (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:326-445`).  
- Includes profit-calculation logic for Class MA, which is rare in the rest of the document.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Omits Class A and Class ZA presets despite their presence in the raw list (#30 and #33), leaving obvious PDR routes undocumented (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:300-389`).  
- Does not flag Article 4 withdrawal areas beyond a passing mention, even though that is the main practical blocker for MA/G.  
- No template for prior-approval timelines or typical consultant costs.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add patterns for Class A extensions (garden depth, ridge lines) and Class ZA knock-down/rebuild to cover the full preset family.  
- Provide a matrix of Article 4 boroughs/districts and suggest fallback strategies where PDR is withdrawn.  
- Include a financial summary (fees, build cost per sq m, resale assumptions) per PDR class.

**Your Usage:** Yes—after supplementing with Article 4 data and the missing PDR classes.

---

## Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Presents strong motivation logic for expired HMO licences, lease expiries, and EPC compliance, each with supporting presets (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:451-607`).  
- Provides detailed timelines for lease expiries, helping cadence outreach (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:497-543`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Leaves out other regulation-driven presets such as “Homes to HMO” (#19) and “Single flats with expiring leases” (#78) that also hinge on legal deadlines (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-214` and `893-901`).  
- EPC section is very broad and risks unworkable result volumes without layering (ownership type, geography) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:546-574`).  
- No talk track for compliance-oriented approaches (help owners refurbish vs buy).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Expand the section to include leasehold reversion plays and Article 4-safe HMO conversions with explicit preset references.  
- Recommend pairing EPC triggers with ownership size (e.g., companies with >30 titles) to focus on likely sellers (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:401-408`).  
- Provide outreach scripts/value propositions tailored to each regulation scenario.

**Your Usage:** Absolutely; this is the richest source of motivated stock once the missing sub-patterns are added.

---

## Pattern 9: Green Belt Workarounds

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Explains “previously developed land” logic using hardstanding percentage and proximity to built-up areas (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:610-661`).  
- Notes edge-of-settlement promotion with SHLAA gaps (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:664-726`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Does not mention other preset options like Green Belt solar (#45) or storage uses (#57) that exploit different policy carve-outs (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:515-658`).  
- Missing a reminder about recent NPPF/PF revisions (e.g., “Grey Belt” consultation outcomes) that affect viability.  
- No discussion of evidencing “previously developed land” (historic aerials, OS maps).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add sub-patterns for renewable exemptions (solar/battery) and commercial uses (storage) to match presets #45 and #57.  
- Include a data checklist (historic imagery, planning history) to defend “grey belt” claims at committee.  
- Highlight councils actively reviewing Green Belt boundaries so agents know where to spend time.

**Your Usage:** Yes, though I would fold in renewable/storage plays to make the category complete.

---

## Pattern 10: Renewable Energy Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Thoroughly documents solar ground-mount and industrial rooftop criteria including substations, grades, and ROI models (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:732-852`).  
- Adds battery/hydrogen/wind sub-patterns with setbacks and capital needs (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:853-955`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No coverage of EV-charging or bioenergy presets (#54, #52) even though they share similar land requirements (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:609-656`).  
- Lacks guidance on grid-capacity vetting (G99 queue, DNO engagement) beyond the “green substation” filter.  
- No mention of community benefits or planning sensitivities (glint/glare, heritage).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add EV charging/bioenergy sub-patterns referencing presets #54/#52 to diversify revenue models.  
- Include a workflow for pre-consulting the DNO and budgeting grid-upgrade deposits.  
- Provide a policy summary (NPS EN-3 update, local renewable allocations) to support applications.

**Your Usage:** Yes for energy clients, with added grid diligence steps.

## Pattern 11: Strategic Land Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights emerging allocations with no planning and large employment allocations (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1053`).  
- Provides option-cost guidance (£10k-£50k) which helps scoping.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores other strategic presets (edge-of-settlement #13/#18, unallocated no SHLAA #85/#86) that broaden the funnel (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-222` and `845-857`).  
- No instructions on Local Plan timelines, Regulation 18/19 stages, or promotion agreement structuring.  
- Doesn’t address infrastructure obligations (spine roads, utilities) that can kill smaller operators.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add sub-patterns for SHLAA omissions and legacy estates to cover all 8 relevant presets.  
- Provide a Local Plan calendar template and engagement workflow (Reg18 reps, Reg19 objections).  
- Include indicative infrastructure cost ranges so analysts can assess capital appetite early.

**Your Usage:** Yes for land-promotion briefs, but I need the missing SHLAA/edge filters and process notes.

---

## Pattern 12: Commercial Traffic-Dependent Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Uses quantifiable footfall/vehicle-count thresholds tied to branded presets (#27, #46, #54, #58, #72) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1059-1170`).  
- Pattern C acknowledges niche sectors like padel courts and care homes with key dimensions given (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1173-1223`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Treats “niche markets” as a catch-all without distinguishing data sources or buyer profiles, which dilutes focus (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1173-1221`).  
- Lacks cost/yield benchmarks for EV, drive-thru, or retail to help prioritise leads.  
- No mention of competition filters (e.g., radius to nearest EV charger is available in presets #54/#84 but absent in the write-up).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Break Pattern C into separate subsections (Padel, Care, Data Centre retail) with outcome metrics and preset references.  
- Add ROI snippets (expected rent per sq ft, cap rates) for each use.  
- Include “competition” filter guidance (distance to existing chargers/QSR) to raise conversion odds.

**Your Usage:** Yes for quick-service and EV work, but I would spin out each niche into its own playbook.

---

## Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides detailed rationale and implementation requirements (exports, diffing, alerts) for acting on daily SearchLand refreshes (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1281-1396`).  
- Includes an illustrative deal flow showing how the arbitrage converts into cash within days (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1424-1444`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Relies entirely on external automation without linking to specific SearchLand filters that feed the exports, so newcomers might not know where to start.  
- Omits compliance considerations (GDPR when contacting owners the same day, Companies House spam rules).  
- Doesn’t prioritise which arbitrage events matter most (planning approval vs allocation vs lease expiry), so resources may be spread thin.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Provide ready-to-run export templates referencing earlier patterns (e.g., Pattern 8B lease-expiry filters) to close the loop.  
- Rank the sub-patterns by margin/volume and suggest staffing per trigger.  
- Add legal guidance on contact cadence and script approval.

**Your Usage:** Yes, but only once a monitoring stack (SearchLand API + CRM + dialer) is fully documented.

---

## PART 2: NEW PATTERNS PROPOSED

## NEW PATTERN: Nutrient Neutrality Offset Banking

**Category:** Regulation-Driven / Environmental Mitigation  

**Strategic Rationale:** LPAs inside Solent, Norfolk, and Tees catchments need off-site nutrient credits before granting resi permissions. Buying or optioning Grade 3b/4 cereal land in the designated zones lets you sell offset capacity to housebuilders who are otherwise stuck.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Ownership: Freehold, private/company (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:438-447`).  
2. Site size: >80,000 sq m (enough for meaningful mitigation) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:443-444`).  
3. Habitat: Cereal crops (high phosphate output to convert) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:445-446`).  
4. Constraint: Nutrient neutrality area = TRUE.  
5. Optional: Within 20 km of growth settlements to ease transactional logistics.

**Sourced From:** Preset #39 plus current DEFRA nutrient mitigation policy.

**Use Cases:** Pair with stalled residential schemes needing credits; structure long leases with developers that fund the rewilding works.

**Expected Results:** Low capital (options/leases), £10k-£40k per dwelling equivalent in credit sales, timelines 6-18 months.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Digital Infrastructure Campus Assembly

**Category:** Development Opportunity / Specialist Infrastructure  

**Strategic Rationale:** Data centres and AI training campuses require large, flat B2/B8 plots within 2 km of a high-capacity substation. These are scarce, so assembling suitable titles and securing grid queue positions creates outsized land value.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Site size: >60,000 sq m (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:600-603`).  
2. Terrain: >99% flat, >70% unconstrained (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:604-605`).  
3. Land use: B2 or B8.  
4. Power: Within 2,000 m of substation, ideally “green” capacity.  
5. Ownership: Corporate/private (fast negotiation).  

**Sourced From:** Preset #53, plus demand surge from hyperscalers.

**Use Cases:** Option land and pre-let to cloud providers; or package for speculative colocation developers.

**Expected Results:** Site premiums of £1m-£2m per acre in hot markets; 18-36 month promotion cycles.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Community Asset Repositioning

**Category:** Development Opportunity / Social Infrastructure  

**Strategic Rationale:** Under-utilised institutional land (schools, community halls, care homes) near hospitals and town centres can be recycled into senior living, health hubs, or residential through JV with councils/trustees. Presets #28 and #37/#62 already isolate these titles.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: F1/F2/C2/E(f) with >40% hardstanding (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:419-427` and `706-717`).  
2. Size: 650-10,300 sq m (enough for conversion without complex estate regeneration).  
3. Proximity: Within 500 m of hospitals or major bus routes for care demand (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:324-330`).  
4. Ownership: Private trusts or non-profit (no corporate restrictions).  
5. Option: No recent planning applications (lightly contested).  

**Sourced From:** Presets #28, #37, #62 plus local authority disposal pipelines.

**Use Cases:** Forward-fund extra care, co-locate medical hubs, secure community asset transfers before marketing.

**Expected Results:** Deal sizes £2m-£10m GDV; planning timelines 12-24 months; higher success where councils target health provision.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Brand Covenant Reposition (QSR & Retail)

**Category:** Motivated Seller / Commercial Traffic  

**Strategic Rationale:** Franchise networks regularly rebalance estates; brand-specific datasets (KFC #50, McDonald’s #64) plus lease-expiry presets allow targeted sale-leaseback or redevelopment plays when corporate covenants vacate.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Company/tenant name contains target brand (KFC, McDonald’s etc.) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:562-571` and `732-738`).  
2. Lease end date within 18 months (combine with Pattern 8B logic).  
3. Footfall >2,000/day or vehicle count >10,000/day to ensure re-letting viability (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1059-1170`).  
4. Plot size 1,000-20,000 sq m for drive-thru or infill alternatives.  
5. Ownership: corporate freehold or franchise SPV.

**Sourced From:** Presets #50, #64, #46, #58; industry knowledge of sale-leaseback spreads.

**Use Cases:** Negotiate reverse premium to take back underperforming stores, redevelop to mixed-use, or re-let to competing brands.

**Expected Results:** £0.5m-£5m deal ticket; 5-10% yield arbitrage on covenant swaps; 6-18 month execution.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Micro-Infill Service Yard Conversions

**Category:** Low-Capital / Permitted Development  

**Strategic Rationale:** Small garages, car parks, and MOT yards contiguous to housing (Presets #29 and #42) are ideal for single-plot infill, new-build mews, or EV charging clusters with minimal land cost.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: Car park or B2/E(g)(iii) garage (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:333-339` and `465-474`).  
2. Size: 300-4,000 sq m (sweet spot for 2-10 units).  
3. Proximity: Within 20 m of residential (ready utilities) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:472-474`).  
4. Planning history: Proposal keywords “garage/MOT/tyre” for conversion precedent (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:476-479`).  
5. Ownership: Private/company (one title).  

**Sourced From:** Presets #29, #42 and established mews-developer strategies.

**Use Cases:** Low-capital option or overage agreements, Class G or F carve-outs, EV micro depots.

**Expected Results:** 2-8 units per site, £200k-£1m GDV, 9-18 month timeline, capital input £50k-£200k.

---

## PART 3: STRUCTURE & USABILITY

- **Add a pattern index/table with tags:** Right now analysts scroll 1,400+ lines to find relevant filters; a matrix tagging each pattern by capital, motivation, planning stage, and rounds would cut lookup time (no equivalent exists today beyond the short budget/risk bullets at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1231-1250`).  
- **Embed preset references in every pattern:** Only some sections cite preset numbers; many (Patterns 1,3,5,6,11) leave you guessing which raw filters to load. Add “Starting presets” lists for every sub-pattern to honour the instruction to reuse all 86 presets.  
- **Use consistent template blocks:** Some patterns include Strengths/Weaknesses (e.g., 10A) while others are pure bullet lists; align them so agents know where to find capital requirements, risk, workflow.  
- **Introduce cross-links to LEARNINGS_DATABASE and anti-patterns:** Pattern 8 references LEARNINGS once (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:491-493`), but others don’t signpost where to read caveats; add callouts pointing to relevant Learnings entries to stop repeated mistakes.  
- **Decision-tree overlays per round:** Provide a “Round 2/3/4/5 quick pick” chart mapping patterns to collaborative stages; currently we only see an abstract combination example at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1256-1274`.

---

## PART 4: PATTERN RANKING

| Rank | Pattern # | Pattern Name | Why This Ranking? |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 8 | Regulation-Driven Opportunities | Strongest motivation data, multiple presets, clear timelines (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:451-607`). |
| 2 | 2 | Motivated Seller Strategies | Broad mix of seller distress signals including insolvency (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:60-150`). |
| 3 | 13 | Time/Information Arbitrage | Converts SearchLand’s daily refresh into unique deal flow; needs tooling but high ROI (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1281-1444`). |
| 4 | 7 | Permitted Development Strategies | Actionable, policy-backed, with quantified criteria (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:326-445`). |
| 5 | 10 | Renewable Energy Strategies | Deep detail and capital guidance; strong for infrastructure mandates (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:732-955`). |
| 6 | 9 | Green Belt Workarounds | Niche but valuable guidance on previously developed land exceptions (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:610-726`). |
| 7 | 12 | Commercial Traffic Strategies | Quantified demand metrics yet needs competitive context (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1059-1223`). |
| 8 | 3 | Development Opportunity Strategies | Useful heuristics but lacks preset mapping and thresholds (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:156-195`). |
| 9 | 5 | High-Density/Intensification | Highlights PTAL but thin on execution detail (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-288`). |
|10 | 11 | Strategic Land Promotion | Describes only part of the preset set and omits plan process steps (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1053`). |
|11 | 6 | Airspace Development | Captures basics but misses key preset variants and legal workflow (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`). |
|12 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | Relies on scarce on-market deals; limited presets referenced (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:202-242`). |
|13 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | Too vague on filters/status logic to implement reliably (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`). |

**Real-World Test:** For “MixedUse-8Storey-2M profit on £200k capital,” I’d combine Pattern 5 (tall building zones) to target policy-backed height (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-274`), Pattern 6 (airspace) for adding storeys to existing low-rise stock (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`), and Pattern 2D (liquidation) to cap acquisition price (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:100-150`). Overlay Pattern 13B’s monitoring so we pounce on fresh consents matching those filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1303-1319`).

---

## PART 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

- **Round-to-pattern mapping:** Create a table showing which patterns apply to each collaborative round (Regulation → Pattern 8 & Nutrient Offset; Structural → Patterns 5/6; Behavioural → Patterns 2/13; Challenge → Patterns 9/11). The Strategy Selection Guide is capital/risk-based, not round-based (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1229-1250`).  
- **Round-specific prompts:** For each round, add “If/Then” prompts (e.g., “If lease expires <12 months and footfall >2k → use 8B + 12A”) so agents don’t improvise during live sessions.  
- **Shared monitoring checklist:** Pattern 13’s automation steps should be summarized in a reusable “Round 5 readiness” checklist (export IDs, alert cadence) to ensure every agent sees the same alerts (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1374-1396`).  
- **Learning hooks:** Encourage agents to feed discoveries back into LEARNINGS_DATABASE after each round, linking entries by pattern ID to keep institutional memory fresh.  
- **Challenge Round playbook:** Provide adversarial questions per pattern (e.g., “What if Article 4 removes MA?”) so Round 5 explicitly pressure-tests the chosen filters.

---

## SUMMARY

**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**  
1. Map every pattern/sub-pattern to concrete SearchLand presets and add missing presets (Class ZA, SHLAA gaps, nutrient neutrality).  
2. Introduce structural navigation aids—pattern index, tags, and round-based decision trees—to reduce lookup time and align with collaborative workflow.  
3. Expand motivation/regulation coverage (leasehold reversions, nutrient credits, brand covenants) to capture uncovered strategies from the 86 presets.

**Confidence in Current Patterns:** Medium — several are actionable, but missing presets and vague filters risk misapplication.

**Would You Use This Document?** With changes — I need the preset mapping and round guides before relying on it in live searches.

**Overall Grade:** B-

## PART 1: CRITIQUE OF EXISTING PATTERNS

## Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Separates date-based and proposal-keyword tactics so we can choose between quantitative and qualitative planning signals (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No guidance on which planning-status filters (Decision, Outcome, Appeal) actually exist, so replicating “stalled” conditions risks capturing live resubmissions (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-40`).  
- “Building on title is inactive” is treated as a binary filter but SearchLand’s preset library shows richer proxies (e.g., “Large sites with planning 10-100 units” already filters by applications) that are not referenced (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:721-730`).  
- No advice on how to pair with price/ownership filters to confirm sellers are still reachable, so the workflow remains theoretical.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Show an explicit filter stack using Decision Date / Status plus Max Dwellings to mirror Preset #63 and prevent false positives (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:721-730`).  
- Add a step for verifying “no recent resubmission” via “Applications in last 12 months = 0” and note how to surface planning references for outreach.  
- Include a follow-up path (option agreement, uplift sharing) so the strategy ties to a deal structure.

**Your Usage:** Would use after bolting on status filters and ownership overlays; in its current form it risks chasing already-active schemes.

---

## Pattern 2: Motivated Seller Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Covers multiple motivation signals (corporate hold, dereliction, transport adjacency, insolvency) giving a layered approach (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:60-150`).  
- Pattern D correctly highlights Companies House status as a forced-sale trigger, plus provides a concrete example filter (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:100-150`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Long market listing relies on a “time on market” filter that does not exist, so the tactic cannot be implemented as written (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:74-85`).  
- No mention of brand/operator datasets (KFC, McDonald’s) or lease expiries that already serve as motivation proxies (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:562-571` and `732-738`).  
- Transport-proximity motivation conflates desirability with distress; without a trigger (lease expiry, EPC failure) we just find nice derelict sites.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Replace the non-existent “time on market” logic with measurable proxies (listing refresh date, price reductions, repeated listings scraped externally).  
- Reference presets #41/#46 that capture expiring QSR leases so we can target landlords with quantifiable vacancy pressure (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:458-466`).  
- Show how to combine motivation filters with capital-specific tactics (options vs direct purchase).

**Your Usage:** Yes, but only after swapping in trackable regulatory signals (lease expiries, EPC deadlines) for market-time assumptions.

---

## Pattern 3: Development Opportunity Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights PTAL 4-6 and low developed-area percentages as reliable densification indicators (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:156-176`).  
- Recognizes “Existing Use + Upside” to keep cash flow during planning (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:184-195`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- “Title area appropriate” appears repeatedly without defining ranges, leaving analysts to guess what fits small vs medium schemes (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:156-195`).  
- Does not tie to ready-made presets like “Vacant land in built-up areas” (#9) or “Land without planning” (#59/#60) that already embody these filters (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-214` and `671-696`).  
- Omits constraint guidance (flood zones, allocations) that often kill deals at this stage.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add decision trees for <0.5 acre, 0.5-2 acre, and 2-10 acre opportunities with explicit area/coverage ranges.  
- Cross-link to relevant presets for each sub-pattern so an agent can immediately load a starting filter.  
- Include a “red flag” list (e.g., SHLAA negative, Conservation Area) to avoid spending time on highly constrained plots.

**Your Usage:** Only as a brainstorming aid; I would still build my own filter stack from presets because the quantitative guardrails are missing.

---

## Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Limited Use  

**Strengths:**  
- Differentiates between direct purchase, options, and derelict turnaround so investors can match structure to liquidity (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:202-242`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Sub-£200k strategy assumes on-market listings and ignores the scarcity of viable listings at that level in target areas (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:202-214`).  
- No mention of ready presets like “Homes to HMO” (#19) or “Older houses with outdoor space” (#69) that cater to sweat-equity entry (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-222` and `783-800`).  
- Option agreement guidance lacks specific motivation signals and legal workflow references.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Provide geographic notes (e.g., focus on lower-value authorities such as Hull, Stoke) and layering tips (auction results, probate).  
- Link each sub-pattern to the most relevant preset(s) so low-capital users don’t start from scratch.  
- Add worked examples showing cash required for option deposit, planning spend, and exit.

**Your Usage:** Rarely—most low-cap opportunities I pursue use preset-driven niche filters rather than hard price caps.

---

## Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Emphasizes PTAL and existing approvals, which are genuine accelerators in London intensification (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-274`).  
- Mentions strategic allocations as a route to policy-backed uplift (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:276-288`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- “Local policy manual research” is vague and provides no map sources (Tall Building SPD, OAPF) so a new analyst cannot action it (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:252-258`).  
- Fails to cite presets like “Large sites with planning 10-100 units” (#63) that already vet schemes for height approvals (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:721-730`).  
- No sensitivity to Section 106/CIL impacts on viability.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Embed references to policy datasets (London Plan tall building maps, ONS density stats) and show how to import them into SearchLand.  
- Provide a sample viability stress test (plot ratio, net:gross conversion).  
- Add tags to indicate which sub-pattern fits Round 3 (structural/creative) so agents can reach for it quickly.

**Your Usage:** Yes for London/metros, but I would need my own policy overlays and viability calculator.

---

## Pattern 6: Airspace Development Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Calls out flat roofs and height headroom, which align with SearchLand’s dedicated airspace presets (#22-#25) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`).  
- Acknowledges structural and freeholder negotiation risks.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores valuable preset differentiators such as “pre-1990 build” and “unbroken freehold” that materially simplify deals (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:229-256`).  
- Does not outline leasehold enfranchisement or rooftop rights acquisition workflows, so the reader cannot judge complexity.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add sub-patterns mirroring presets #24/#25 (pre-1990 blocks, unbroken titles) with filter criteria spelled out.  
- Include a checklist for leaseholder consultation, Section 5 notices, and structural surveys.  
- Provide output metrics (number of new units achievable per m² of existing roof).

**Your Usage:** With amendments; I rely on the preset filters and a standard legal playbook that are currently omitted.

---

## Pattern 7: Permitted Development (PDR) Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Details Class MA, Q, G, and infill with specific eligibility criteria and referenced presets (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:326-445`).  
- Includes profit-calculation logic for Class MA, which is rare in the rest of the document.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Omits Class A and Class ZA presets despite their presence in the raw list (#30 and #33), leaving obvious PDR routes undocumented (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:300-389`).  
- Does not flag Article 4 withdrawal areas beyond a passing mention, even though that is the main practical blocker for MA/G.  
- No template for prior-approval timelines or typical consultant costs.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add patterns for Class A extensions (garden depth, ridge lines) and Class ZA knock-down/rebuild to cover the full preset family.  
- Provide a matrix of Article 4 boroughs/districts and suggest fallback strategies where PDR is withdrawn.  
- Include a financial summary (fees, build cost per sq m, resale assumptions) per PDR class.

**Your Usage:** Yes—after supplementing with Article 4 data and the missing PDR classes.

---

## Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Presents strong motivation logic for expired HMO licences, lease expiries, and EPC compliance, each with supporting presets (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:451-607`).  
- Provides detailed timelines for lease expiries, helping cadence outreach (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:497-543`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Leaves out other regulation-driven presets such as “Homes to HMO” (#19) and “Single flats with expiring leases” (#78) that also hinge on legal deadlines (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-214` and `893-901`).  
- EPC section is very broad and risks unworkable result volumes without layering (ownership type, geography) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:546-574`).  
- No talk track for compliance-oriented approaches (help owners refurbish vs buy).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Expand the section to include leasehold reversion plays and Article 4-safe HMO conversions with explicit preset references.  
- Recommend pairing EPC triggers with ownership size (e.g., companies with >30 titles) to focus on likely sellers (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:401-408`).  
- Provide outreach scripts/value propositions tailored to each regulation scenario.

**Your Usage:** Absolutely; this is the richest source of motivated stock once the missing sub-patterns are added.

---

## Pattern 9: Green Belt Workarounds

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Explains “previously developed land” logic using hardstanding percentage and proximity to built-up areas (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:610-661`).  
- Notes edge-of-settlement promotion with SHLAA gaps (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:664-726`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Does not mention other preset options like Green Belt solar (#45) or storage uses (#57) that exploit different policy carve-outs (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:515-658`).  
- Missing a reminder about recent NPPF/PF revisions (e.g., “Grey Belt” consultation outcomes) that affect viability.  
- No discussion of evidencing “previously developed land” (historic aerials, OS maps).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add sub-patterns for renewable exemptions (solar/battery) and commercial uses (storage) to match presets #45 and #57.  
- Include a data checklist (historic imagery, planning history) to defend “grey belt” claims at committee.  
- Highlight councils actively reviewing Green Belt boundaries so agents know where to spend time.

**Your Usage:** Yes, though I would fold in renewable/storage plays to make the category complete.

---

## Pattern 10: Renewable Energy Strategies

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Somewhat Complete  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Thoroughly documents solar ground-mount and industrial rooftop criteria including substations, grades, and ROI models (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:732-852`).  
- Adds battery/hydrogen/wind sub-patterns with setbacks and capital needs (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:853-955`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- No coverage of EV-charging or bioenergy presets (#54, #52) even though they share similar land requirements (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:609-656`).  
- Lacks guidance on grid-capacity vetting (G99 queue, DNO engagement) beyond the “green substation” filter.  
- No mention of community benefits or planning sensitivities (glint/glare, heritage).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add EV charging/bioenergy sub-patterns referencing presets #54/#52 to diversify revenue models.  
- Include a workflow for pre-consulting the DNO and budgeting grid-upgrade deposits.  
- Provide a policy summary (NPS EN-3 update, local renewable allocations) to support applications.

**Your Usage:** Yes for energy clients, with added grid diligence steps.

## Pattern 11: Strategic Land Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights emerging allocations with no planning and large employment allocations (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1053`).  
- Provides option-cost guidance (£10k-£50k) which helps scoping.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores other strategic presets (edge-of-settlement #13/#18, unallocated no SHLAA #85/#86) that broaden the funnel (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-222` and `845-857`).  
- No instructions on Local Plan timelines, Regulation 18/19 stages, or promotion agreement structuring.  
- Doesn’t address infrastructure obligations (spine roads, utilities) that can kill smaller operators.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Add sub-patterns for SHLAA omissions and legacy estates to cover all 8 relevant presets.  
- Provide a Local Plan calendar template and engagement workflow (Reg18 reps, Reg19 objections).  
- Include indicative infrastructure cost ranges so analysts can assess capital appetite early.

**Your Usage:** Yes for land-promotion briefs, but I need the missing SHLAA/edge filters and process notes.

---

## Pattern 12: Commercial Traffic-Dependent Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Uses quantifiable footfall/vehicle-count thresholds tied to branded presets (#27, #46, #54, #58, #72) (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1059-1170`).  
- Pattern C acknowledges niche sectors like padel courts and care homes with key dimensions given (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1173-1223`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Treats “niche markets” as a catch-all without distinguishing data sources or buyer profiles, which dilutes focus (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1173-1221`).  
- Lacks cost/yield benchmarks for EV, drive-thru, or retail to help prioritise leads.  
- No mention of competition filters (e.g., radius to nearest EV charger is available in presets #54/#84 but absent in the write-up).

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Break Pattern C into separate subsections (Padel, Care, Data Centre retail) with outcome metrics and preset references.  
- Add ROI snippets (expected rent per sq ft, cap rates) for each use.  
- Include “competition” filter guidance (distance to existing chargers/QSR) to raise conversion odds.

**Your Usage:** Yes for quick-service and EV work, but I would spin out each niche into its own playbook.

---

## Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Provides detailed rationale and implementation requirements (exports, diffing, alerts) for acting on daily SearchLand refreshes (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1281-1396`).  
- Includes an illustrative deal flow showing how the arbitrage converts into cash within days (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1424-1444`).

**Weaknesses:**  
- Relies entirely on external automation without linking to specific SearchLand filters that feed the exports, so newcomers might not know where to start.  
- Omits compliance considerations (GDPR when contacting owners the same day, Companies House spam rules).  
- Doesn’t prioritise which arbitrage events matter most (planning approval vs allocation vs lease expiry), so resources may be spread thin.

**Suggested Improvements:**  
- Provide ready-to-run export templates referencing earlier patterns (e.g., Pattern 8B lease-expiry filters) to close the loop.  
- Rank the sub-patterns by margin/volume and suggest staffing per trigger.  
- Add legal guidance on contact cadence and script approval.

**Your Usage:** Yes, but only once a monitoring stack (SearchLand API + CRM + dialer) is fully documented.

---

## PART 2: NEW PATTERNS PROPOSED

## NEW PATTERN: Nutrient Neutrality Offset Banking

**Category:** Regulation-Driven / Environmental Mitigation  

**Strategic Rationale:** LPAs inside Solent, Norfolk, and Tees catchments need off-site nutrient credits before granting resi permissions. Buying or optioning Grade 3b/4 cereal land in the designated zones lets you sell offset capacity to housebuilders who are otherwise stuck.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Ownership: Freehold, private/company (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:438-447`).  
2. Site size: >80,000 sq m (enough for meaningful mitigation) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:443-444`).  
3. Habitat: Cereal crops (high phosphate output to convert) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:445-446`).  
4. Constraint: Nutrient neutrality area = TRUE.  
5. Optional: Within 20 km of growth settlements to ease transactional logistics.

**Sourced From:** Preset #39 plus current DEFRA nutrient mitigation policy.

**Use Cases:** Pair with stalled residential schemes needing credits; structure long leases with developers that fund the rewilding works.

**Expected Results:** Low capital (options/leases), £10k-£40k per dwelling equivalent in credit sales, timelines 6-18 months.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Digital Infrastructure Campus Assembly

**Category:** Development Opportunity / Specialist Infrastructure  

**Strategic Rationale:** Data centres and AI training campuses require large, flat B2/B8 plots within 2 km of a high-capacity substation. These are scarce, so assembling suitable titles and securing grid queue positions creates outsized land value.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Site size: >60,000 sq m (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:600-603`).  
2. Terrain: >99% flat, >70% unconstrained (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:604-605`).  
3. Land use: B2 or B8.  
4. Power: Within 2,000 m of substation, ideally “green” capacity.  
5. Ownership: Corporate/private (fast negotiation).  

**Sourced From:** Preset #53, plus demand surge from hyperscalers.

**Use Cases:** Option land and pre-let to cloud providers; or package for speculative colocation developers.

**Expected Results:** Site premiums of £1m-£2m per acre in hot markets; 18-36 month promotion cycles.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Community Asset Repositioning

**Category:** Development Opportunity / Social Infrastructure  

**Strategic Rationale:** Under-utilised institutional land (schools, community halls, care homes) near hospitals and town centres can be recycled into senior living, health hubs, or residential through JV with councils/trustees. Presets #28 and #37/#62 already isolate these titles.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: F1/F2/C2/E(f) with >40% hardstanding (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:419-427` and `706-717`).  
2. Size: 650-10,300 sq m (enough for conversion without complex estate regeneration).  
3. Proximity: Within 500 m of hospitals or major bus routes for care demand (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:324-330`).  
4. Ownership: Private trusts or non-profit (no corporate restrictions).  
5. Option: No recent planning applications (lightly contested).  

**Sourced From:** Presets #28, #37, #62 plus local authority disposal pipelines.

**Use Cases:** Forward-fund extra care, co-locate medical hubs, secure community asset transfers before marketing.

**Expected Results:** Deal sizes £2m-£10m GDV; planning timelines 12-24 months; higher success where councils target health provision.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Brand Covenant Reposition (QSR & Retail)

**Category:** Motivated Seller / Commercial Traffic  

**Strategic Rationale:** Franchise networks regularly rebalance estates; brand-specific datasets (KFC #50, McDonald’s #64) plus lease-expiry presets allow targeted sale-leaseback or redevelopment plays when corporate covenants vacate.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Company/tenant name contains target brand (KFC, McDonald’s etc.) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:562-571` and `732-738`).  
2. Lease end date within 18 months (combine with Pattern 8B logic).  
3. Footfall >2,000/day or vehicle count >10,000/day to ensure re-letting viability (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1059-1170`).  
4. Plot size 1,000-20,000 sq m for drive-thru or infill alternatives.  
5. Ownership: corporate freehold or franchise SPV.

**Sourced From:** Presets #50, #64, #46, #58; industry knowledge of sale-leaseback spreads.

**Use Cases:** Negotiate reverse premium to take back underperforming stores, redevelop to mixed-use, or re-let to competing brands.

**Expected Results:** £0.5m-£5m deal ticket; 5-10% yield arbitrage on covenant swaps; 6-18 month execution.

---

## NEW PATTERN: Micro-Infill Service Yard Conversions

**Category:** Low-Capital / Permitted Development  

**Strategic Rationale:** Small garages, car parks, and MOT yards contiguous to housing (Presets #29 and #42) are ideal for single-plot infill, new-build mews, or EV charging clusters with minimal land cost.  

**Key Filters:**  
1. Use class: Car park or B2/E(g)(iii) garage (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:333-339` and `465-474`).  
2. Size: 300-4,000 sq m (sweet spot for 2-10 units).  
3. Proximity: Within 20 m of residential (ready utilities) (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:472-474`).  
4. Planning history: Proposal keywords “garage/MOT/tyre” for conversion precedent (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:476-479`).  
5. Ownership: Private/company (one title).  

**Sourced From:** Presets #29, #42 and established mews-developer strategies.

**Use Cases:** Low-capital option or overage agreements, Class G or F carve-outs, EV micro depots.

**Expected Results:** 2-8 units per site, £200k-£1m GDV, 9-18 month timeline, capital input £50k-£200k.

---

## PART 3: STRUCTURE & USABILITY

- **Add a pattern index/table with tags:** Right now analysts scroll 1,400+ lines to find relevant filters; a matrix tagging each pattern by capital, motivation, planning stage, and rounds would cut lookup time (no equivalent exists today beyond the short budget/risk bullets at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1231-1250`).  
- **Embed preset references in every pattern:** Only some sections cite preset numbers; many (Patterns 1,3,5,6,11) leave you guessing which raw filters to load. Add “Starting presets” lists for every sub-pattern to honour the instruction to reuse all 86 presets.  
- **Use consistent template blocks:** Some patterns include Strengths/Weaknesses (e.g., 10A) while others are pure bullet lists; align them so agents know where to find capital requirements, risk, workflow.  
- **Introduce cross-links to LEARNINGS_DATABASE and anti-patterns:** Pattern 8 references LEARNINGS once (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:491-493`), but others don’t signpost where to read caveats; add callouts pointing to relevant Learnings entries to stop repeated mistakes.  
- **Decision-tree overlays per round:** Provide a “Round 2/3/4/5 quick pick” chart mapping patterns to collaborative stages; currently we only see an abstract combination example at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1256-1274`.

---

## PART 4: PATTERN RANKING

| Rank | Pattern # | Pattern Name | Why This Ranking? |
|------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 8 | Regulation-Driven Opportunities | Strongest motivation data, multiple presets, clear timelines (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:451-607`). |
| 2 | 2 | Motivated Seller Strategies | Broad mix of seller distress signals including insolvency (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:60-150`). |
| 3 | 13 | Time/Information Arbitrage | Converts SearchLand’s daily refresh into unique deal flow; needs tooling but high ROI (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1281-1444`). |
| 4 | 7 | Permitted Development Strategies | Actionable, policy-backed, with quantified criteria (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:326-445`). |
| 5 | 10 | Renewable Energy Strategies | Deep detail and capital guidance; strong for infrastructure mandates (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:732-955`). |
| 6 | 9 | Green Belt Workarounds | Niche but valuable guidance on previously developed land exceptions (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:610-726`). |
| 7 | 12 | Commercial Traffic Strategies | Quantified demand metrics yet needs competitive context (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1059-1223`). |
| 8 | 3 | Development Opportunity Strategies | Useful heuristics but lacks preset mapping and thresholds (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:156-195`). |
| 9 | 5 | High-Density/Intensification | Highlights PTAL but thin on execution detail (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-288`). |
|10 | 11 | Strategic Land Promotion | Describes only part of the preset set and omits plan process steps (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1053`). |
|11 | 6 | Airspace Development | Captures basics but misses key preset variants and legal workflow (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`). |
|12 | 4 | Low Capital Entry | Relies on scarce on-market deals; limited presets referenced (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:202-242`). |
|13 | 1 | Expired/Stalled Planning | Too vague on filters/status logic to implement reliably (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:29-54`). |

**Real-World Test:** For “MixedUse-8Storey-2M profit on £200k capital,” I’d combine Pattern 5 (tall building zones) to target policy-backed height (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:248-274`), Pattern 6 (airspace) for adding storeys to existing low-rise stock (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:294-320`), and Pattern 2D (liquidation) to cap acquisition price (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:100-150`). Overlay Pattern 13B’s monitoring so we pounce on fresh consents matching those filters (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1303-1319`).

---

## PART 5: WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

- **Round-to-pattern mapping:** Create a table showing which patterns apply to each collaborative round (Regulation → Pattern 8 & Nutrient Offset; Structural → Patterns 5/6; Behavioural → Patterns 2/13; Challenge → Patterns 9/11). The Strategy Selection Guide is capital/risk-based, not round-based (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1229-1250`).  
- **Round-specific prompts:** For each round, add “If/Then” prompts (e.g., “If lease expires <12 months and footfall >2k → use 8B + 12A”) so agents don’t improvise during live sessions.  
- **Shared monitoring checklist:** Pattern 13’s automation steps should be summarized in a reusable “Round 5 readiness” checklist (export IDs, alert cadence) to ensure every agent sees the same alerts (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1374-1396`).  
- **Learning hooks:** Encourage agents to feed discoveries back into LEARNINGS_DATABASE after each round, linking entries by pattern ID to keep institutional memory fresh.  
- **Challenge Round playbook:** Provide adversarial questions per pattern (e.g., “What if Article 4 removes MA?”) so Round 5 explicitly pressure-tests the chosen filters.

---

## SUMMARY

**Top 3 Improvements Needed:**  
1. Map every pattern/sub-pattern to concrete SearchLand presets and add missing presets (Class ZA, SHLAA gaps, nutrient neutrality).  
2. Introduce structural navigation aids—pattern index, tags, and round-based decision trees—to reduce lookup time and align with collaborative workflow.  
3. Expand motivation/regulation coverage (leasehold reversions, nutrient credits, brand covenants) to capture uncovered strategies from the 86 presets.

**Confidence in Current Patterns:** Medium — several are actionable, but missing presets and vague filters risk misapplication.

**Would You Use This Document?** With changes — I need the preset mapping and round guides before relying on it in live searches.

**Overall Grade:** B-

=== UPDATED POSITIONS AFTER ITERATION ===

Loaded cached credentials.
### Disagreement 1: Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage) - Classification & Priority

**My Original Position:** Ranked #10 (low priority); stated it's "not a *filter* pattern" but a "workflow"; recommended moving it out of the patterns list entirely into an "Advanced Workflow" section.
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Ranked #3 (high priority); treats it as a legitimate pattern with "high ROI"; states it "converts SearchLand's daily refresh into unique deal flow."

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- I have changed my mind. I was too focused on the taxonomic purity of the list and incorrectly conflated its classification as a "workflow" with it having low importance.
- Codex is right to rank its value at #3. The argument that it "converts SearchLand's daily refresh into unique deal flow" is the single most important strategic insight in the entire document. My low ranking was a mistake.
- The best solution is a synthesis of both positions: I was right about *what* it is (a workflow), but Codex was right about *how valuable* it is. It should be separated structurally, but its importance must be highlighted.

**FINAL POSITION:** I will adopt a synthesized position. I maintain that Pattern 13 should be moved out of the flat list of filter patterns and into its own "Advanced Workflow" or "Meta-Strategy" section, as I originally proposed. However, I was wrong to rank it as low priority. This new section should be given top-level prominence in the document, and its description should explicitly state that it is one of the highest ROI strategies, reflecting Codex's #3 ranking.

---

### Disagreement 2: Pattern 11 (Strategic Land Promotion) - Structural Organization

**My Original Position:** Suggested merging Pattern 11 with Pattern 9B, stating the category felt redundant and should be consolidated.
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Treats Pattern 11 as a standalone category needing expansion, recommending the addition of "sub-patterns for SHLAA omissions and legacy estates."

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- I was wrong. My attempt to merge the patterns was an oversimplification that would have destroyed valuable nuance.
- Codex's position is more robust. "Strategic Land Promotion" is a deep and distinct field from "Green Belt Workarounds." While they can overlap, they are not the same. Codex's suggestion to expand Pattern 11 with more sub-patterns (like SHLAA omissions) proves that the category has enough substance to stand on its own.
- Merging them would make the document less useful for specialists focused on long-term land promotion.

**FINAL POSITION:** I have changed my mind and fully adopt Codex's position. Pattern 11 should remain a standalone category. Furthermore, it should be expanded as Codex suggests to include sub-patterns for SHLAA omissions and other related strategies, making it a more comprehensive and useful section. My original position was incorrect.

## Pattern 11: Strategic Land Strategies

**Clarity:** Somewhat Clear  
**Completeness:** Missing Details  
**Usefulness:** Useful  

**Strengths:**  
- Highlights emerging allocations with no planning and large employment allocations (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1053`).  
- Provides option-cost guidance (£10k-£50k) which helps scoping.

**Weaknesses:**  
- Ignores other strategic presets (edge-of-settlement #13/#18, unallocated no SHLAA #85/#86) that broaden the funnel (`SearchlandContext/PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md:205-222` and `845-857`).

232:### **Pattern 11: Strategic Land Promotion**
239:- Correctly identifies the "first mover" advantage of targeting emerging allocations with no planning yet (Pattern 11A).
242:- This pattern category feels redundant. Pattern 11A is very similar to Pattern 9B. They are both about promoting land for allocation. They should be merged or more clearly differentiated.

246:- **Merge Pattern 11A into 9B.** Rename Pattern 9 to "Strategic Land & Green Belt" and have two sub-patterns: 9A (Grey Belt) and 9B (Land Promotion), where 9B combines the insights from the current 9B and 11A.
247:- Keep Pattern 11B but move it under the new merged category, perhaps as "Pattern 9C: Strategic Employment Land".

### **Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies**

**Clarity:** Clear  
**Completeness:** Complete  
**Usefulness:** Highly Useful (conceptually)  

**Strengths:**
- This is a brilliant, high-level strategic concept. It correctly identifies that the 24-hour refresh cycle of SearchLand creates a window of opportunity.
- The examples (Fresh Planning Consent, Lease Expiry Pre-Contact) are concrete and illustrate the value of speed.

**Weaknesses:**
- This is not a *filter* pattern. It's a *workflow* or *process* that sits on top of other filter patterns. It requires external automation (scripts, alerts) that are outside the scope of SearchLand itself.
- It's presented as a pattern, but it's really a meta-strategy for *how to use* the other patterns.

**Suggested Improvements:**
- **Move this entire section.** Create a new top-level section in the document called "Advanced Workflow: Time & Information Arbitrage" or move it into the "Structure & Usability" part of the review. It doesn't belong in the list of filter patterns.
- Reframe it as a "how-to" guide for setting up a monitoring system that leverages the other patterns.

**Your Usage:** I would use this *process* every single day. But I wouldn't look for it in a list of *filter patterns*. The concept is A-grade, but its placement is confusing.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)

**Composing detailed final positions document**

I'm preparing a structured final response with two main sections addressing Pattern 13 and Pattern 11, referencing specific lines in the review files. I'll clearly outline original stances, reconsiderations citing relevant documents, and final positions with reasoning for reclassification and merging, ensuring proper formatting with headings and bullet points as requested.
codex
### Disagreement: Pattern 13 Classification & Priority

**My Original Position:** I treated Time/Information Arbitrage as a core filter pattern, ranked it #3 overall, and recommended incremental detail (templates, prioritisation) while keeping it inside the pattern list (`Review_Codex.md:1125-1145`, `Review_Codex.md:1266-1280`).  
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Gemini argues the section is actually a workflow layer that should be moved out of the numbered patterns into an “Advanced Workflow: Real-Time Monitoring” area (`Review_Gemini.md:274-292`, `Review_Gemini.md:447-459`).

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- After re-reading the source, 80% of Pattern 13 documents export cadence, diffing, alerts, and response protocols rather than new filter stacks (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1281-1396`). The only SearchLand-specific instructions simply point back to earlier filters (planning status, lease expiry) and then shift into tooling requirements, confirming Gemini’s point that this is meta-process, not a standalone pattern inventoried alongside, say, Green Belt proxies.
- Keeping it in the ranked list caused me to overstate its independence and inflate its priority relative to genuine filter combinations. Relocating it clarifies taxonomy while still preserving its high ROI content. I’ll advocate for a dedicated “Advanced Workflow” annex that references the relevant patterns (e.g., cite Patterns 2, 8, 12 wherever the arbitrage triggers rely on their filters) plus provide the export/alert stack there.
- My updated ranking drops the numeric slot and instead calls out the workflow as a “force multiplier” attached to whichever pattern you’re monitoring. This mirrors Gemini’s placement request but keeps the emphasis on use.

**FINAL POSITION:** Time/Information Arbitrage should move out of the 13-pattern list into an “Advanced Workflow” section that cross-references the underlying filters; it remains strategically vital but should no longer hold a numbered rank.

---

### Disagreement: Pattern 11 vs. Pattern 9B (Strategic Land Organisation)

**My Original Position:** I argued Pattern 11 needed expansion (extra SHLAA/edge presets, Local Plan workflow) and should remain a standalone category for land-promotion strategies (`Review_Codex.md:1077-1097`).  
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Gemini sees Pattern 11A as redundant with Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement Promotion) and recommends merging them under a single “Strategic Land & Green Belt” category, folding 11B in as a sub-pattern as well (`Review_Gemini.md:232-249`).

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- Pattern 9B already covers settlement-edge, unallocated land with SHLAA context (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:664-724`). Pattern 11A then repeats the same plot size, option, and plan-promotion logic but tags it as “Emerging allocations” (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1014`). The distinction I thought existed (allocated vs. unallocated) isn’t surfaced in the current taxonomy; both live under separate top-level categories despite serving the same “promote land into the Local Plan” workflow.
- Gemini’s consolidation removes this duplication and matches how agents decide in practice: first pick whether you’re chasing policy-backed Green Belt exceptions (Pattern 9A at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:608-663`) or land-promotion plays, then drill into sub-patterns for unallocated edges (current 9B) versus newly allocated parcels (current 11A) versus strategic employment (current 11B at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1017-1053`). That hierarchy is clearer than maintaining two disjointed sections.
- I still want the extra guidance I called for (Local Plan timelines, infra costs), but that content can live inside the merged “Strategic Land Promotion” cluster. There’s no benefit to keeping duplicate headings, so I’m adopting Gemini’s structural proposal and will focus my follow-up edits on enriching the consolidated section.

**FINAL POSITION:** Merge Pattern 11A with Pattern 9B under a single “Strategic Land & Green Belt” category (sub-patterns for grey-belt exceptions, edge promotion/unallocated, emerging allocations, and strategic employment), then add the missing process guidance inside that unified section rather than keeping two overlapping top-level patterns.

Relocating it clarifies taxonomy while still preserving its high ROI content. I’ll advocate for a dedicated “Advanced Workflow” annex that references the relevant patterns (e.g., cite Patterns 2, 8, 12 wherever the arbitrage triggers rely on their filters) plus provide the export/alert stack there.
- My updated ranking drops the numeric slot and instead calls out the workflow as a “force multiplier” attached to whichever pattern you’re monitoring. This mirrors Gemini’s placement request but keeps the emphasis on use.

**FINAL POSITION:** Time/Information Arbitrage should move out of the 13-pattern list into an “Advanced Workflow” section that cross-references the underlying filters; it remains strategically vital but should no longer hold a numbered rank.

### Disagreement: Pattern 11 vs. Pattern 9B (Strategic Land Organisation)

**My Original Position:** I argued Pattern 11 needed expansion (extra SHLAA/edge presets, Local Plan workflow) and should remain a standalone category for land-promotion strategies (`Review_Codex.md:1077-1097`).  
**Other Reviewer's Position:** Gemini sees Pattern 11A as redundant with Pattern 9B (Edge of Settlement Promotion) and recommends merging them under a single “Strategic Land & Green Belt” category, folding 11B in as a sub-pattern as well (`Review_Gemini.md:232-249`).

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- Pattern 9B already covers settlement-edge, unallocated land with SHLAA context (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:664-724`). Pattern 11A then repeats the same plot size, option, and plan-promotion logic but tags it as “Emerging allocations” (`FILTER_PATTERNS.md:960-1014`). The distinction I thought existed (allocated vs. unallocated) isn’t surfaced in the current taxonomy; both live under separate top-level categories despite serving the same “promote land into the Local Plan” workflow.
- Gemini’s consolidation removes this duplication and matches how agents decide in practice: first pick whether you’re chasing policy-backed Green Belt exceptions (Pattern 9A at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:608-663`) or land-promotion plays, then drill into sub-patterns for unallocated edges (current 9B) versus newly allocated parcels (current 11A) versus strategic employment (current 11B at `FILTER_PATTERNS.md:1017-1053`). That hierarchy is clearer than maintaining two disjointed sections.
- I still want the extra guidance I called for (Local Plan timelines, infra costs), but that content can live inside the merged “Strategic Land Promotion” cluster. There’s no benefit to keeping duplicate headings, so I’m adopting Gemini’s structural proposal and will focus my follow-up edits on enriching the consolidated section.

**FINAL POSITION:** Merge Pattern 11A with Pattern 9B under a single “Strategic Land & Green Belt” category (sub-patterns for grey-belt exceptions, edge promotion/unallocated, emerging allocations, and strategic employment), then add the missing process guidance inside that unified section rather than keeping two overlapping top-level patterns.

NOTE: Use the UPDATED positions above when they exist. Iteration happened because of disagreements.

## 9. Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: Grey Belt Exception
```
Strategy: Previously developed land in Green Belt (exception to protection)
Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

Strengths:
- Access to Green Belt locations (often cheaper)
- Exception to normal GB restrictions
- Less competition (many avoid GB entirely)

Weaknesses:
- Still needs planning (not automatic)
- Local opposition possible
- Must prove "previously developed"

Capital requirement: Often cheaper than pure urban (£50k-£300k)

Example Filters:

Grey Belt (Preset #7):
1. Freehold tenure
2. More than 25% area developed
3. More than 10% hardstanding (key indicator)
4. Within 100m of built up area
5. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3, National parks, Conservation area, etc.
6. 1,000+ sqmt

Grey Belt Low Impact (Preset #44):

2. More than 25% hardstanding
3. Within 100m of built up area
4. NOT: Flood zone 3, Conservation area, AONB

Strategic Insight:
"Previously developed land in Green Belt" = exception
Hardstanding % = proxy for "previously developed"

Related: Presets #7, #43, #44, #45 (GB solar)
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "Hardstanding percentage"
```

### Pattern B: Edge of Settlement Promotion
```
Strategy: Sites on settlement edges for local plan inclusion
Source: SearchLand Presets #13, #18, #85, #86
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Within 50-200m of adopted/emerging settlement boundary
- NOT allocated (yet) - promotion opportunity
- NOT SHLAA assessed OR negative (hidden gems)
- Private owner (easier to deal)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 5% developed (undeveloped land)

Strategic Rationale:
- Local authorities review settlement boundaries periodically
- Sites on edges = natural expansion direction
- No SHLAA = no one else promoting (first mover advantage)
- Promote to get allocated in next local plan

Strengths:
- Lower competition (undiscovered)
- Can influence local plan
- Option agreements with minimal capital
- Value jump when allocated

Weaknesses:
- Long timeline (2-5 years for allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation
- Requires planning expertise

Capital requirement: Low for option (£5k-£50k), patient capital

Example Filters:

Edge of Settlement (Preset #18):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Private owner ownership
3. 1,000-8,000 sqmt
4. Less than 5% area developed
5. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no activity)
6. No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
7. 1-10% built up area coverage (edge location)
8. More than 80% un-constrained

Un-Allocated No SHLAA (Preset #85):
1. NOT SHLAA positive/neutral/negative (not assessed!)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m of settlement boundary
4. Company or private owner
5. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)

Strategy:
1. Identify edge-of-settlement sites
2. Secure option agreement (low capital)
3. Promote to local authority (planning consultancy)
4. Get allocated in local plan
5. Apply for planning permission
6. Exit to housebuilder

Related: Presets #13, #18, #85, #86

## 10. Renewable Energy Opportunities ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: Solar Ground Mount (Agricultural Land)
```
Strategy: Large-scale solar farms on lower-grade agricultural land
Source: SearchLand Presets #14, #81
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Freehold tenure
- 40,000+ sqmt (10 acres minimum, typically 20-100 acres)
- Less than 5% area developed (flat, open land)
- Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (NOT Grade 1-2 = planning objection)
- Within 2,000m of green rated substation (grid connection)
- 75%+ area un-constrained
- Corporate/company/private owner

Strategic Rationale:
- Solar requires: Large area, flat land, grid connection
- Grade 1-2 = "Best & Most Versatile" (BMV) → planning refusal
- Grade 3b/4 = lower quality → planning easier
- Green rated substation = capacity available NOW

Strengths:
- Proven revenue model (20-25 year offtake agreements)
- Land lease income for farmers (passive income)
- Planning policy support (renewable targets)
- Lower grade land = less objections

Weaknesses:
- Large capital (£500k-£5M+ for development)
- Grid connection costs if >2km
- Planning can still be refused (local opposition)
- Long development timeline (12-24 months)

Capital requirement:
- Option: £10k-£50k
- Development: £500k per acre (equipment + grid)
- Often project-financed

Revenue Model:
- Lease to solar operator: £800-£1,200/acre/year
- Or develop + sell to operator
- 25-year income stream

Example Filter (Preset #14):
1. Freehold tenure
2. 40,000 sqmt or more
3. Less than 5% area developed
4. Within 2,000m of green rated substation ⚠️ CRITICAL

- 0 leaseholds (owner-occupied = decision maker)
- SIC codes: Target specific industries (paper, poultry, manufacturing)

Strategic Rationale:
- Industrial = high energy bills = strong solar ROI
- Owner-occupied = no landlord/tenant split incentive
- Large roofs = economies of scale
- Flat roof = lower install cost

Strengths:
- Clear ROI for owner (energy savings)
- Long-term stable income (20+ years)
- Owner-occupied = easier to deal
- Large projects = better margins

Weaknesses:
- Structural surveys required
- Some roofs unsuitable (age, condition)
- Capital intensive

Capital requirement:
- £50k-£500k depending on roof size
- Often financed/PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)

Target Industries (SIC Codes):

### Pattern C: Battery Storage (BESS) & Hydrogen
```
Strategy: Energy storage near substations (grid balancing)
Source: SearchLand Presets #51 (BESS), #55 (Hydrogen), #52 (Bio-energy)
Discovered: 2025-11-19

BESS (Battery Energy Storage Systems):
- 20,000-400,000 sqmt (large sites)
- Within 2,000m green rated substation
- 75%+ flat terrain (easier construction)
- Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4
- Less than 5% developed

Hydrogen Sites:
- 8,000-20,000 sqmt (smaller than BESS)
- Within 200m of substation (high power demand!)
- >500m from schools/hospitals/care homes/built-up (safety)
- NOT Flood zone 2/3, AONB

Strategic Rationale:
- Grid needs storage (renewable intermittency)
- BESS: Store excess, release at peak (arbitrage)
- Hydrogen: Energy vector for heavy industry/transport
- Government incentives/subsidies available

Strengths:
- Growing market (renewable targets)
- Long-term stable contracts
- Grid-critical infrastructure

Weaknesses:
- Complex technology
- Safety concerns (hydrogen)
- Planning objections possible
- High capital (£5M-£50M+)

Capital requirement: Institutional (£5M+), often project finance

Example Filter - BESS (Preset #51):
1. Freehold tenure
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt
3. Less than 5% area developed
4. Within 2,000m green rated substation
5. 75%+ flat terrain
6. Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4

Example Filter - Hydrogen (Preset #55):
1. Freehold tenure
2. 8,000-20,000 sqmt
3. Within 200m of substation (VERY close!)
4. >500m from sensitive uses (safety buffer)
5. NOT Flood zone 2/3

```

### Pattern D: Wind Farm Land
```
Strategy: Large agricultural sites for onshore wind
Source: SearchLand Preset #56
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Freehold tenure

- Less than 5% developed
- Within 2,000m green rated substation
- Agricultural Grade 3/3a/3b/4 (NOT 1-2)
- >500m from built-up area (noise/visual impact)
- 75%+ un-constrained

Strategic Rationale:
- Wind requires: Large open area, away from housing, grid connection
- Agricultural land continues farming (turbines on small footprint)
- Planning harder than solar (visual impact, noise)

Strengths:
- High output per turbine
- Land lease income (£5k-£10k per turbine/year)
- Farming continues

Weaknesses:
- Planning very difficult (local opposition)
- Visual impact concerns
- Noise regulations
- Expensive (£2M-£4M per turbine)

Capital requirement: Institutional (£5M+ per project)

Example Filter (Preset #56):
1. Freehold tenure
2. 20,000-400,000 sqmt
3. Less than 5% developed
4. Within 2,000m green rated substation

## 12. Commercial Traffic-Dependent ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: High-Footfall Retail Opportunities
```
Strategy: Retail sites with quantified footfall (viability proven)
Source: SearchLand Presets #27, #46
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Average daily footfall: 800+ (viable), 6,000+ (prime)
- Use class: E(a) retail display
- Lease end date optional (motivation signal)
- 325+ sqmt

Strategic Rationale:
- Footfall = revenue potential (quantified)
- High footfall = supports premium rents
- Expiring leases = motivated landlords

Strengths:
- Data-driven (footfall quantified)
- Commercial viability proven
- High footfall = lower vacancy risk

Weaknesses:
- Competitive (everyone wants high footfall)
- Premium pricing

Capital requirement: £200k-£2M+ depending on location

Footfall Thresholds:

- Within 400m of A road
- 1,000-20,000 sqmt
- 30% or less area developed (room for construction)
- For EV: Within 5,000m green rated substation (power supply)

Strategic Rationale:
- Vehicle count = customer volume (quantified)
- 10,000+ vehicles/day = viable for petrol/drive-thru/EV
- Major road proximity = visibility

Strengths:
- Data-driven viability
- Clear revenue model
- Growing markets (especially EV)

Weaknesses:
- Competitive locations
- Planning may be difficult (traffic concerns)

Capital requirement: £500k-£5M depending on use

Vehicle Count Thresholds:

## Strategy Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern:

**Budget-Driven:**
- <£50k → Option Agreement, Airspace Rights
- £50k-£200k → Sub-£200k Direct, Derelict Turnaround
- £200k-£500k → Under-Developed + Accessibility, Stalled Planning
- >£500k → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Low risk → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations
- Medium risk → Stalled Planning, Under-Developed Sites
- High risk → Derelict Turnaround, Airspace Development

**Timeline:**
- Fast (<12 months) → Existing Approvals, Option Exercise
- Medium (12-24 months) → Stalled Planning Revival, Turnarounds
- Long (24+ months) → Greenfield Development, Strategic Allocations

**Expertise Required:**
- Low → Sub-£200k Direct Purchase, Simple Turnarounds
- Medium → Stalled Planning, Motivated Sellers
- High → Airspace Development, Tall Buildings, Strategic Sites

---

## Combining Patterns

### Example: "Mixed-Use 8-Storey £2M Profit on £200k Capital"

**Possible Approach Combinations:**

1. **Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A) + Motivated Seller (Pattern 2A)**
   - Find stalled mixed-use planning with corporate seller motivation
   - Low acquisition cost, planning precedent exists
   - Capital: option agreement or distressed purchase

2. **Under-Developed (Pattern 3A) + Airspace (Pattern 6A)**
   - High PTAL, flat roof, existing low-rise
   - Add 4-6 storeys of residential above
   - Capital: airspace rights + construction finance

3. **Derelict Turnaround (Pattern 4C) + Height Intensification (Pattern 5A)**
   - Derelict building in tall building zone
   - Demolish + rebuild to 8 storeys
   - Capital: acquisition + phased construction

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

---

## 13. Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies ⭐ NEW

**Core Concept:** SearchLand refreshes data every 24 hours. Speed advantage = profit advantage.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)
- Time arbitrage = price arbitrage
```

### Pattern 13B: Fresh Planning Consent Alert
```
Strategy: Contact owner same day planning consent granted
Indicators:
- Planning status: Approved (filter)
- Decision date: Last 7 days (custom monitoring)
- Your action: Call owner immediately

Example Script:
"Congratulations on your consent. I have a buyer ready to move. 
Would £580k interest you?" (Owner unaware of £650k market value)

Profit: £70k in 48 hours (user example)

Strengths: Maximum information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires daily monitoring, fast response capability
Capital: Option agreement or cash purchase ready
```

### Pattern 13C: Lease Expiry Pre-Contact (90-Day Window)
```
Strategy: Contact owner 90 days before lease expiry (before void period)
Indicators:
- Lease end date: 60-120 days from today
- Use class: Commercial (E, B2, B8)
- Your offer: "Avoid void period, we have buyers ready"

Owner Psychology:
- 90 days out: Starting to worry about vacancy
- 30 days out: Panicking about lost income
- Post-expiry: Maximum pressure (carrying costs, no income)

Profit Source: Buy at "pre-panic" price, sell at market
```

### Pattern 13D: New Allocation Alert (Local Plan)
```
Strategy: Contact owner when site added to local plan allocations
Indicators:
- Housing allocation: Emerging (NEW)
- Applications in last 5 years: 0 (owner unaware)
- Your action: "Your site just got allocated—let's discuss before agent calls"

Example:
Day 1: SearchLand shows site added to emerging allocations
Day 1 (same day): You call owner offering £300k
Owner thinks: "My land was worth £150k yesterday, £300k is amazing!"
Reality: Market value post-allocation = £500k
Your profit: £200k by being first

Strengths: Massive information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires immediate action (speed critical)
```

### Pattern 13E: Fast Food Lease Expiry (High Visibility)
```
Strategy: Target high-footfall commercial with expiring leases
Indicators:
- Use class: E (restaurants/retail)
- Lease end date: Last 30 days (just expired)
- Footfall count: >2000/day (high value)
- Your action: Contact landlord (now in void period, cash flow pressure)

Why This Works:
- High footfall = high value but landlord may not realize
- Void period = immediate cash flow pressure
- Can offer "quick sale to avoid prolonged void"

Buyers: Fast food chains, convenience stores (high footfall valuable)
```

### Implementation Requirements

**System Setup:**
1. **Daily Automated Exports**
   - Export target filter results as CSV/JSON
   - Store with timestamp
   - Compare today vs yesterday (diff script)

2. **Alert Triggers**
   - New properties added: Email notification
   - Status changes: SMS + Email
   - Approaching thresholds (e.g., 90 days to lease expiry): Weekly digest

3. **Response Protocol**
   - Same-day contact for fresh consents
   - Script templates for different scenarios
   - Cash/option ready to move fast

**Tools Needed:**
- SearchLand API (or automated export)
- Diff comparison script (Python/Node)
- Email/SMS alerting system
- CRM for tracking contacts

### Capital Strategy

**Speed Capital:**
- Keep £50k-£200k liquid for immediate deployment
- Option agreements (£10k-£50k) for fast control
- Bridging finance arranged in advance (no delays)

**Profit Model:**
- Time arbitrage: Buy at "uninformed" price, sell at "informed" price
- Typical spread: 10-30% (£50k-£200k on £500k deal)
- Volume strategy: 10-20 deals/year = £500k-£2M profit

### Strengths
1. **Information asymmetry:** You know before owner/market
2. **No competition:** Pre-market, no agents, no bidders
3. **Premium pricing:** Buyers pay for exclusivity
4. **Scalable:** Automated monitoring, repeatable process
5. **High ROI:** Low capital, high profit margins

### Weaknesses
1. **Requires daily monitoring:** Labor-intensive or requires automation
2. **Speed critical:** Miss by 1 day = opportunity lost
3. **Competitive advantage erodes:** Once others adopt same strategy
4. **SearchLand dependency:** 24hr refresh only (not real-time)
5. **Execution risk:** Owner may not want to sell, buyer may back out

### Example Deal Flow

**Day 1 Morning:**
- SearchLand export shows planning consent granted yesterday
- Property: 4-unit scheme, Camden, owner-occupied

**Day 1 Afternoon:**
- Call owner: "Congratulations! I have a buyer at £580k, quick completion"
- Owner (unaware of £650k market value): "Yes, that sounds great!"

**Day 2:**
- Option agreement signed (£10k, 30-day exercise)
- Call buyer network: "Fresh consent, Camden, 4 units, £650k"
- Buyer: "Pre-vetted, no competition? Yes."

**Day 3-30:**
- Due diligence, legal, exercise option
- Completion: You buy £580k, sell £650k
- **Net profit: £60k** (after legals/costs)

**Annualized: 10 deals = £600k profit from speed arbitrage alone**

---

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

---

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### ❌ Over-Constraining
```
Problem: Combining too many restrictive filters
Example: Applications = 0 AND Price <£200k AND Derelict AND On-market AND PTAL 6a
Result: 0 results (filters compound restrictiveness)
Solution: Test incrementally, use separate filter groups for different approaches
```

### ❌ Geographic Mismatches
```
Problem: Using London-specific filters (PTAL) for UK-wide searches
Example: PTAL filter outside TfL area
Result: 0 results
Solution: Create separate approaches for London vs rest of UK
```

### ❌ Assuming Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem: Designing strategy around filters that don't exist
Example: "Planning Status: Expired" or "Price Reduced"
Result: Cannot implement strategy
Solution: Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md first
```

- **Owner-occupied:** Easier than landlord/tenant (split incentive)
- **SIC code targeting:** Paper, poultry, manufacturing = high energy bills

**Strategic Insights - Other Renewable:**
- **Substation proximity CRITICAL:** <2km for solar/wind/BESS, <200m for hydrogen
- **Green rated substation:** Must have capacity (grid connection expensive if not)
- **Safety buffers:** Hydrogen >500m from schools/hospitals/care homes
- **Scale:** All require large capital (institutional investors)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A-10D

### Category 4: Regulation-Driven Opportunities - 6 Presets

**Strategy:** Regulation forces owner action (motivates sale)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 12 | HMO expired licenses | HMO license expired | Cannot operate legally | £100k-£400k |
| 17 | Commercial expiring leases | Lease ends <2027, B2/B8/E, stale | Income cliff approaching | £200k-£1M+ |
| 41 | Fast food expired leases | E(b) food/drink, lease expired | Income ended | £100k-£500k |
| 46 | High footfall lease expiry | 6k+ footfall, lease 6-12m | Prime location, motivated | £500k-£3M+ |
| 66 | Office blocks expiring | E(g) offices, lease <2026 | Income ending | £300k-£2M+ |
| 78 | Single flats expiring leases | C3 flat, lease <2099, 1 address | Lease running out | £50k-£300k |

**Additional EPC-Related (implicit regulation):**

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2 | Run down homes | EPC E/F/G, detached, <30% developed | Cannot rent legally | £100k-£400k |
| 20 | Unsold poor EPC | EPC E/F/G, sold before 2004 (20+ years!) | Cannot rent + tired owner | £50k-£300k |
| 36 | ECO4 | EPC E/F/G, 5+ addresses, private owner | Grant-eligible improvements | £200k-£1M |
| 47 | HMO opportunities | 8-12 rooms, low EPC, sold before 2014 | Conversion + improvement needed | £150k-£500k |
| 67 | Offices low EPC | EPC D/E/F/G, E commercial, office type | High energy costs | £200k-£1M+ |
| 69 | Older houses outdoor space | No sold date, low EPC, no apps 5 years | Legacy holding + cannot rent | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **HMO licenses:** Expired = illegal to operate → forced renewal (£1k-£3k) or sale
- **Lease expiry:** 6-12 months = peak motivation (owner deciding)
- **Vacant post-expiry:** Strongest signal (no income, carrying costs)
- **EPC E-G:** Cannot rent in private sector since 2020 → improvement (£5k-£50k) or sale
- **Combine signals:** E.g., expired HMO license + low EPC = double motivation

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A-8C

### Category 5: Green Belt Strategies - 5 Presets

**Strategy:** Exploit "previously developed" and edge-of-settlement exceptions

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategic Rationale | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| 7 | Grey Belt | 25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding, GB, <100m built-up | Previously developed exception | £50k-£300k |
| 43 | GB sites with hardstanding | 1%+ GB, 1k-10k sqmt, built-up or <100m | Edge + previous development | £50k-£300k |

| 57 | Storage in Green Belt | Built-up, B2/B8, 0-20% developed, NOT GB (!?) | Note: Preset name misleading | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Previously developed land:** >10-30% hardstanding = brownfield status
- **Hardstanding = proxy:** Concrete/asphalt from demolished buildings, car parks
- **Edge of settlement:** <100m from built-up = less "green" objection
- **Green Belt Review scores:** 1-2 = low landscape/environmental value
- **Planning still required:** These are exceptions, not guarantees
- **Less competition:** Many developers avoid GB entirely (opportunity)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A-9B

| 26 | Allocated 5-50 acres | 20k-200k sqmt, employment allocation, <100m A/B road | Strategic employment land | £1M+ per acre |
| 38 | Emerging sites no planning | Emerging allocation, <1 app, 4k-40k sqmt | First mover advantage | £10k-£50k option |
| 63 | Planning 10-100 units | 8k+ sqmt, 10-100 dwellings applied, in settlement | Existing planning | £500k-£5M |
| 75 | Residential allocations | 4k-40k sqmt, housing/mixed allocation, private | Policy-backed sites | £100k-£1M+ |
| 85 | Un-allocated no SHLAA 1-10 acres | NOT SHLAA, NOT allocated, <50m settlement, 4k-40k sqmt | Hidden gems to promote | £10k-£50k option |
| 86 | Un-allocated private 4k+ sqmt | Private, 4k+ sqmt, NOT allocated, <200m settlement | Edge promotion | £10k-£50k option |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Emerging allocations (#38):** Allocated but no planning yet = first mover advantage
- **No SHLAA (#85, #86):** Not assessed by authority = hidden opportunity to promote
- **Edge of settlement:** <50-200m from boundary = natural expansion direction
- **"No latest sold date":** Never sold = inherited/legacy (may not know value)
- **Option agreements:** Low capital (£10k-£50k), control site, promote to LA
- **Timelines:** 2-5 years for allocation → planning → sale
- **Planning expertise:** Essential for promotion strategies

## Key Strategic Learnings from Presets

### 1. Motivation Signals (NEW - from Preset Analysis)

**Regulation-Driven (Strongest):**
- ⚠️ HMO License Expiry Date (cannot operate)
- ⚠️ Lease end date (income cliff)
- ⚠️ EPC E-G rating (cannot rent)

**Time-Based:**
- No latest sold date (never sold = legacy)
- Latest sold date >20 years ago
- <1 application in last 5 years (no activity)

**Corporate:**
- Company status: Liquidation (from user discovery)
- 30+ titles owned (portfolio divestment)

### 2. Previously Undocumented Filters

**From Preset Analysis:**
- `Hardstanding percentage` (proxy for previously developed)
- `Agricultural Land Grade` (energy project viability)
- `SHLAA status` (strategic land indicator)
- `Green Belt Review score` (environmental impact)
- `SIC codes` (industry targeting)
- `Average daily footfall` (commercial viability)
- `Average daily vehicle count` (traffic-dependent viability)
- `Distance to green rated substation` (energy projects)
- `EPC recommendations contains "solar"` (improvement suggestions)

### 3. Clever Filter Combinations

**ANY Logic (Accessibility):**
Preset #10 (Padel):
```
Within 400m of bus stop OR
Within 800m of train station OR
Within 5m of built up area
```
→ Flexible accessibility requirements

**Compound Targeting:**
Preset #7 (Grey Belt):
```
Green Belt location +
25%+ developed +
10%+ hardstanding +
Within 100m built-up +
NOT: [long list of absolute constraints]
```
→ Multiple signals = "previously developed in GB"

**Strategic Constraint Targeting:**
Preset #13 (Edge of Settlement):
```
1-99% green belt coverage OR
1-99% another constraint coverage
```
→ Targets edge cases (partially constrained = opportunity)

### 4. Threshold Insights

**Commercial Viability:**
- 800+ footfall = Viable cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = Prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = Viable petrol/drive-thru/EV

**Energy Projects:**
- <2,000m substation = Solar/wind/BESS viable
- <200m substation = Hydrogen viable (high power)
- <5,000m substation = EV charging viable

**Size Thresholds:**
- Class MA: <4,000 sqmt title
- Class G: <250 sqmt (only 2 flats)
- Solar ground mount: >40,000 sqmt (10 acres min)
- BESS: 20,000-400,000 sqmt (5-100 acres)

**Hardstanding (Previously Developed):**
- 10%+ = Minimal indicator
- 25-30%+ = Clear previously developed
- 40%+ = Significant (car parks)
