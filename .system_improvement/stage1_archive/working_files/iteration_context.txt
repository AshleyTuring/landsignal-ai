# ITERATION: Reconsider Your Review

You provided an initial review of FILTER_PATTERNS.md. Another reviewer (Gemini/Codex) has also provided their review.

## DISAGREEMENTS IDENTIFIED

[Disagreement analysis will be included below]

## YOUR TASK

For EACH disagreement where you're involved:

1. **Read the other reviewer's position carefully**
2. **Reconsider your position:**
   - Were you wrong? (Admit it and update)
   - Were they wrong? (Explain why you're sticking to your position)
   - Were you both partially right? (Propose a synthesis)
3. **Update your position if warranted**

## OUTPUT FORMAT

For each disagreement:

```
### Disagreement: [Topic]

**My Original Position:** [What I said]
**Other Reviewer's Position:** [What they said]

**Upon Reconsideration:**
- [Have I changed my mind? Why/why not?]
- [Updated position if changed]
- [If unchanged: Why I'm confident in original position]

**FINAL POSITION:** [Clear statement]
```

Be intellectually honest. If the other reviewer made a good point you missed, acknowledge it.
