# SYNTHESIS TASK - CHUNK 1 of 4

You are synthesizing improvements from peer reviews by Gemini and Codex.

## YOUR TASK
Create the **Front Matter + Patterns 1-3** of FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.0:

1. **Front Matter:**
   - Document title and overview
   - Table of Contents (12 core patterns + Advanced Workflow section)
   - Master Strategy Matrix (NEW - both reviewers requested this)
   - Collaborative Round Guide (NEW - maps patterns to rounds 2-5)
   - How to Use This Document

2. **Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning**
   - Incorporate Gemini's feedback (add thresholds, preset references)
   - Enhance clarity and completeness

3. **Pattern 2: Motivated Seller Strategies**
   - Keep existing sub-patterns 2A-2C
   - **ADD Pattern 2D: Liquidation/Administration Sales** (already exists in original)
   - Incorporate both reviewers' feedback

4. **Pattern 3: Development Opportunity Strategies**
   - Add preset references and concrete thresholds
   - Address Codex's feedback about missing preset mapping

## KEY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT

### Master Strategy Matrix (NEW)
Create a table with these columns:
| Pattern # | Pattern Name | Capital Required | Risk Level | Timeline | Best For |

Include all 12 patterns (note: Pattern 11 merged into Pattern 9)

### Collaborative Round Guide (NEW)
Map patterns to collaborative exploration rounds:
- **Round 2: Precedent** - Which patterns help replicate planning application?
- **Round 3: Regulation** - Which patterns exploit regulatory drivers?
- **Round 4: Structural** - Which patterns exploit physical constraints?
- **Round 5: Behavioral** - Which patterns exploit seller motivation?

### Pattern 13 Note
In the Table of Contents, note that Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage) has been **moved to "Advanced Workflow" section** at the end (will be in Chunk 4).

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Output the full enhanced text for this chunk (approximately 3,000-4,000 lines).
Include all markdown formatting, code blocks, bullet points, etc.

DO NOT output a summary - output the ACTUAL enhanced document text.
