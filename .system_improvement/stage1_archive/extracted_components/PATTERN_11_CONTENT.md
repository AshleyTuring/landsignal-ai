## 11. Strategic Land Promotion ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: Emerging Allocations (Pre-Planning)
```
Strategy: Sites allocated in emerging local plans, no planning yet (first mover)
Source: SearchLand Preset #38
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Housing allocation (emerging) OR Mixed allocation (emerging)
- Less than 1 max dwellings applied for (NO planning yet)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 3% area developed
- Freehold tenure

Strategic Rationale:
- Emerging allocation = council committed to housing here
- No planning yet = can be FIRST to apply
- First mover advantage: Shape scheme, get allocation certainty
- Value jump when planning granted

Strengths:
- Policy backing (allocated in plan)
- Lower competition (not yet discovered by housebuilders)
- Can secure option before planning (low capital)
- Planning risk reduced (policy support)

Weaknesses:
- Emerging = not yet adopted (could change)
- Still needs planning permission
- Section 106 obligations likely

Capital requirement:
- Option: £10k-£50k
- Planning costs: £50k-£200k
- Exit to housebuilder at planning stage

Strategy:
1. Identify emerging allocations with no planning
2. Secure option agreement with landowner
3. Apply for planning (first in)
4. Sell to housebuilder with consent

Example Filter (Preset #38):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Housing allocation (emerging)
3. Less than 1 max dwellings applied for
4. 4,000-40,000 sqmt
5. Less than 3% area developed

Best For:
- Land promoters
- Option traders
- Planning consultancies

### Pattern B: Strategic Allocated Land (5-50 Acres)
```
Strategy: Large employment/mixed-use allocations near major roads
Source: SearchLand Preset #26
Discovered: 2025-11-19

- Less than 10% developed
- Employment allocation OR Employment allocation (emerging)
- Within 100m of A road OR Within 100m of B road (accessibility)

Strategic Rationale:
- Large strategic sites for employment/logistics
- Major road access = commercial viability
- Local authority allocated = policy support

Strengths:
- Policy-backed
- Commercial buyers (logistics, industrial)
- Large scale (meaningful projects)

Weaknesses:
- High capital required (£1M-£20M)
- Long timelines
- Infrastructure requirements

Capital requirement: Institutional (£1M+ per acre)

Example Filter (Preset #26):
1. 20,000-200,000 sqmt
2. Less than 10% developed
3. Employment allocation or emerging
4. Within 100m of A road OR B road

## 12. Commercial Traffic-Dependent ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: High-Footfall Retail Opportunities
```
Strategy: Retail sites with quantified footfall (viability proven)
Source: SearchLand Presets #27, #46
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Average daily footfall: 800+ (viable), 6,000+ (prime)
- Use class: E(a) retail display
- Lease end date optional (motivation signal)
- 325+ sqmt

Strategic Rationale:
- Footfall = revenue potential (quantified)
- High footfall = supports premium rents
- Expiring leases = motivated landlords

Strengths:
- Data-driven (footfall quantified)
- Commercial viability proven
- High footfall = lower vacancy risk

Weaknesses:
- Competitive (everyone wants high footfall)
- Premium pricing

Capital requirement: £200k-£2M+ depending on location

Footfall Thresholds:
- 800+ = Viable for cafe/restaurant
- 2,000+ = Good retail
- 6,000+ = Prime retail (Preset #46)

Example Filter - Cafe Sites (Preset #27):
1. 800+ average daily footfall
2. E(a) retail display
3. 325+ sqmt
4. Demographics: specific targeting

Example Filter - Prime Retail Expiring (Preset #46):
1. 6,000+ average daily footfall (prime!)
2. Lease end date: 30/09/2025 to 30/09/2026 (motivation)
3. E(a) retail or Retail use class

Best For:
- Retail operators
- Restaurant chains
- Landlords/investors

Related: Presets #27, #46
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "Footfall / Vehicle Count"
```

### Pattern B: High-Traffic Drive-Thru/EV Sites
```
Strategy: Sites with high vehicle counts for drive-thru, petrol, EV chargers
Source: SearchLand Presets #54, #58, #72, #84
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Average daily vehicle count: 10,000+ (minimum viable)
- Within 400m of A road
- 1,000-20,000 sqmt
- 30% or less area developed (room for construction)
- For EV: Within 5,000m green rated substation (power supply)

Strategic Rationale:
- Vehicle count = customer volume (quantified)
- 10,000+ vehicles/day = viable for petrol/drive-thru/EV
- Major road proximity = visibility

Strengths:
- Data-driven viability
- Clear revenue model
- Growing markets (especially EV)

Weaknesses:
- Competitive locations
- Planning may be difficult (traffic concerns)

Capital requirement: £500k-£5M depending on use

Vehicle Count Thresholds:
- 10,000+ daily = Minimum viable (Presets #54, #58, #72)
- Higher = better (more customers)

Example Filter - EV Charging (Preset #54):
1. 10,000+ average daily vehicle count
2. Within 400m of A road
3. Within 5,000m green rated substation (power)
4. Car park/petrol station/restaurant use
5. >1,000m from existing EV charger (avoid competition)

### Pattern C: Niche Commercial Markets
```
Strategy: Specific commercial uses with defined criteria
Source: SearchLand Presets (Padel #10/#70, Care Homes #28)
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Care Homes:
- 4,000+ sqmt
- ≤10% developed (room for building)

## Strategy Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Pattern:

**Budget-Driven:**
- <£50k → Option Agreement, Airspace Rights
- £50k-£200k → Sub-£200k Direct, Derelict Turnaround
- £200k-£500k → Under-Developed + Accessibility, Stalled Planning
- >£500k → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations

**Risk Tolerance:**
- Low risk → Existing Approvals, Strategic Allocations
- Medium risk → Stalled Planning, Under-Developed Sites
- High risk → Derelict Turnaround, Airspace Development

**Timeline:**
- Fast (<12 months) → Existing Approvals, Option Exercise
- Medium (12-24 months) → Stalled Planning Revival, Turnarounds
- Long (24+ months) → Greenfield Development, Strategic Allocations

**Expertise Required:**
- Low → Sub-£200k Direct Purchase, Simple Turnarounds
- Medium → Stalled Planning, Motivated Sellers
- High → Airspace Development, Tall Buildings, Strategic Sites

---

## Combining Patterns

### Example: "Mixed-Use 8-Storey £2M Profit on £200k Capital"

**Possible Approach Combinations:**

1. **Stalled Planning (Pattern 1A) + Motivated Seller (Pattern 2A)**
   - Find stalled mixed-use planning with corporate seller motivation
   - Low acquisition cost, planning precedent exists
   - Capital: option agreement or distressed purchase

2. **Under-Developed (Pattern 3A) + Airspace (Pattern 6A)**
   - High PTAL, flat roof, existing low-rise
   - Add 4-6 storeys of residential above
   - Capital: airspace rights + construction finance

3. **Derelict Turnaround (Pattern 4C) + Height Intensification (Pattern 5A)**
   - Derelict building in tall building zone
   - Demolish + rebuild to 8 storeys
   - Capital: acquisition + phased construction

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)
