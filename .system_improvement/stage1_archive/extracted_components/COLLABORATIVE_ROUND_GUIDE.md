## Collaborative Round Guide 🔄

Maps patterns to exploration rounds in the v3.2.0 workflow:

### Round 2: Precedent Analysis
**Goal:** Which patterns help replicate successful planning applications?
- Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning (find similar approved schemes)
- Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (PTAL matching)
- Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly (precedent for infill)
- Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion (prior approvals)

**Why these patterns?** These rely on demonstrating that similar developments have been approved nearby or on similar sites. Success depends on finding comparable precedents.

### Round 3: Regulation-Driven
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit regulatory drivers and deadlines?
- Pattern 7: Permitted Development (Class AA, Q, MA, ZA rights)
- Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Article 4, expiring conditions)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (enforcement, S215 notices)

**Why these patterns?** These opportunities are created by regulatory changes, deadlines, or enforcement actions that create urgency or unlock new rights.

### Round 4: Structural Arbitrage
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit physical characteristics and constraints?
- Pattern 6: Airspace Development (roof extensions, party wall arbitrage)
- Pattern 9: Green Belt/Strategic Land (boundary anomalies, brownfield)
- Pattern 3: Underutilized/Inefficient Sites (layout inefficiencies)
- Pattern 4: Title/Access Issues (ransom strips, easements)

**Why these patterns?** These exploit physical, spatial, or legal constraints that others overlook or cannot solve. Value creation comes from structural problem-solving.

### Round 5: Behavioral/Motivation
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit seller motivation and market timing?
- Pattern 2: Motivated Seller (estate settlements, divorces, financial distress)
- Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage (Advanced Workflow) (emerging allocations, infrastructure announcements)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (combined with motivation)

**Why these patterns?** These depend on understanding seller psychology, market inefficiencies, and information asymmetries. Success requires empathy and timing.

### Cross-Round Patterns
Some patterns work across multiple rounds:
- **Pattern 11** (Distressed Assets): Regulation-driven (enforcement) + Behavioral (motivated seller)
- **Pattern 1** (Expired Planning): Precedent Analysis (prior approval) + Behavioral (frustrated owner)
- **Pattern 13** (Time Arbitrage): Regulation-Driven (policy changes) + Behavioral (information gaps)
