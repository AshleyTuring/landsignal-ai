# SYNTHESIS TASK - CHUNK 2 of 4

You are synthesizing improvements from peer reviews by Gemini and Codex.

## YOUR TASK
Create **Patterns 4-7** of FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.0:

4. **Pattern 4: Low Capital Entry**
   - Add concrete thresholds
   - Incorporate Codex's feedback about limited preset references

5. **Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification**
   - Add PTAL guidance and execution details
   - Address Gemini's feedback about completeness

6. **Pattern 6: Airspace Development**
   - Add legal workflow guidance
   - Incorporate missing preset variants (Codex feedback)

7. **Pattern 7: Permitted Development Strategies**
   - Already has good preset references
   - Enhance with additional quantified criteria
   - Add sub-patterns if suggested by reviewers

## KEY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT

- Add concrete thresholds (no more "appropriate size")
- Add preset references throughout
- Add "Manual Approximation" sections for pre-calculated presets
- Add cross-references between related patterns

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Output the full enhanced text for Patterns 4-7 (approximately 3,000-4,000 lines).
Include all markdown formatting, code blocks, bullet points, etc.

DO NOT output a summary - output the ACTUAL enhanced document text.
DO NOT repeat front matter - start directly with "## 4. Low Capital Entry"
