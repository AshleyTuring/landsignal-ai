# SYNTHESIS TASK - CHUNK 4 of 4

You are synthesizing improvements from peer reviews by Gemini and Codex.

## YOUR TASK
Create the **Final Section** of FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.0:

10. **Pattern 10: Renewable Energy Strategies**
    - Enhance with preset references
    - Add EV charging/bioenergy sub-patterns (Codex feedback)

11. **Pattern 11:** DELETED (merged into Pattern 9 - already handled in Chunk 3)

12. **Pattern 12: Commercial Traffic Strategies**
    - Add competitive context (Codex feedback)
    - Enhance with quantified demand metrics

13. **8 NEW PATTERNS** (from peer reviews):
    - **Pattern 14: Legacy Holdings** (Gemini - Part 2, new pattern #1)
    - **Pattern 15: Portfolio Divestment** (Gemini - Part 2, new pattern #2)
    - **Pattern 16: Brownfield Demolition** (Gemini - Part 2, new pattern #3)
    - **Pattern 17: Micro-Infill Service Yards** (Codex - Part 2, new pattern #1)
    - **Pattern 18: Nutrient Neutrality** (Codex - Part 2, new pattern #2)
    - **Pattern 19: Digital Infrastructure** (Codex - Part 2, new pattern #3)
    - **Pattern 20: Brand Covenant Reposition** (Codex - Part 2, new pattern #4)
    - **Pattern 21: Community Asset** (Codex - Part 2, new pattern #5)

14. **ADVANCED WORKFLOW SECTION** (NEW - relocated Pattern 13):
    - Title: "## ADVANCED WORKFLOW: Time/Information Arbitrage"
    - **CRITICAL:** Preserve ALL existing Pattern 13 content
    - Add prominent note: "This is one of the HIGHEST ROI strategies (Codex ranked #3)"
    - Explain it's a "force multiplier" that applies to any pattern you monitor
    - Include cross-references to specific patterns it leverages
    - Keep all existing sub-patterns: 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D, 13E

## KEY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT

### New Patterns Format
Each new pattern should include:
- Strategy description
- Source preset references (from PresetFiltersBuiltIntoSearchLand.md)
- Indicators (specific filters)
- Strategic Rationale
- Capital requirement
- Strengths/Weaknesses
- Implementation strategy

### Advanced Workflow Repositioning
**From Gemini (Iteration_Gemini.md:10-12):**
"The best solution is a synthesis of both positions: I was right about *what* it is (a workflow), but Codex was right about *how valuable* it is. It should be separated structurally, but its importance must be highlighted."

**From Codex (Iteration_Codex.md:600-605):**
"Time/Information Arbitrage should move out of the 13-pattern list into an 'Advanced Workflow' section that cross-references the underlying filters; it remains strategically vital but should no longer hold a numbered rank."

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Output the full enhanced text for this final chunk (approximately 4,000-5,000 lines).
Include all markdown formatting, code blocks, bullet points, etc.

DO NOT output a summary - output the ACTUAL enhanced document text.
DO NOT repeat front matter - start directly with "## 10. Renewable Energy Strategies"

End with the Advanced Workflow section.
