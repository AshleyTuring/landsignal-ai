# SYNTHESIS TASK - CHUNK 3 of 4

You are synthesizing improvements from peer reviews by Gemini and Codex.

## YOUR TASK
Create **Patterns 8-9** of FILTER_PATTERNS.md v2.0:

8. **Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities**
   - Enhance with preset references
   - Add concrete thresholds

9. **Pattern 9: Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds + Strategic Land** (MERGED)
   - **CRITICAL CHANGE:** Merge Pattern 11 (Strategic Land) into Pattern 9
   - Both reviewers agreed on this in iteration
   - Structure:
     * Pattern 9A: Grey Belt Exception (existing)
     * Pattern 9B: Edge of Settlement Promotion (existing, now enhanced with Pattern 11A content)
     * Pattern 9C: Emerging Allocations (from Pattern 11A)
     * Pattern 9D: Strategic Employment Land (from Pattern 11B)
   - Add Local Plan timeline guidance (Codex feedback)
   - Add SHLAA/edge preset references (Codex feedback)

## KEY MERGER DETAILS (from Iteration files)

**Gemini's Position (Iteration_Gemini.md:16-26):**
- Pattern 11A redundant with Pattern 9B
- Both about promoting land for allocation
- Should merge under "Strategic Land & Green Belt"

**Codex's Position (Iteration_Codex.md:614-619):**
- Pattern 9B already covers settlement-edge, unallocated land
- Pattern 11A repeats same logic but tags as "Emerging allocations"
- Consolidation removes duplication
- Still wants extra guidance (Local Plan timelines, infra costs) inside merged section

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Output the full enhanced text for Patterns 8-9 (approximately 3,000-4,000 lines).
Include all markdown formatting, code blocks, bullet points, etc.

DO NOT output a summary - output the ACTUAL enhanced document text.
DO NOT repeat front matter - start directly with "## 8. Regulation-Driven Opportunities"
