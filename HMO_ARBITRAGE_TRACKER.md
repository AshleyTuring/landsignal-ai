## OUTREACH TEMPLATE

Dear [Owner Name],

I noticed your HMO property at [ADDRESS] has an expired license.

I'm a property investor specializing in HMO properties in [AREA], and I'm actively looking to acquire properties like yours.

Would you consider selling?

I can offer:
• Cash purchase
• Quick completion (4 weeks)

• EPC upgrade costs (£5,000-£10,000)
• Ongoing compliance requirements
• Loss of rental income during repairs

I'd be happy to make you a no-obligation offer.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
