## Preset Categories (Detailed)

### Category 1: Permitted Development Rights (PDR) - 7 Presets

**Strategy:** Bypass full planning via PDR routes

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 4 | Class MA (pre-configured) | E commercial → residential, 2yr use, <4,000 sqmt | £100k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 6 | Class Q (pre-configured) | Agricultural → residential, suitable structure | £50k-£300k | 12-24m |
| 8 | Infill (pre-configured) | C3 + space for additional dwelling, road access | £50k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 30 | Class A | Houses: extensions/alterations, 7m+ height | £50k-£200k | 6-12m |
| 31 | Class G | Space above shops → 2 flats, <250 sqmt | £50k-£200k | 12-18m |
| 32 | Class MA eligible | E commercial in built-up, 100-8,000 sqmt | £100k-£500k | 12-18m |
| 33 | Class ZA | Small commercial rebuild, <1,000 sqmt, <18m height | £100k-£400k | 12-18m |

**Strategic Insights:**
- PDR = faster than planning (6-12 months vs 12-24 months)
- Class MA most popular (SearchLand calculates profit automatically)
- Size restrictions critical (e.g., Class G limited to 250 sqmt, 2 flats max)
- Conservation areas and AONB excluded from most PDR

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 7A-7D

### Category 2: Airspace Development - 4 Presets

**Strategy:** Add storeys to existing buildings (flat roofs)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 22 | Airspace: 8+ addresses | Flats, flat roof, 8+ units, freehold | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 23 | Airspace: Commercial no resi | E commercial, flat roof, no C3 | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 24 | Airspace: Pre-1990 | Built ≤1990, flat roof, 8+ units | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |
| 25 | Airspace: Unbroken freeholds | <1 leasehold, flat roof, 8+ units | £50k-£150k + build | 18-24m |

**Strategic Insights:**
- Flat roof = essential filter
- Freehold = simpler negotiation (no head lease)
- Pre-1990 = often undervalued, structural capacity varies
- Unbroken freeholds = no leaseholders to negotiate with
- Structural survey critical (cost £5k-£15k)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 6A-6B

### Category 3: Renewable Energy - 13 Presets

**Strategy:** Solar, wind, BESS, hydrogen, bio-energy projects

#### Solar Projects (5 presets)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 14 | Solar ground mount | 40k+ sqmt, Ag Grade 3b/4, <2km green substation | £500k-£5M | 12-24m |
| 34 | Commercial solar rooftops | B2/B8/E, flat roof, low EPC, 500+ sqmt | £50k-£500k | 6-12m |

| 83 | Solar manufacturing owner-occ | Manufacturing SIC codes, B2/E/E(g)(iii), 1k+ sqmt | £50k-£500k | 12-18m |

#### Other Renewable Energy (5 presets)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Capital | ROI Time |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------|----------|
| 51 | BESS (Battery Storage) | 20k-400k sqmt, <2km green substation, flat terrain | £5M-£50M | 24-36m |
| 52 | Bio-energy sites | Ag Grade 3b/4/5, <3km substation, >300m from built-up | £1M-£10M | 24-36m |
| 55 | Hydrogen sites | 8k-20k sqmt, <200m substation, >500m sensitive uses | £5M-£20M | 24-36m |
| 56 | Onshore wind | 20k-400k sqmt, Ag Grade 3b/4, >500m built-up | £5M-£50M | 24-48m |
| 45 | Ground-mounted solar GB | Green Belt + "ground mounted" + "solar" proposal | Varies | 24-36m |

**Strategic Insights - Solar:**
- **Ground mount:** Agricultural Grade 3b/4 essential (Grade 1-2 = planning refusal)
- **Rooftop:** Target high-energy users (manufacturing, warehousing)
- **Owner-occupied:** Easier than landlord/tenant (split incentive)
- **SIC code targeting:** Paper, poultry, manufacturing = high energy bills

**Strategic Insights - Other Renewable:**
- **Substation proximity CRITICAL:** <2km for solar/wind/BESS, <200m for hydrogen
- **Green rated substation:** Must have capacity (grid connection expensive if not)
- **Safety buffers:** Hydrogen >500m from schools/hospitals/care homes
- **Scale:** All require large capital (institutional investors)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 10A-10D

---

### Category 4: Regulation-Driven Opportunities - 6 Presets

**Strategy:** Regulation forces owner action (motivates sale)

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 12 | HMO expired licenses | HMO license expired | Cannot operate legally | £100k-£400k |
| 17 | Commercial expiring leases | Lease ends <2027, B2/B8/E, stale | Income cliff approaching | £200k-£1M+ |
| 41 | Fast food expired leases | E(b) food/drink, lease expired | Income ended | £100k-£500k |
| 46 | High footfall lease expiry | 6k+ footfall, lease 6-12m | Prime location, motivated | £500k-£3M+ |
| 66 | Office blocks expiring | E(g) offices, lease <2026 | Income ending | £300k-£2M+ |
| 78 | Single flats expiring leases | C3 flat, lease <2099, 1 address | Lease running out | £50k-£300k |

**Additional EPC-Related (implicit regulation):**

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Motivation Signal | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2 | Run down homes | EPC E/F/G, detached, <30% developed | Cannot rent legally | £100k-£400k |
| 20 | Unsold poor EPC | EPC E/F/G, sold before 2004 (20+ years!) | Cannot rent + tired owner | £50k-£300k |
| 36 | ECO4 | EPC E/F/G, 5+ addresses, private owner | Grant-eligible improvements | £200k-£1M |
| 47 | HMO opportunities | 8-12 rooms, low EPC, sold before 2014 | Conversion + improvement needed | £150k-£500k |
| 67 | Offices low EPC | EPC D/E/F/G, E commercial, office type | High energy costs | £200k-£1M+ |
| 69 | Older houses outdoor space | No sold date, low EPC, no apps 5 years | Legacy holding + cannot rent | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **HMO licenses:** Expired = illegal to operate → forced renewal (£1k-£3k) or sale
- **Lease expiry:** 6-12 months = peak motivation (owner deciding)
- **Vacant post-expiry:** Strongest signal (no income, carrying costs)
- **EPC E-G:** Cannot rent in private sector since 2020 → improvement (£5k-£50k) or sale
- **Combine signals:** E.g., expired HMO license + low EPC = double motivation

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 8A-8C

### Category 5: Green Belt Strategies - 5 Presets

**Strategy:** Exploit "previously developed" and edge-of-settlement exceptions

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategic Rationale | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| 7 | Grey Belt | 25%+ developed, 10%+ hardstanding, GB, <100m built-up | Previously developed exception | £50k-£300k |
| 43 | GB sites with hardstanding | 1%+ GB, 1k-10k sqmt, built-up or <100m | Edge + previous development | £50k-£300k |
| 44 | Grey Belt low GB review | GB Review score 1-2, 25%+ hardstanding, <100m built-up | Low environmental impact | £50k-£300k |
| 45 | Ground-mounted solar GB | Proposal "ground mounted" + "solar", GB | Renewable energy exception | £500k-£5M |
| 57 | Storage in Green Belt | Built-up, B2/B8, 0-20% developed, NOT GB (!?) | Note: Preset name misleading | £100k-£500k |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Previously developed land:** >10-30% hardstanding = brownfield status
- **Hardstanding = proxy:** Concrete/asphalt from demolished buildings, car parks
- **Edge of settlement:** <100m from built-up = less "green" objection
- **Green Belt Review scores:** 1-2 = low landscape/environmental value
- **Planning still required:** These are exceptions, not guarantees
- **Less competition:** Many developers avoid GB entirely (opportunity)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 9A-9B

---

### Category 6: Strategic Land Promotion - 8 Presets

**Strategy:** Promote sites into local plans or exploit allocations

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategy | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| 13 | Edge of settlement 2+ acres | 8k+ sqmt, private, <1 app, edge location | Promote for allocation | £10k-£50k option |
| 18 | Edge of settlement | 1k-8k sqmt, no sold date, <1 app 5yr, 1-10% built-up | Legacy holdings promotion | £10k-£50k option |
| 26 | Allocated 5-50 acres | 20k-200k sqmt, employment allocation, <100m A/B road | Strategic employment land | £1M+ per acre |
| 38 | Emerging sites no planning | Emerging allocation, <1 app, 4k-40k sqmt | First mover advantage | £10k-£50k option |
| 63 | Planning 10-100 units | 8k+ sqmt, 10-100 dwellings applied, in settlement | Existing planning | £500k-£5M |
| 75 | Residential allocations | 4k-40k sqmt, housing/mixed allocation, private | Policy-backed sites | £100k-£1M+ |
| 85 | Un-allocated no SHLAA 1-10 acres | NOT SHLAA, NOT allocated, <50m settlement, 4k-40k sqmt | Hidden gems to promote | £10k-£50k option |
| 86 | Un-allocated private 4k+ sqmt | Private, 4k+ sqmt, NOT allocated, <200m settlement | Edge promotion | £10k-£50k option |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Emerging allocations (#38):** Allocated but no planning yet = first mover advantage
- **No SHLAA (#85, #86):** Not assessed by authority = hidden opportunity to promote
- **Edge of settlement:** <50-200m from boundary = natural expansion direction
- **"No latest sold date":** Never sold = inherited/legacy (may not know value)
- **Option agreements:** Low capital (£10k-£50k), control site, promote to LA
- **Timelines:** 2-5 years for allocation → planning → sale
- **Planning expertise:** Essential for promotion strategies

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 11A-11B

| 29 | Car parks | Car park use, 1k-4k sqmt, <5% developed, <1 app 5yr | Redevelopment | £100k-£1M |

**Strategic Insights - Footfall:**
- **800+ footfall:** Minimum viable for cafe/restaurant
- **2,000+ footfall:** Good retail location
- **6,000+ footfall:** Prime retail (supports premium rents)
- **Data-driven:** SearchLand provides actual footfall counts (powerful)

**Strategic Insights - Vehicle Count:**
- **10,000+ vehicles/day:** Minimum for petrol/drive-thru/EV viability
- **Major road proximity:** Essential for visibility and access
- **EV charging:** Also needs <5km green substation (power supply)

**Strategic Insights - Niche:**
- **Padel courts:** Growing trend, 7-15m height = convert existing buildings
- **Care homes:** Demographics filter (aged 50-69) + hospital proximity
- **Car parks:** Often redevelopment opportunities (high land value, low use)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Pattern 12A-12C

---

### Category 8: Residential Infill/Improvement - 6 Presets

**Strategy:** Existing residential with development/improvement potential

| # | Preset Name | Key Criteria | Strategy | Capital |
|---|-------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Unbroken freeholds | 3-15 addresses, 0 leaseholds, private, C3 only | Split/repurpose multi-unit | £200k-£1M |
| 2 | Run down homes | EPC E/F/G, detached, <30% developed, 2k-4.1k sqmt | Rebuild/improve | £100k-£400k |

| 74 | Private C3 1+ acre land | Private, C3, 4k+ sqmt, 1 address, built-up, unconstrained | Large plot infill | £300k-£1.5M |

**Strategic Insights:**
- **Unbroken freeholds:** No leaseholders = easier to split or sell individually
- **Run down:** Low EPC + detached = demolish + rebuild often best ROI
- **Big gardens:** <5% developed = 95% of plot is garden (infill potential)
- **Private ownership:** Family homes, often unmotivated until approached
- **NOT on market:** Off-market opportunities (less competition)

**Related Patterns:** FILTER_PATTERNS.md → Patterns 1-4

---

## Key Strategic Learnings from Presets

### 1. Motivation Signals (NEW - from Preset Analysis)

**Regulation-Driven (Strongest):**
- ⚠️ HMO License Expiry Date (cannot operate)
- ⚠️ Lease end date (income cliff)
- ⚠️ EPC E-G rating (cannot rent)

**Time-Based:**
- No latest sold date (never sold = legacy)
- Latest sold date >20 years ago
- <1 application in last 5 years (no activity)

**Corporate:**
- Company status: Liquidation (from user discovery)
- 30+ titles owned (portfolio divestment)

### 2. Previously Undocumented Filters

**From Preset Analysis:**
- `Hardstanding percentage` (proxy for previously developed)
- `Agricultural Land Grade` (energy project viability)
- `SHLAA status` (strategic land indicator)
- `Green Belt Review score` (environmental impact)
- `SIC codes` (industry targeting)
- `Average daily footfall` (commercial viability)
- `Average daily vehicle count` (traffic-dependent viability)
- `Distance to green rated substation` (energy projects)
- `EPC recommendations contains "solar"` (improvement suggestions)

### 3. Clever Filter Combinations

**ANY Logic (Accessibility):**
Preset #10 (Padel):
```
Within 400m of bus stop OR
Within 800m of train station OR
Within 5m of built up area
```
→ Flexible accessibility requirements

**Compound Targeting:**
Preset #7 (Grey Belt):
```
Green Belt location +
25%+ developed +
10%+ hardstanding +
Within 100m built-up +
NOT: [long list of absolute constraints]
```
→ Multiple signals = "previously developed in GB"

**Strategic Constraint Targeting:**
Preset #13 (Edge of Settlement):
```
1-99% green belt coverage OR
1-99% another constraint coverage
```
→ Targets edge cases (partially constrained = opportunity)

### 4. Threshold Insights

**Commercial Viability:**
- 800+ footfall = Viable cafe
- 6,000+ footfall = Prime retail
- 10,000+ vehicles = Viable petrol/drive-thru/EV

**Energy Projects:**
- <2,000m substation = Solar/wind/BESS viable
- <200m substation = Hydrogen viable (high power)
- <5,000m substation = EV charging viable

**Size Thresholds:**
- Class MA: <4,000 sqmt title
- Class G: <250 sqmt (only 2 flats)
- Solar ground mount: >40,000 sqmt (10 acres min)
- BESS: 20,000-400,000 sqmt (5-100 acres)

**Hardstanding (Previously Developed):**
- 10%+ = Minimal indicator
- 25-30%+ = Clear previously developed
- 40%+ = Significant (car parks)

## Using This Guide

### For New Projects:

1. **Review relevant preset category** for your requirements
2. **Extract filter criteria** as starting point
3. **Apply learnings** from motivation signals
4. **Adapt to local geography** (e.g., PTAL = London only)
5. **Test empirically** (presets are proven but adapt to market)

### For Divergent Approach Generation:

- **Use presets as inspiration** for diverse approaches
- **Different preset categories** = different approaches
- **Combine patterns** (e.g., HMO expiry + low EPC + edge settlement)
- **Don't copy exactly** - adapt and improve

### For Validation:

- **Check against AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md**
- **Verify filter names exactly match**
- **Confirm units (acres/sqft/metres)**
- **Test thresholds** (presets provide proven numbers)
