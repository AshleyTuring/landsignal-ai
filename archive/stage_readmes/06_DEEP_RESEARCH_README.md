# Stage 6: Deep Research & Manual Enrichment

**Purpose:** Deep dive research on tenable properties + enrich DOSSIERS + final shortlist

**Prerequisites:** Stage 5 complete (tenable properties identified with draft dossiers)

---

## Workflow: Steps 9-10

### Step 9: Create Deep Research Plan

**For each tenable property, create research plan:**

`06_DEEP_RESEARCH/ResearchPlan_[PropertyAddress].md`

**Research Checklist:**

**1. Title Documents** ⏱️ 30 min | 💰 £3-£7
- [ ] Order from Land Registry (title number from SearchLand)
- [ ] Review ownership details (who, how long, restrictions)
- [ ] Check for restrictions, covenants, easements
- [ ] Identify any charges, mortgages

**2. Planning Portal Research** ⏱️ 1-2 hours | 💰 Free
- [ ] Search 500m radius for precedent applications
- [ ] Identify 5-10 similar approvals (height, use, scale)
- [ ] Identify recent refusals (what failed and why)
- [ ] Review officer reports (policy support, objections)
- [ ] Check local plan allocation (if any)
- [ ] Check emerging policy (local plan review)

**3. Comparable GDV Research** ⏱️ 1 hour | 💰 Free
- [ ] Rightmove/Zoopla: 10+ residential sales (same postcode, 2 years)
- [ ] Note: £/sqft, property type, sale date, condition
- [ ] Commercial comps (if applicable): rent/sale rates
- [ ] Estate agent consultation (free - market insights)
- [ ] Calculate realistic GDV range (conservative → optimistic)

**4. Constraint Checks** ⏱️ 1-2 hours | 💰 Free (basic) / £200-£500 (full)
- [ ] Environment Agency: Flood risk map (free online)
- [ ] Local authority website: Conservation area, Article 4, TPOs (free)
- [ ] Heritage England: Listed buildings within 50m (free online)
- [ ] Magic Maps: Ancient woodland, SSSI, SINC (free online)
- [ ] If viable: Commission constraint search (£200-£500)

**5. Market & Financials** ⏱️ 2-3 hours | 💰 £500-£1,000
- [ ] Quantity surveyor: Build cost estimate (£500-£1,000 for QS consultation)
- [ ] Architect: Feasibility sketch (optional, £500-£2,000)
- [ ] Financial model: Detailed Excel (revenue, costs, profit, ROI, IRR)
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis (best/likely/worst case scenarios)

**6. Professional Consultations** ⏱️ Varies | 💰 Varies
- [ ] Planning consultant: Pre-app advice feasibility (£500-£2,000)
- [ ] Structural engineer: If conversion/refurb (£500-£1,500)
- [ ] Solicitor: Legal review of title issues (if complex, £500-£1,500)

**Priority:** High MSI properties first (≥7 score)

### Step 10: Manual Enrichment

**Process:**

1. **Execute research plan** (checklist above)

2. **Update DOSSIER** as information discovered:
   - `05_SITE_VALIDATION/TENABLE/Dossier_[PropertyAddress].md`
   - Fill in blank sections with real data
   - Add evidence (screenshots, quotes from officer reports)
   - Update risk matrix with actual findings

3. **Further filtering** based on deep research:
   - Properties confirmed viable → keep in TENABLE
   - Properties with showstoppers → move to NON_TENABLE (with reason)

4. **Update Executive Summary:**
   - Deep research progress table
   - Properties excluded after deep research (with reasons)
   - Final shortlist count
   - ROI projections updated with real QS costs & GDV comps

5. **Create enriched DOSSIER:**
   - All 10 sections fully populated
   - Evidence attached (title docs, planning screenshots, GDV comps)
   - Professional consultation notes
   - Clear recommendation: PROCEED / PROCEED WITH CAUTION / DO NOT PURSUE

## Enriched DOSSIER Contents

**Transform draft DOSSIER (Stage 5) → enriched DOSSIER (Stage 6):**

### Section 1: Title Details ✅ ENRICHED
**Before (Stage 5):** SearchLand data  
**After (Stage 6):** Actual Land Registry title document
- Title number, tenure, exact area
- Owner name, ownership date
- Restrictions, covenants (verbatim from title)
- Charges, mortgages

### Section 2: Constraints Check ✅ ENRICHED
**Before:** Visual assessment from maps  
**After:** Verified constraints
- Flood risk: % in each zone (Environment Agency data)
- Conservation: Exact boundaries, restrictions (local authority confirmation)
- Heritage: Listed buildings with grades, distances
- TPOs: Exact tree locations (if site visit done)
- Constraint search report attached (if commissioned)

### Section 3: Planning Precedents ✅ ENRICHED
**Before:** SearchLand planning history  
**After:** Detailed precedent analysis
- 5-10 similar approvals (with application refs, dates, officer reports)
- Recent refusals (with refusal reasons, appeals)
- Policy citations (local plan paragraphs, NPPF references)
- Officer report quotes supporting viability

### Section 4: Comparable GDV ✅ ENRICHED
**Before:** Estimated £/sqft  
**After:** Real comparable evidence
- 10+ sales with addresses, dates, prices, £/sqft
- Estate agent consultation notes
- Conservative/likely/optimistic GDV range
- Evidence screenshots attached

### Section 5: Market & Financials ✅ ENRICHED
**Before:** LLM-estimated costs  
**After:** QS-verified costs

- Professional fee quotes
- Finance costs calculated (real interest rates)
- Detailed Excel model (revenue, costs, profit, ROI, IRR, NPV)

### Section 6: Risk Matrix ✅ ENRICHED

- Planning risk: Backed by precedent analysis & pre-app feedback
- Constraint risk: Backed by constraint search & specialist advice
- Market risk: Backed by comparable evidence & estate agent insights
- Build cost risk: Backed by QS estimate & contingency

### Section 7: MSI ✅ RE-CALCULATED

## Final Shortlist Criteria

**Property advances to owner approach if:**

✅ All 10 DOSSIER sections enriched  
✅ Final verdict: PROCEED or PROCEED WITH CAUTION  
✅ ROI ≥ target (£2M profit in example)  
✅ Capital ≤ budget (£200k in example)  
✅ MSI ≥5 (motivation sufficient)  
✅ No showstoppers discovered in deep research  
✅ Planning risk: LOW or MEDIUM (not HIGH)  
✅ Market risk: LOW or MEDIUM  
✅ Constraint risk: LOW or MEDIUM

## Budget & Time Estimates

### Per Property Deep Research:

| Task | Time | Cost | Priority |
|------|------|------|----------|
| Title docs | 30 min | £3-£7 | HIGH |
| Planning research | 1-2 hr | Free | HIGH |
| GDV comps | 1 hr | Free | HIGH |
| Constraint checks (basic) | 1-2 hr | Free | HIGH |
| QS estimate | 2-3 hr | £500-£1k | MEDIUM |
| Constraint search (full) | N/A | £200-£500 | MEDIUM |
| Planning consultant | Varies | £500-£2k | LOW (if viable) |
| **TOTAL (basic)** | **5-8 hr** | **£3-£7** | |
| **TOTAL (full)** | **10-15 hr** | **£1.2k-£4k** | |

**Recommendation:** Start with basic research (HIGH priority tasks) for all tenable properties. Only commission paid services (QS, planning consultant) for top 3-5 properties showing strongest viability.

## Quality Gates

**Stage 6 Complete when:**

- [ ] All tenable properties researched (at least basic level)
- [ ] All DOSSIERS enriched with real data
- [ ] Final shortlist identified (properties with all gates passed)
- [ ] Executive Summary updated with final counts & recommendations
- [ ] Learning captured in LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md (any new insights)

---

## Output: Ready-to-Approach Shortlist

**Final deliverable:**

1. **Executive Summary** (per approach) - Final status, ROI projections, recommendations
2. **Enriched DOSSIERS** (per property) - Complete research backing
3. **Shortlist Properties** - 3-10 properties ready for owner approach
4. **Approach Strategy** - Owner contact method, offer structure, timeline

**Next step:** Owner approach & deal negotiation (beyond system scope)

---

**Estimated Time:** 5-15 hours per property (depends on research depth)  
**Estimated Cost:** £3-£4,000 per property (if full professional consultations)  
**Recommendation:** Start with 3-5 highest MSI properties for full deep research
