## Iteration 1

### Gemini - Initial Filter Design
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-19

**Proposed Filters:**

#### Filter 1: Urban Redevelopment Hotspots

**Criteria:**
- Tenure: Freehold
- Use Class: E (Commercial, Business and Service)
- Max building height: < 12m (1-3 storey buildings)
- Title area: 800-2,500 sqmt
- PTAL: 4, 5, 6a, 6b (high transport density)
- Exclude: Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings, Green belt
- Applications in last 5 years: < 2
- Ownership: Company or Private owner

**Based On:** Loosely based on Preset #32 (Class MA eligible commercial sites) with added height and transport criteria

**Expected Profit:** £2,000,000 - £3,500,000

**Reasoning:**
Targets under-utilized low-rise commercial properties in prime urban locations with excellent transport links. By replacing low-rise buildings with 8-storey mixed-use, captures significant value uplift. Exclusion of constraints de-risks planning.

#### Filter 2: Expired Planning & High-Density Search

**Criteria:**
- Tenure: Freehold
- Planning Proposal keywords: (mixed-use OR residential) AND (storeys OR floors) AND (demolition OR replacement)
- Planning Status: Expired Permission
- Max dwellings applied for: > 10
- Last application: < 5 years ago
- Title area: 1,000-4,000 sqmt
- Ownership: Company

**Based On:** Custom filter (not based on preset)

**Expected Profit:** £2,500,000 - £5,000,000

**Reasoning:**
Directly targets sites where development principle already established through previous planning permission. Reduced planning risk since authority previously approved similar scheme. Higher profit potential due to de-risked pathway.

#### Filter 3: Low-Rise Commercial Blocks with Airspace Potential

**Criteria:**
- Tenure: Freehold
- Use Class: E(a) retail or E(g)(i) office
- Building has flat roof: Yes
- Max building height: 7-15m (2-4 storey)
- Developed area percentage: > 60%
- Number of addresses: 1-5
- Distance to train/tube station: < 800m
- Exclude: Article 4 restrictions

**Based On:** Inspired by Preset #23 (Airspace: Commercial, no resi) adapted for full redevelopment

**Expected Profit:** £2,000,000+

**Reasoning:**
Identifies well-located, low-rise commercial with flat roofs - prime for redevelopment. High developed area percentage means building upward is logical. Station proximity justifies 8-storey density. Combines security of existing commercial with high-profit demolish-and-build potential.

### Codex (OpenAI) - Critique & Improvement
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-19

**Analysis of Gemini Output:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Good targeting of urban, well-connected sites
- Smart use of expired planning permissions
- Recognizes airspace potential

⚠️ **Major Concerns:**

**Filter 1 - Urban Redevelopment:**
- £200k equity insufficient to secure, assemble, and redesign high-PTAL urban blocks
- Height cap (<12m = 3-4 storeys) CONTRADICTS 8-storey requirement
- Missing: air-rights capacity screening (building age, structural class)
- Missing: distressed owner signals for option agreements/JVs

**Filter 2 - Expired Planning:**
- Sites with lapsed consents at 1000-4000 sqmt trade well above £200k
- Should focus on high-rise precedents (20-30m heights) not just GIA
- Missing: policy-supported tall building zones
- Missing: housing delivery test failure areas (increases planning appetite)

**Filter 3 - Low-Rise Airspace:**
- 7m starting height = only 2-3 floors, achieving 8 storeys needs 20-25m final height
- Capital still insufficient without option agreements or mezzanine finance
- Missing: structural capacity filters (post-1980 concrete/steel)
- Missing: freeholder motivation signals

**Overall Issues:**
1. Funding approach not addressed - £200k requires options/JVs, not outright purchase
2. Height filters don't align with 8-storey requirement
3. Missing distress/liquidity signals to improve negotiating leverage
4. Missing structural build-up potential parameters

**Proposed Improvements:**
- Add height/zone/policy filters for 8-storey viability
- Include distress signals (receivership, vacant upper floors)
- Add structural capacity criteria (build date, construction type)
- Focus on option agreement opportunities vs direct purchase
- Target tall building policy zones

---

### Claude (Anthropic) - Final Refinement
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-19

**Analysis of Codex Output:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Correctly identified capital/purchase mismatch
- Accurately caught height contradiction (12m ≠ 8 storeys)
- Smart suggestion of option agreements/JV strategy
- Identified missing distress signals

⚠️ **Valid Concerns:**
- Codex is right: £200k cannot buy these sites outright
- Height filters must target 20-25m existing or tall building zones
- Need structural capacity and distress indicators

**Refined Filters (Addressing All Critiques):**

#### Filter 1: Distressed Commercial for Option Agreements

**Criteria:**
- Tenure: Freehold OR Leasehold (with suitable lease terms)
- Use Class: E, E(a), E(g)(i) (commercial/retail/office)
- Building height: 15-30m (5-10 storeys - realistic uplift to 8 storeys)
- Title area: 400-1,500 sqmt (viable for 8-storey mixed-use)
- PTAL: 4, 5, 6a, 6b (essential for planning consent at height)
- Property classification: Include "Vacant", "Derelict", "Inactive"
- OR Commercial lettings status: "Expired" OR "Expiring within 12 months"
- Latest sold date: >5 years ago (indicates potential motivation)
- Exclude: Conservation Areas, Listed Buildings, Article 4
- Company ownership: Company OR Corporate (more willing to negotiate options)

**Strategy:** Option agreement approach
**Capital use:** £50-100k for option fee, legal, surveys; £100-150k for planning costs
**Expected profit:** £1.5M-£3M (through option-to-JV with institutional buyer)

**Key Changes from Gemini:**
- Height increased to 15-30m (realistic for 8-storey target)
- Added distress signals (vacant, expired leases, old sale dates)
- Focused on option agreement strategy, not purchase
- Targeted company ownership (more commercial negotiations)

**Based on:** Hybrid of Preset #68 (Offices with no C3) + distress filters

---

#### Filter 2: Expired High-Rise Planning with Vendor Finance

**Criteria:**
- Tenure: Freehold
- Planning Applications - Proposal keywords: "(8-storey OR 8 storey OR eight storey) AND (mixed-use OR mixed use) AND (residential OR C3)"
- Planning status: Expired OR Lapsed permission
- Max building height applied for: >20m
- Last application submitted: 1-4 years ago (recent enough to be relevant)
- Title area: 800-2,500 sqmt
- Latest sold date: >3 years ago OR No recent sale
- Exclude: Active construction, Under offer
- Ownership: Private owner OR Company (not institutional)

**Strategy:** Conditional contract with vendor finance
**Capital use:** £100k deposit, £50k planning refresh, £50k contingency
**Expected profit:** £2M-£4M (vendor motivated by sunk costs)

**Key Changes from Gemini:**
- Specific keyword search for "8-storey mixed-use"
- Added height >20m filter (matches actual 8-storey requirement)
- Focused on vendor finance opportunity (sunk cost motivation)
- Excluded institutional owners (need flexible sellers)

**Based on:** Refined version of Gemini's Filter 2 with Codex's height corrections

---

#### Filter 3: Permitted Development Class MA + Airspace

**Criteria:**
- Tenure: Freehold
- Use Class: E (commercial/business/service)
- Property in Class E for: >2 years (meets Class MA requirements)
- Building has flat roof: Yes
- Max building height: 12-18m (3-6 storeys - can add 2 storeys PD)
- Title area: 300-1,000 sqmt (Class MA limit <4,000 sqmt)
- Developed area percentage: >70% (site efficiently used)
- Distance to station: <800m
- Latest EPC rating: D, E, F, G (suggests under-investment, motivated seller)
- Number of leaseholds: 0 (no encumbrances)
- Exclude: Article 4, Conservation Areas

**Strategy:** Class MA permitted development + planning application for full 8 storeys
**Capital use:** £150k for site control (smaller sites), £50k for PD + planning
**Expected profit:** £1.5M-£2.5M (reduced risk via permitted development route)

**Key Changes from Gemini/Codex:**
- Realistic height range for Class MA + additional floors
- Added "Class E for >2 years" (Class MA requirement)
- Focused on smaller sites achievable with £200k
- Added poor EPC as motivation signal
- Zero leaseholds = cleaner deal structure

**Based on:** Preset #4 (Class MA pre-configured) + Preset #23 (Airspace)

---

**Overall Assessment:**

**Convergence Status:** ✅ **CONVERGED**

**Confidence Level:** **HIGH**

All three LLMs now agree on:
1. £200k requires creative structures (options, vendor finance, smaller sites) not outright purchase
2. Height filters must reflect actual 8-storey requirement (15-30m existing or planning precedent)
3. Distress/motivation signals essential for negotiating leverage
4. Mixed-use C3+E focus maintained throughout
5. PTAL/transport connectivity critical for planning consent at height

**Key Consensus Points:**
- Filter 1: Option agreements on distressed commercial (Codex's suggestion implemented)
- Filter 2: Expired 8-storey planning with vendor motivation (Gemini's concept, Codex's corrections)
- Filter 3: Class MA + smaller sites (realistic for capital constraints)

**Ready for FilterResults.md:** ✅ YES

## Iteration 2

### Gemini - Response to Claude's Iteration 1 Filters
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-19

**Analysis:**

❌ **Filter 1 Issues:**
- 15m minimum height too low (only 4-5 storeys)
- Weak connection to 8-storey target - relies entirely on high-risk planning gain
- Fix: Increase minimum to 25m

✅ **Filter 2 Assessment:**
- Well-conceived, strongest filter
- Add: "Listed for sale >12 months" to increase motivated seller likelihood

❌ **Filter 3 Critical Flaw:**
- £150k purchase assumption UNREALISTIC for 300-1,000 sqmt with good transport
- Exhausts entire budget with no contingency
- Structural viability of adding multiple storeys not filtered
- Fix: Change to option agreement strategy, not purchase

**Agreement Level:** MAJOR CHANGES

---

### Codex - Response to Gemini's Critique
**Timestamp:** 2025-01-19

**Analysis:**

**Filter 1:**
- Agrees 15m too low (~3m per storey = 4-5 storeys, need to add 10m+)
- Minimum 25m correct
- ADDITIONAL ISSUE: Missing zoning/policy constraints (tall-building zones, HDT failures)
- Could surface assets where adding height is politically impossible

**Filter 2:**
- Agrees "listed >12 months" or price reductions needed
- ADDITIONAL ISSUE: No PTAL or tall-building designation checks
- Expired permissions outside supportive zones "dead on arrival"

**Filter 3:**
- "Major flaw" confirmed - £150k won't acquire these properties
- Need option/conditional contract like Filter 1
- ADDITIONAL ISSUE: 12-18m + Class MA still doesn't reach 8 storeys
- Path to 8-storey target not defined

**Agreement Level:** MAJOR CHANGES

---

### Claude - Final Iteration 2 Response

**Expected profit:** £1.5M-£2.5M

---

**Overall Iteration 2 Assessment:**

**Convergence Status:** ⚠️ **NEEDS VALIDATION**

All three LLMs now agree on:
1. Height filters must match 8-storey reality (25m+ or 18-25m for near-complete)
2. ALL filters should use option agreements (not purchase) for £200k budget
3. Policy support filters essential (tall building zones, PTAL, HDT)
4. Motivation signals critical (listings, old sales, expired leases, distress)

**Ready for Iteration 3 Validation:** ✅ YES
