Indicators:
- Last application submitted: >2-3 years ago
- Applications in last 5 years: <3
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Max number of dwellings applied for: >0 (confirms development intent)

Strengths: Targets sites where planning work already done but stalled
Weaknesses: May miss sites with expired planning but recent resubmissions
Capital requirement: Varies (often requires on-market listing filter)
```

### Pattern B: Proposal Keyword + Inactive Building
```
Strategy: Search for specific development types with inactive buildings
Indicators:
- Proposal: contains "[development type]" keywords
- Building on title is inactive: Yes
- Title area: appropriate size for target development

## Collaborative Round Guide 🔄

Maps patterns to exploration rounds in the v3.2.0 workflow:

### Round 2: Precedent Analysis
**Goal:** Which patterns help replicate successful planning applications?
- Pattern 1: Expired/Stalled Planning (find similar approved schemes)
- Pattern 5: High-Density/Intensification (PTAL matching)
- Pattern 10: Adjacent Development/Assembly (precedent for infill)
- Pattern 12: Strategic-to-Residential Conversion (prior approvals)

**Why these patterns?** These rely on demonstrating that similar developments have been approved nearby or on similar sites. Success depends on finding comparable precedents.

### Round 3: Regulation-Driven
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit regulatory drivers and deadlines?
- Pattern 7: Permitted Development (Class AA, Q, MA, ZA rights)
- Pattern 8: Regulation-Driven Opportunities (Article 4, expiring conditions)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (enforcement, S215 notices)

**Why these patterns?** These opportunities are created by regulatory changes, deadlines, or enforcement actions that create urgency or unlock new rights.

### Round 4: Structural Arbitrage
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit physical characteristics and constraints?
- Pattern 6: Airspace Development (roof extensions, party wall arbitrage)
- Pattern 9: Green Belt/Strategic Land (boundary anomalies, brownfield)
- Pattern 3: Underutilized/Inefficient Sites (layout inefficiencies)
- Pattern 4: Title/Access Issues (ransom strips, easements)

**Why these patterns?** These exploit physical, spatial, or legal constraints that others overlook or cannot solve. Value creation comes from structural problem-solving.

### Round 5: Behavioral/Motivation
**Goal:** Which patterns exploit seller motivation and market timing?
- Pattern 2: Motivated Seller (estate settlements, divorces, financial distress)
- Pattern 13: Time/Information Arbitrage (Advanced Workflow) (emerging allocations, infrastructure announcements)
- Pattern 11: Distressed/Non-Performing Assets (combined with motivation)

**Why these patterns?** These depend on understanding seller psychology, market inefficiencies, and information asymmetries. Success requires empathy and timing.

### Cross-Round Patterns
Some patterns work across multiple rounds:
- **Pattern 11** (Distressed Assets): Regulation-driven (enforcement) + Behavioral (motivated seller)
- **Pattern 1** (Expired Planning): Precedent Analysis (prior approval) + Behavioral (frustrated owner)
- **Pattern 13** (Time Arbitrage): Regulation-Driven (policy changes) + Behavioral (information gaps)

## 9. Green Belt/Constraint Workarounds ⭐ FROM PRESETS

### Pattern A: Grey Belt Exception
```
Strategy: Previously developed land in Green Belt (exception to protection)
Source: SearchLand Presets #7, #43, #44
Discovered: 2025-11-19

Indicators:
- Green Belt location (1-99% coverage)
- 25%+ area developed OR 10%+ hardstanding (previously developed)
- Within 100m of built-up area (accessibility)
- NOT: Flood zone 2/3, National parks, Conservation area, AONB, SSSI

Strategic Rationale:
- Green Belt protects greenfield, NOT previously developed land
- Hardstanding = concrete/asphalt (demolished buildings, car parks)
- Within 100m built-up = edge location (less "green")
- Planning policy allows redevelopment of previously developed

Strengths:
- Access to Green Belt locations (often cheaper)
- Exception to normal GB restrictions
- Less competition (many avoid GB entirely)

Weaknesses:
- Still needs planning (not automatic)
- Local opposition possible
- Must prove "previously developed"

Capital requirement: Often cheaper than pure urban (£50k-£300k)

Example Filters:

Grey Belt (Preset #7):
1. Freehold tenure
2. More than 25% area developed
3. More than 10% hardstanding (key indicator)
4. Within 100m of built up area
5. NOT: Flood zone 2, Flood zone 3, National parks, Conservation area, etc.
6. 1,000+ sqmt

Grey Belt Low Impact (Preset #44):

2. More than 25% hardstanding
3. Within 100m of built up area
4. NOT: Flood zone 3, Conservation area, AONB

Strategic Insight:
"Previously developed land in Green Belt" = exception
Hardstanding % = proxy for "previously developed"

Related: Presets #7, #43, #44, #45 (GB solar)
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "Hardstanding percentage"
```

### Pattern B: Edge of Settlement Promotion
```
Strategy: Sites on settlement edges for local plan inclusion
Source: SearchLand Presets #13, #18, #85, #86
Discovered: 2025-11-19

- NOT SHLAA assessed OR negative (hidden gems)
- Private owner (easier to deal)
- 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)
- Less than 5% developed (undeveloped land)

Strategic Rationale:
- Local authorities review settlement boundaries periodically
- Sites on edges = natural expansion direction
- No SHLAA = no one else promoting (first mover advantage)
- Promote to get allocated in next local plan

Strengths:
- Lower competition (undiscovered)
- Can influence local plan
- Option agreements with minimal capital
- Value jump when allocated

Weaknesses:
- Long timeline (2-5 years for allocation)
- No guarantee of allocation
- Requires planning expertise

Capital requirement: Low for option (£5k-£50k), patient capital

Example Filters:

Edge of Settlement (Preset #18):
1. Freehold tenure
2. Private owner ownership
3. 1,000-8,000 sqmt
4. Less than 5% area developed
5. Less than 1 application in last 5 years (no activity)
6. No latest sold date (never sold = inherited/legacy)
7. 1-10% built up area coverage (edge location)
8. More than 80% un-constrained

Un-Allocated No SHLAA (Preset #85):
1. NOT SHLAA positive/neutral/negative (not assessed!)
2. NOT allocated (any type)
3. Within 50m of settlement boundary
4. Company or private owner
5. 4,000-40,000 sqmt (1-10 acres)

Strategy:
1. Identify edge-of-settlement sites
2. Secure option agreement (low capital)
3. Promote to local authority (planning consultancy)
4. Get allocated in local plan
5. Apply for planning permission
6. Exit to housebuilder

Related: Presets #13, #18, #85, #86
See LEARNINGS_DATABASE.md → "SHLAA Status", "No latest sold date"

Strategy: Repurpose under-utilised institutional land for senior living or health hubs
Source: SearchLand Preset #28, #37, #62
Discovered: 2025-11-20 (Peer Review)

Indicators:
- Use class: F1, F2, C2, or E(f)
- Hardstanding percentage: >40%
- Site size: 650-10,300 sqmt
- Within 500m of hospital or major bus routes
- Ownership type: Private trust or non-profit (NOT corporate)
- Less than 1 application in last 5 years (optional)

Strategic Rationale:
- Under-utilised institutional land (schools, community halls, care homes)
- Near hospitals and town centres ideal for senior living or health hubs
- Recycling through JV with councils/trustees
- Community asset transfers before marketing
- Social infrastructure demand growing

Strengths:
- £2M-£10M GDV deal sizes
- Community support for appropriate uses
- JV structures with councils reduce risk
- Growing demand for senior living and health provision
- Planning support where councils target health provision

Weaknesses:
- 12-24 month planning timelines
- Complex stakeholder negotiations (councils, trustees)
- Community consultation requirements
- May require social value commitments
- Restricted use covenants possible

Capital requirement:
- £500k-£3M for site acquisition
- £2M-£10M total GDV
- JV structures may reduce upfront capital

Strategy:
1. Filter for F1, F2, C2, or E(f) use classes
2. Hardstanding >40% indicates existing development
3. Size 650-10,300 sqmt (manageable scale)
4. Within 500m of hospital or major bus routes
5. Private trust or non-profit ownership
6. Optional: no recent planning applications
7. Approach councils/trustees for JV partnerships
8. Structure community asset transfer or forward-fund extra care
9. Co-locate medical hubs where appropriate
10. Timeline: 12-24 months planning

# ADVANCED WORKFLOW

_This section contains meta-strategies that sit on top of the filter patterns._

**Note:** Pattern 13 (Time/Information Arbitrage) has been relocated here as it is a **workflow process** rather than a filter pattern. However, both Gemini and Codex agreed it is **one of the HIGHEST ROI strategies** (Codex ranked it #3). It acts as a **force multiplier** for any pattern you choose to monitor.

## 13. Time/Information Arbitrage Strategies ⭐ NEW

**Core Concept:** SearchLand refreshes data every 24 hours. Speed advantage = profit advantage.

### Pattern 13A: Real-Time Status Change Monitoring
```
Strategy: Be first to act on planning status changes, new allocations, or lease expiries
Indicators:
- Set up automated daily/weekly exports
- Monitor for status changes (approval, refusal, allocation)
- Contact owners/buyers SAME DAY before agents/competition

Implementation: Requires monitoring system outside SearchLand
- Daily export of target filters
- Compare today vs yesterday (diff analysis)
- Alert on NEW properties or status changes

Why This Works:
- Owner doesn't know market value of fresh consent yet
- Buyers willing to pay premium for pre-market exclusivity
- No agent competition (you're first)
- Time arbitrage = price arbitrage
```

### Pattern 13B: Fresh Planning Consent Alert
```
Strategy: Contact owner same day planning consent granted
Indicators:
- Planning status: Approved (filter)
- Decision date: Last 7 days (custom monitoring)
- Your action: Call owner immediately

Example Script:
"Congratulations on your consent. I have a buyer ready to move. 
Would £580k interest you?" (Owner unaware of £650k market value)

Profit: £70k in 48 hours (user example)

Strengths: Maximum information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires daily monitoring, fast response capability
Capital: Option agreement or cash purchase ready
```

### Pattern 13C: Lease Expiry Pre-Contact (90-Day Window)
```
Strategy: Contact owner 90 days before lease expiry (before void period)
Indicators:
- Lease end date: 60-120 days from today
- Use class: Commercial (E, B2, B8)
- Your offer: "Avoid void period, we have buyers ready"

Owner Psychology:
- 90 days out: Starting to worry about vacancy
- 30 days out: Panicking about lost income
- Post-expiry: Maximum pressure (carrying costs, no income)

Profit Source: Buy at "pre-panic" price, sell at market
```

### Pattern 13D: New Allocation Alert (Local Plan)
```
Strategy: Contact owner when site added to local plan allocations
Indicators:
- Housing allocation: Emerging (NEW)
- Applications in last 5 years: 0 (owner unaware)
- Your action: "Your site just got allocated—let's discuss before agent calls"

Example:
Day 1: SearchLand shows site added to emerging allocations
Day 1 (same day): You call owner offering £300k
Owner thinks: "My land was worth £150k yesterday, £300k is amazing!"
Reality: Market value post-allocation = £500k
Your profit: £200k by being first

Strengths: Massive information asymmetry
Weaknesses: Requires immediate action (speed critical)
```

### Pattern 13E: Fast Food Lease Expiry (High Visibility)
```
Strategy: Target high-footfall commercial with expiring leases
Indicators:
- Use class: E (restaurants/retail)
- Lease end date: Last 30 days (just expired)
- Footfall count: >2000/day (high value)
- Your action: Contact landlord (now in void period, cash flow pressure)

Why This Works:
- High footfall = high value but landlord may not realize
- Void period = immediate cash flow pressure
- Can offer "quick sale to avoid prolonged void"

Buyers: Fast food chains, convenience stores (high footfall valuable)
```

### Implementation Requirements

**System Setup:**
1. **Daily Automated Exports**
   - Export target filter results as CSV/JSON
   - Store with timestamp
   - Compare today vs yesterday (diff script)

2. **Alert Triggers**
   - New properties added: Email notification
   - Status changes: SMS + Email
   - Approaching thresholds (e.g., 90 days to lease expiry): Weekly digest

3. **Response Protocol**
   - Same-day contact for fresh consents
   - Script templates for different scenarios
   - Cash/option ready to move fast

**Tools Needed:**
- SearchLand API (or automated export)
- Diff comparison script (Python/Node)
- Email/SMS alerting system
- CRM for tracking contacts

### Capital Strategy

**Speed Capital:**
- Keep £50k-£200k liquid for immediate deployment
- Option agreements (£10k-£50k) for fast control
- Bridging finance arranged in advance (no delays)

**Profit Model:**
- Time arbitrage: Buy at "uninformed" price, sell at "informed" price
- Typical spread: 10-30% (£50k-£200k on £500k deal)
- Volume strategy: 10-20 deals/year = £500k-£2M profit

### Strengths
1. **Information asymmetry:** You know before owner/market
2. **No competition:** Pre-market, no agents, no bidders
3. **Premium pricing:** Buyers pay for exclusivity
4. **Scalable:** Automated monitoring, repeatable process
5. **High ROI:** Low capital, high profit margins

### Weaknesses
1. **Requires daily monitoring:** Labor-intensive or requires automation
2. **Speed critical:** Miss by 1 day = opportunity lost
3. **Competitive advantage erodes:** Once others adopt same strategy
4. **SearchLand dependency:** 24hr refresh only (not real-time)
5. **Execution risk:** Owner may not want to sell, buyer may back out

### Example Deal Flow

**Day 1 Morning:**
- SearchLand export shows planning consent granted yesterday
- Property: 4-unit scheme, Camden, owner-occupied

**Day 1 Afternoon:**
- Call owner: "Congratulations! I have a buyer at £580k, quick completion"
- Owner (unaware of £650k market value): "Yes, that sounds great!"

**Day 2:**
- Option agreement signed (£10k, 30-day exercise)
- Call buyer network: "Fresh consent, Camden, 4 units, £650k"
- Buyer: "Pre-vetted, no competition? Yes."

**Day 3-30:**
- Due diligence, legal, exercise option
- Completion: You buy £580k, sell £650k
- **Net profit: £60k** (after legals/costs)

**Annualized: 10 deals = £600k profit from speed arbitrage alone**

---

**Key Principle:** Test multiple approaches in parallel (divergent generation)

## Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

### ❌ Over-Constraining
```
Problem: Combining too many restrictive filters
Example: Applications = 0 AND Price <£200k AND Derelict AND On-market AND PTAL 6a
Result: 0 results (filters compound restrictiveness)
Solution: Test incrementally, use separate filter groups for different approaches
```

### ❌ Geographic Mismatches
```
Problem: Using London-specific filters (PTAL) for UK-wide searches
Example: PTAL filter outside TfL area
Result: 0 results
Solution: Create separate approaches for London vs rest of UK
```

### ❌ Assuming Non-Existent Filters
```
Problem: Designing strategy around filters that don't exist
Example: "Planning Status: Expired" or "Price Reduced"
Result: Cannot implement strategy
Solution: Always check AvailableFiltersInSearchLand_ACTUAL.md first
```
